-England, 1868-

Hey! Look at that wreck!

Yikes! This guy died on the spot.

They must've slipped in the mud
and fell off the cliff.

But boy do these nobles
have some fancy clothes.

Look!

The woman inside is dead,
but the baby is still alive!

She must have protected it.

A baby?!

Who cares about a baby?!

What are you doing?

What does it look like?!

I'm taking their jewelry!

What's that?

What a creepy mask.

It's worthless to me.

Give me a hand!

Let's yank out their teeth!

They'll fetch a good price!

You...

You came to rescue me.

Thank you.

My wife...

My wife and son...

Are they all right?

They cr-- Uh, I'm afraid your wife
and the driver are dead.

But the baby is safe.

Perhaps this is fate...

My name is George Joestar I.

I must thank you for saving my life.

Please tell me your name
while I am still conscious.

He thinks I came to save his life!

What a fool!

It won't hurt to say my name.

Dario Brando at your service.

Mr. Brando, the Joestars
will not forget our debt to you.

-12 years later-

There's a good boy!

I'm off, Dad!

Take care, JoJo!

Let's go, Danny!

Dio!

Come here!

Dio! Are you deaf, boy?!

What do you want, Father? Medicine?

Idiot! I don't want any snake oil!

If you have money,
go buy me some booze!

JoJo, manners!

Sorry, Dad.

Check.

Fine.

Feeling smart now, kid?!

Stop! Give it back!

Hey, Erina!
Your daddy buy you this doll?

He makes a lot of money
for being a quack!

I know!

Let's peel her clothes off!

We'll see if it looks like
the real thing!

She cried!
Erina's a crybaby!

Knock it off!

Give it back to her!

Who're you?

Erina's friend?

I don't know her,
but I'll fight for her!

You dumb jerk.
Fighting 'cause she's a girl.

Huh? He's a total pushover!

How embarrassing!
Now our brave knight needs saving!

This guy's the only son of the Joestars!

The one thing I can't stand
is a rich kid!

You stuck up snob!

Have some of this!

Dio, my time is almost up.

Listen!

When I die, take this letter
to the Joestar mansion!

They owe me something big.

You're a smart boy. Go out there
and become the world's richest man!

Just stay on your own land, rich kid.

Let's go.

Are you --

Just leave me alone!

Go away!
I didn't attack them for your sake!

I want to be a true gentleman!

You were a lady in distress.

A true gentleman has to be brave enough

to go into a fight he knows he'll lose.

But one day,
I'll be strong enough to win.

You were ugly and sly.

You drove Mom to death.

You were a terrible father!

You want me to be rich?

Don't worry. I will be.

And I'll use any means necessary.

I'll start with this Joestar.

You pig!

No one will bring me down.

Jonathan Joestar.

This is a tale of two youths and
a stone mask that alters their fates.

Chapter 1: Dio the Invader

Who is he?

You're Dio Brando, right?

And you must be Jonathan Joestar.

Everyone calls me JoJo.
Nice to meet you.

Danny!

See him? That's Danny.

He's my dog.

Don't worry.
He doesn't bite.

What was that for?!
You'll pay for that!

So this is the Joestar heir.

He looks like a pampered brat.

We'll see who has it all
after I get through with him.

What's the matter?

What's going on here?

I'm sorry. The dog jumped at me.
It was a reflex.

Welcome, Dio.

You are part of our family now.

Everyone, I owe my life
to this man's father.

Treat him as you would JoJo.

Yes, lord.

Dio, this is your home now.
Live like JoJo does.

Thank you for your hospitality,
Sir Joestar.

You've both lost your mothers
and you're the same age.

You should get along well.

JoJo, forget about Danny, all right?

Yes, Dad.

I'm sure I'd be surprised if a strange
dog jumped at me, so I understand.

I do wish he'd apologize.

But we'll be living together,
so I have to be nice.

This way, Dio.
I'll show you your room.

Yes, sir.

Hands off!

No one touches my bags!

Keep your dirty paws to yourself!

Got it?!

I was trying to help!

No thanks!

I'll have a servant carry them.

Listen closely, JoJo.

I might be your guest,
but I won't take any lip from you.

I always come first! I'm number one!

No one looks down
their nose at me!

But I just want to be friends!

And another thing, I hate dogs.

They don't scare me.
I just can't stand their bootlicking.

So keep that dumb mutt
Danny away from me.

What's keeping you two?

Hurry along.

Yes, sir!

With Dio's arrival, JoJo's happy life
spiraled into misery.

That's another mistake, JoJo!

Look at Dio!
20 out of 20 correct!

JoJo, you call yourself a gentleman?!

Where are your manners?!

Clear JoJo's place.

No dinner for you.

Looking at Dio, I see I've spoiled you.
I've been a shameful father!

Dio's manners are impeccable!

What an oaf.

In this corner is Jonathan Joestar!

He's looking stronger lately!

And his opponent...

...has been changed.

All we know is his name!
He's the new guy in town!

It couldn't be!

Introducing Dio Brando!

You know the rules.
One hit to the face wins it.

Begin!

- Get him, JoJo!
- Take him down!

Look at those moves!

I've never seen the like!

I can't connect!

JoJo is better than I had expected.

But...

I'll show him how we do it in the
bad part of town, Booth Boxing style!

Eat this!

There it is!

JoJo is out!

It's not over yet, JoJo!

I'll jam my thumb in his eye
and follow through!

Did you see that?!

Dio!

Dio, that was amazing!

How did you do that?

It's just a new defensive technique
in boxing.

I'll teach it to you guys as a favor.

Really?

But don't teach it to JoJo.
He can't keep a secret.

- He can't?
- Thanks for the warning.

Why?

Why do that on purpose?

Loneliness will make a man hollow.

I'll turn JoJo into an empty husk!

Bit by bit, I'll steal his life.
When I'm an adult, he'll have nothing.

Damn that Dio!

This is awful.

It's like he's taking over my life.

Hey! Get a move on!

Hey! What are you doing?

Come here!
Let me join in on the fun!

Did you guys hear something?

Ignore it.
It's just a snitch.

What?!

Get back here! Who's a snitch?!

Let's split.

You're a snitch, JoJo!

You'll blab to anyone
over anything!

Squealer!

Hold on! Get back here!

I never squealed on anybody!

JoJo the squealer!

Dio! Dio did this!

He's spreading wild rumors about me!

He's trying to destroy me
for some reason!

Curse you, Dio!

Ever since he showed up,
everyone's turned on me!

Danny, you'll be my friend
no matter what Dio does.

Who was that?

I feel like I've seen her before.

My handkerchief!

Aha!

Thanks for the grapes!

I'll be here tomorrow!
Come see me!

She went off without a word.
Girls are so cute!

In that dark time, Jonathan's heart
was spurred on by love!

They quickly became friends,
and Jonathan was enchanted by her.

Erina.
Erina Pendleton.

She's an angel!

What are you doing, JoJo?

JoJo! You can't do that!

You're no good!

See you!
Bye bye!

Hi. Are you Erina?

You and JoJo look happy together.

I knew something was wrong.

He's been happy
where he should be miserable.

He did it!

That's our Dio!
He's got way more guts than we do!

He's my idol!
I want to be him!

Have you and JoJo kissed yet?

Not yet, eh?

Your first kiss was not with him!

It was with me!

Even if I stole it, the fact
that I kissed her is enough!

Their little romance is over!

He won't have a single
friend or lover!

Look! What is she doing?!

What is she thinking?

She's washing with puddle water!

Is she nuts? There's a stream nearby!

You wench!

You're just doing that to insult me!

Dio, you fool! Don't lose your head
over a dumb girl!

We're done here! Let's go.

Hey, Erina!

Erina, wait!

This isn't right. What happened?

Look at that sorry look on his face!

Go tell him why she ran away!

But I just couldn't bear
to see JoJo cry!

Why you...

What did you do?

What did you do to her?!

Dio!

I wouldn't use my name lightly
if I were you.

This ends now!
I won't let you hurt her again!

Your fight is with me!

So you heard about your darling Erina?

Now you want to take revenge,
with your fists, eh?

I won't let you insult her!

You're just twisted by jealousy!

You want more of what happened
when we boxed?!

I can't beat him.

But if I lose here, I'll have to spend
my life cowering in Dio's shadow.

But most of all,
I have to fight for Erina's honor!

I'm going to pulverize him.

And I'll do it fair and square.

That way he'll know beyond a doubt
he can never beat me.

Not in a fight, and not in life.

Come!

That's it! That felt good!

How could he grab me after that kick?!

How about some more?!

Dio!

I'm going to beat you until you cry!

How could rubbish like him beat me?!

You...

You...

You...

You have a lot of nerve, don't you?!

He's crying.

You filthy cur!

What's going on, you two?!

Dad!

Boys fight. That can't be helped.

But JoJo, you were beating
Dio while he was down

and unable to defend himself!

- That's not civil!
- But --

No excuses!

To your rooms, both of you!

You'll both be punished later.

What's that box?

Oh, well.

I bet a maid threw it away.

What's that?

Something's banging around.

Is someone in there?!

No! They're burning alive in there!

Erina...

Damn that Dio!

This is what you were aiming for!

Well, you got what you wanted!

The sight of him was too much to bear,
so we buried him quickly.

The police say a burglar probably
wanted Danny out of the way.

Dio...

Dio? He hasn't returned from school yet.

JoJo went to his room and slept.

After he woke, he thought about Danny,

the companion he had lost, and cried.

I evened the score by killing that mutt,
but I had no idea JoJo was so strong.

The more you beat him,
the tougher he gets.

My anger makes me vulnerable.

I have to fix that.

I must learn to cool my temper.

Seven years passed...

Next episode

Seven years later...

And Jonathan Joestar steals the ball!

I just had a terrifying thought!

You said you'd be fine
missing four fingers!

Our friendship will be lost!

I'll defend my father, and my family!

Chapter 2:
A Letter From the PastSeven years later, in the year 1888...

-London's East End, 1888-

...Jack the Ripper stalked the streets,
terrorizing the women of London.

And a feud between JoJo and Dio would

unleash a new horror into the world.

Two stars fallen from the heavens

Swallowed by waters swirling
light and dark

Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other

The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor

And for the man who follows
his ambition...

...a sacrifice awaits

With pounding heart
and burning will

With thundering fists

And overflowing bravery

He steps forward, free of doubt

A fate determined by his blood

JoJo!

Chapter 2: A Letter From the Past

He caught it!

The ball is intercepted by
the school hero, Jonathan Joestar!

Joestar, the mild-mannered, 195-cm giant

sprints for the goal with a roar!

Can he win his last game
before graduating?!

He's been tackled!

But he's still standing!

Two more fly in!
Three men are on him!

Incredible!

He's dragging them along in
his charge toward the goal!

What power! What determination!
He's a juggernaut!

And another tackle!

He's wavering at last!

There's the pass!

It's good!

Look who caught it!

It's Dio!

That's our Dio Brando!

Can he make it?

He dodges one!

And another!

He's done it!

He's free!

He shows off his lightning speed!

Try!

They did it!

They've won their final game!

JoJo and Dio! What teamwork!
What an amazing duo!

We did it!

That was some fine running!

Yeah, but it was all thanks to you.

Dio aims to graduate
with top grades in law.

JoJo has written a fine
thesis on archaeology.

This victory belongs to them!
They're the pride of our school!

JoJo, let's tell Father
about this right away!

How long has it been since
my dad adopted Dio?

I smile and act friendly, but I can't
think of him as a real brother.

Why not? He's both talented and kind.

But I can't forget
what happened seven years ago.

Dio, can you tell us about
your friendship with JoJo?

That's an embarrassing subject.

C'mon. We want to hear.

Well...

Friendship?!

Don't stand next to me
with your idiot grin!

Once I graduate,
I'll have no use for Sir Joestar.

I've spent seven years patiently
waiting and playing along.

Now that I am old enough to take it,

the Joestar fortune will be mine!

How are you feeling, Father?

Better, except for this cough.

The doctors want me in the hospital.

You should stay away
from the hospital.

Hospitals don't cure anyone.
They're only after profits.

I won't go. I feel better at home.

My chest pains are better,
and the swelling has gone down.

I'm getting better.

It was only a cold.
Why has it gotten this bad?

Oh, and congratulations
on your victory today.

You already heard?

An old college friend informed me.

Some friend!

We ran home to be the first to tell you!

I'm very pleased.
I'm proud to have such excellent sons.

You've come especially far, Dio.

Follow your dreams
after graduation.

I'll support you in every way.
You're family.

I am grateful that you have
lifted me out of poverty.

I'll keep striving to improve.

Only I know about it.

What purpose could this mask
have been created for?

But it belonged to my mother,
so it makes me think of her.

I hope one day I can solve its riddle
and stir up a sensation!

Oops!

Thank you again, Dio.

I must be getting old.

Climbing stairs really wears me out.

I just had a terrifying thought!

Dio is...

Dio is...

Dio!

What are you doing with that medicine?

What do you mean?

Have you always brought
Dad his medicine?

Yes. Why?

I came across an old letter
written by your real father.

It says here, I'm terribly sick.

I know it will be the end of me.

My chest hurts, my fingers are swollen

and my cough won't stop.

Those are the same
symptoms as Dad's!

What's going on here, Dio?!

What are you trying to say?

I'm having this medicine checked!

If you doubt that medicine,
you doubt our friendship.

Our friendship will be lost!

I can't look him in the eye!

It's because I haven't confirmed
my doubt yet.

JoJo, put the medicine back on the tray.

We'll just forget this foolishness.

Dio, swear your innocence
on the honor of your real father!

If you can do that, I'll do as you say
and forget all of this!

If my hunch is correct, his prideful
personality won't let him do it.

Swear it to me, Dio!

Swear?

Swear on his honor?!

Don't be absurd!

That bastard never had any honor!

You just proved my doubt.

Your reaction is unnatural.

I don't know what happened between you

and your father, but you killed him.

I'll defend my father, and my family!

So that's how it is?

I see what you've been planning!

You never had any love for me!

I won't let you near my father!

I'll analyze this medicine
and give it to the police!

Damn it! I was so close!

Was him finding out an omen?

No! I won't let a worm like him
interfere with my plans!

I have no use for a dead woman!

He pushed Mother to death.

Just thinking his blood
flows in my veins drives me crazy!

There's no turning back now!

Dad, I'm going to London for a few days.

While I'm gone, only accept
medicine from these doctors.

You can't trust my treatment?

Please do as JoJo says.

I don't know his reasons,
but I trust my son.

D-Dad...

He's getting worse.

He may need an antidote.

I have to finish JoJo before he
finds out about the medicine.

And it has to be a perfect crime.

This mask reacted to my blood
seven years ago.

If those spikes enter JoJo's brain,
he'll die instantly.

And it will look like an accident,
so no one will suspect.

JoJo, your curiosity will
be the death of you!

-London, two days later-

Whoa!

The university couldn't
identify the medicine.

Chances are it's Asian medicine.

That means...

Young man, that's Ogre Street,
the most dangerous part of London.

I know, but I have no choice but to go.

You can leave if you want.

Dio lived in London.

Asian medicine
can only be found here.

I'll find it, my evidence
and the antidote.

Another dead end.

That cat was eating a puppy!

Take him, Tattoo!

Use that knife of yours
to slice that snob to ribbons!

I see this street has earned its name.

This idiot just grabbed my knife!

All I have to do is yank
and you'll lose four fingers!

Try it. The instant you pull,

my foot will hit your
groin like a sledgehammer.

I can afford to lose a few fingers.

I'm fighting to protect my family!

That's far more than you can say!

Tell me where they sell
Asian medicine around here!

Hey, you!

You said you'd be fine
missing four fingers!

Don't try to bluff me, rich kid!

Let's dance.

I have to find that shop
no matter the cost!

Have you ever fought before?
You're only covering your head!

That went to the bone!

The knife threw me off,
but my hat still got you good!

He's a monster!

That was no bluff! He was prepared
to lose both legs, let alone fingers!

His will has overcome his pain and fear.

I never should have picked a fight
with a guy as tough as him!

What? JoJo went to Ogre Street alone?

I'm sorry, but yes.

Don't worry Sir Joestar with this.

Yes, sir.

I guess I won't need to use the mask.

Has he already died like a dog?

S-Stop!

I won't allow anyone to lay
a finger on that gentleman!

Gentleman?

Tell me something.

Why did you hold back on me?

A leg like yours should
have totally ruined my face.

I'm here for my father's sake.

So I realized you must have a family.

I don't want to cause them grief.

Is this guy for real?
He's completely naive!

But...

Yes, my friends are all fine, too.

He's a true gentleman to the core!

I like your style!

Tell me your name.

Jonathan Joestar.

You're looking for Asian medicine?

The man who sells it is as sly as a fox!

JoJo's been gone for three days.

He does what he says he will.

He's really grown into a man.

That is why I was so hard on him,
maybe too hard.

I'm sure JoJo is dead
in an alley by now.

Did he find any evidence?

Why can't I stop drinking?!

Just like that wretched father of mine!

Damn it!

Watch where you're going, numbskull!

Hey friend, check if that brat
left a pee stain on my coat!

Are you deaf, you snot-nosed punk?

You won't get away with that!

A disgusting insect like you has a lot

of nerve to speak to me like that.

What an excellent opportunity.

I'll try this on you before
I use it on JoJo.

What are you blabbering about?!

A live-body experiment!

What is that light?!

Was I hallucinating?

He's dead.

Just a boring little toy for torturers.

Impossible!

He's alive!

What is he?

Those teeth!

What incredible strength!

He's not stopping.
Does he feel no pain?

He shattered my shoulder
with just a tap!

I have to jump into the river.

So thirsty...

I don't know why,
but I feel terribly thirsty.

He's draining my blood.

What the...

So this is the mask's secret.

But...

No! I don't want the sun
to be the last thing I see!

The sun...

What's the matter?
Why is it dark in here?

JoJo!

I have proof of your devilish plot!

Next episode

JoJo, I have a final favor to ask.

This guy stinks worse than
a pile of puke!

- I'm throwing away my humanity, JoJo!
- Dio!

TOP	Chapter 3: Time With DioI have proof of your devilish plot, Dio!

He's caught me.

But I won't run.

I came back here to fight JoJo!

Two stars fallen from the heavens

Swallowed by waters swirling
light and dark

Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other

The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor

And for the man who follows
his ambition...

...a sacrifice awaits

With pounding heart
and burning will

With thundering fists

And overflowing bravery

He steps forward, free of doubt

A fate determined by his blood

JoJo!

Chapter 3: Time With Dio

ADJUSTMENT	I found the antidote.

Dad just took it.

Dio, I'm heartbroken.

We were raised as brothers and now
I have to turn you in.

I'm sorry.

You might not believe that,
but I mean it.

That compassion is very like you.

JoJo, this is selfish,
but I have a final favor to ask.

Please, give me time.
Time to turn myself in.

What's this?

I expected him to fight
like a cornered animal!

JoJo, how did you make it
out of that slum alive?!

I'll have to distract him,
then with one quick stab...

I regret my life until now!

Being poor when I was a child
made me greedy!

What I did was wrong.

I tried to poison and rob
the man who raised me!

I came back to turn myself in.

If I wanted to run,
I could have gone anywhere!

T-That's true.

I want to make amends.

Dio --

Careful, Jonathan.
Don't trust a word that snake says.

Who am I, you ask?
Allow me to introduce myself.

I'm Robert E. O. Speedwagon,
the meddler.

I was worried about Jonathan,
so I came back with him.

Since I like you, Jonathan,
let me tell you something.

I was raised in squalor,
and I've seen a lot of lowlifes.

My nose knows the difference
between good and bad.

And this guy stinks worse
than a pile of puke!

I've never met a man
as wicked as him!

Wicked because of circumstance? No!

This man was born bad!

This face is familiar to you, isn't it?

This man has testified
that he sold you the poison.

I've heard enough.

This is truly a shame.

I put the same love and hope into you
as I did my own son.

Dad, you need to rest.

Right, I'll go to bed now.

I don't want to see my son arrested.

JoJo, do what you must.

Yes, Dad.

So this is the end?

They won't catch him.

That face and three moles on his ear...

He was born with the devil's own luck.

JoJo, I want you to be the one
to handcuff me.

For our years together.

All right.

Be careful, Jonathan!

JoJo, being human means having limits.

I've learned something.

The more carefully you scheme,

the more unexpected events come along.

As long as you are human...

What? What do you mean?!

I'm throwing away my humanity, JoJo!

I'm moving beyond humanity!

Where did you get that?

Watch out!

Shoot him now!

I'll use your blood, JoJo!

He...

Dad!

Fire!

JoJo...

D-Dad...

I should have dodged that knife.

I let the mask distract me.

You sacrificed yourself.

Keep this.

It was your mother's.

Dad!

That wound is fatal.

How could I let that happen?!

Sir Joestar... I told you...

It's my fault. If only I
had banished Dio's father.

Dio's father?

When I first joined the force,

there was a man who tried to pawn that ring.

It was Dio's father, Dario Brando.

Yes, it's definitely my ring.

We had a pair made when
we were engaged.

A burglar named Dario Brando
was trying to pawn it.

Brando!

Sir Joestar thought he owed
a life debt to Dario Brando.

But Brando was just a thief rooting
around for gold at the accident site!

Oh, no!

Did he happen to tell you that
I gave him the ring?

He did. What a flimsy lie!

It wasn't a lie.

I did give it to him.

I-Is that true?

He is innocent.

Let him go.

Why would you let him go?!

If I were born in his circumstances,
I may have done the same.

Sell this and buy something
for your family.

Then forsake criminality
and walk an honest path.

Sir Joestar knew the whole truth
before he adopted Dio.

Hang in there, Dad.
The doctors will save you.

JoJo, please don't hate Dio.

I am responsible.

I was hard on you because
you are my real son.

But in Dio's eyes, that may have been
unfair to him.

That could have driven him
to do what he did.

Please bury him next to his father.

Dad...

JoJo, it's not so bad...

...to die in the arms
of your own son.

Sir Joestar!

What a tragedy!

Now his kindness is gone from the world!

No!

Sir Joestar passed his noble spirit
along to Jonathan!

It has become his iron will, his pride
and it will create his future!

Normally I hate spoiled crybabies.

But they are different.

They live life with no regrets.
They're giants!

T-The body!

Dio Brando's body is gone!

You, cop! Get away from the window!

H-His head...

H-He's still alive!

How?! We filled him with bullets!

Watch out! I'm sure he has a weapon!

I-It can't be!

He's coming this way!

What are you waiting for?! Shoot!

Dio, stop right there!

Dio!

Hurry up and
pull the trigger, Jonathan!

He's not dead, even after that.

I don't get it.
I can't understand what's happening.

How could this be?!

JoJo...

This marvelous power comes from
the mask, and your father's blood!

He's sucking out that man's life!

Dio, just what have you become?!

I-I'm so confused...

The knife... Dad's death...
Blood... Dio... The mask...

My notes... The brain...
Unknown abilities... Unknown strength...

Dio, you aren't human anymore!

Dad...

Stop! You don't stand a chance!

I've never seen the like!
Anything that powerful is a monster!

You're right.

Honestly, I'm scared.

But Dio, I can't let you live like this.

It's my fault. I'll finish it!

Jonathan, stop! You'll just be killed!

The brain! The mask unlocks
the brain's hidden potential!

So in order to beat Dio...

The bodies!

Warm blood...

I want to lick it all up!

You don't mind if
I suck your blood, do you?

This is hard. He was my brother.

Dad, please lend me your strength.

I have to be strong.
Dio is no longer human.

He's a monster!

Watch out!

I can't let Dio kill another person!

H-He caught it!

Even after it went through his hand!

Wait, the hole in his head
has already healed!

He's completely immortal!

You're weak! So weak!

JoJo!

I have to play with you a bit more
to test out my new powers.

Even I don't know how far they go yet.

Hiding?

Didn't I just tell you?
Human schemes have their limits.

Cease your useless struggle.

Cowering behind the curtains, are we?
Come on out!

It's not a scheme. It's courage!

He's regenerating while he burns!

Is that the source of his immortality?!

This fire isn't enough!

What are you doing?!

Get out of here, Speedwagon!
This doesn't concern you!

You can't go up!
The fire is spreading!

Jonathan, what are you planning?

Come on up, Dio!

Dio, I won't let you go
beyond these walls!

Jonathan, don't!

Is he using himself as bait
to protect his friend?

It doesn't matter.

I'll just use your blood
to heal these burns.

Fleeing up here is useless!
Falling from this high won't hurt me!

Instead, now the fire has cornered you!

Dad...

Dad, I'll miss you.

Please go to heaven
along with those flames.

And then, help me accomplish my goal.

Give your strength to the fire.

What is Jonathan doing?

No! He couldn't be!

Stop! You mustn't do it!

H-Here he comes.

Utterly pathetic!

Suddenly, JoJo's youth
flashed through his mind!

My youth...
My time with Dio...

Now I'm going to settle the score
for all that time!

He's trying to make the fire
burn as hot as possible!

If the fire burns Dio faster than
he can regenerate, he'll die!

So Jonathan waited for the flames
to spread before going to the roof!

Don't do it!

H-How dare you!

The mansion my ancestors lived in
is burning.

Dad is dead, I have nothing left.
Nothing but my life.

I'll let myself burn!

I'll end your ambition
in exchange for my life!

Goodbye, JoJo!

For a second there I admired your guts.

Now cry tears of joy
since you can die with your dad, fool!

I'm beyond human! Invincible! Immortal!
I will rule this world!

JoJo, you gave me this power!

I can't reach!

Dio, I'm back!

What?! How?!

I won't let you go!

Your fate is sealed!

Here! This is the knife
you killed my father with!

I've crushed his arms to dust and he's

on fire, but he just won't let go!

Very well!
Let's go into the inferno together!

But you'll die alone!

I'll find a way to escape,
no matter how hot it is!

Dad! Lend me your aid!

A scream! A desperate cry!

Whether at an urge from beyond or

an instinct to use his burning home...

JoJo kicked!

And across from that spot...

What the --

...was a statue of the Joestar
family's guardian angel.

How could a worm like you...

I completely forgot!

The more you beat him, the tougher he gets!

JoJo!

This wasn't what my life
was supposed to be.

Jonathan!

Dad...

You're alive.

You're alive!

He...

He won!

There it is.

Next episode

Courage is knowing fear!

This guy's worse than Dio!

Wriggle in despair!

Who do I look like?

Please, teach me how to use Hamon.

Chapter 4: OverdriveJonathan won his battle.

But he lost everything to do so.

I brought him here three days ago.

He's totally alone.

I hope I can give him the will to live!

Two stars fallen from the heavens

Swallowed by waters swirling
light and dark

Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other

The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor

And for the man who follows
his ambition...

...a sacrifice awaits

With pounding heart
and burning will

With thundering fists

And overflowing bravery

He steps forward, free of doubt

A fate determined by his blood

JoJo!

Chapter 4: Overdrive

Spirit! What Jonathan
needs now is spirit!

It's the middle of the night,
but his room is lit.

What's going on?

That woman!

Has she been
attending to JoJo all this time?

Her hands are cracked from
being wet so long.

She must have cooled his burns
thousands of times!

I'm glad.

He's conscious!

You're through the worst of it.
You'll be fine.

You've been treating me?

You...

How could you be here?

You look like...

No, never mind.

It couldn't be.

You really look like her.

Who do I look like?

Erina Pendleton?

It's nice to see you,
Jonathan Joestar.

JoJo...

Erina, you've really grown!

Me? You've grown a lot more!

But...

It really is nice to see you again.

Yeah.

I wasn't cut out for that
sort of work, anyway.

I'll come back later.

Time for Speedwagon to play it cool.

I-I must have fainted.

Oh, dear!

But your arm is broken!

I'll always hold you.

Some people are just fated
to meet each other.

-Whitechapel, London-

You're out playing too late, you harlot!

Most humans are bound
by the laws of good.

They fear the power of evil.

But a rare few are born
unfettered by good...

...the evil elite.

I can use you, Jack the Ripper.

Submit your will to me.

I'll give you wondrous power
and unprecedented pleasure.

You need worry no more.

Only Speedwagon and I know
about the tragedy here.

The police think it was an accident.

But where is the mask?

I didn't find it in the rubble.

I hope it was smashed.

I think it was.
I want to forget all this.

JoJo!

Erina...

Who is he?

He's been following us.

Is something wrong?

No, everything's fi--

Mister Jonathan Joestar.

And the lady is Miss Erina Pendleton.

W-Who are you?!

You did well to survive
against the mask's power!

JoJo!

That's right. Squeeze every bit of air
out of your lungs.

JoJo!

He's injured! How could you?!

He's out of breath,
but there's no need to worry.

W-What on Earth?!

What's happening?

I feel so...

M-My arm!

I am Baron Zeppeli.

Courage alone won't
defeat the mask.

But my arm was shattered!

The pain is mostly gone.

I can even lift this rock!

That's incredible!

W-What did you do to me?!
Who are you?!

One question at a time, please, JoJo.

I did nothing.
Your breathing killed the pain.

Why did you do that to me?

How do you know my na--

H-He's gone.

I said one question at a time, JoJo.

I'll show you the answer.

Follow me.

What you will see
will change your destiny.

I struck your diaphragm with a finger
and altered your breathing.

How did you alter it?

Allow me to demonstrate its energy.

What does he plan to do?

What's happening?

L-Look at the water!

Those ripples are unnatural!

This is the same energy
that removed your pain.

Don't!

T-The frog wasn't hurt!

That was Sendo.

S-Sendo?

Hamon, or ripple energy, creates Sendo.

My Hamon energy went through
the frog's body and split the rock.

JoJo, I know for a fact the mask
is still intact.

Dio, the mask's master, holds it!

What?!

Did you just say Dio?!

I did!

I have sought the mask for decades!

I intend to destroy the mask
and vanquish its owner!

You are destined to fight
against the mask.

You must master Sendo
or face certain death!

And humanity will fall with you!

T-This is...

JoJo, what's going on?

What does he want?

Erina...

I can't let her get involved in this.

Anyone but her...

A-Astounding!

The blossoms!

U-Unbelievable!

The Hamon energy left from healing
his arm revived the blossoms!

This JoJo may be an untapped
wellspring of strength and talent.

This youth may be the one
who can save the world!

My power is slowly returning.

The food chain...

Pigs feed on grass.
Humans feed on pigs.

And we feed on humans.

Humans are our food,
so we are the true masters.

Bon appetit, Jack.

I'll start with a few wicked servants.

Next, the world!

It will all belong to me.

Humanity will kneel at my feet!

-One week later-

I studied Hamon under the tutelage

of the unfathomable Zeppeli.

I knew I had to defeat Dio.

And this is why.

JoJo, let me tell you why
I am hunting the mask.

It started when I was a young
Will A. Zeppeli.

At the time I had a limitless thirst
for the unknown.

I traveled the world as part of
my father's archaeological team.

One day, we were excavating
an Aztec site...

You mean...

That's right. It was my misfortune
to unearth that cursed mask.

On the voyage home, one of our team
donned the mask and chaos ensued.

He tore off the heads of his companions
in a bloodthirsty rampage.

The entire crew of 58 was killed.

I dove into the sea to escape,
but he followed me!

Suddenly, dawn broke!

In the light of the rising sun,
I saw his face.

It was the expedition leader...

...my father.

The ship drifted away
with the mask still aboard.

I was filled with dread

that the power of the mask
might be unleashed again.

I knew I had to find a way to stop it.

That path led me to the ways of Hamon.

Hamon energy comes from the flow
of one's own blood.

The mask drains energy
from the blood of others.

They are two sides of the same coin,
the same energy!

I see!
It's like using fire to fight fire!

Correct. Strike them with enough
Hamon energy, and they will explode.

And the waves created by Hamon...

...are the same as waves of sunlight!

Baron Zeppeli, please teach me
how to use Hamon.

I'll do anything to learn it!

I'll teach you, like it or not.

You will be Dio's first target
in his conquest of the world, JoJo.

Listen, JoJo.
Breathing affects your blood.

Your blood carries oxygen you inhale.

The oxygen in your blood
affects your body's cells.

Your cells are your body.

Like ripples in the water, breathing
properly creates Hamon in your body.

And that creates energy!

His arm suddenly extended!

How did he do that?!

It's called a Zoom Punch.

I dislocated my shoulder and extended my arm!

Hamon energy dulls the pain.

JoJo, do not break the rhythm
of your breathing.

Hamon energy is sensitive
to emotional disturbances.

Yes, sir!

Hey!

Jonathan!

Speedwagon!

We're headed for Wind Knights Lot?

That's right. I confirmed
that someone like Dio is there.

Many have gone missing there recently.

We have no time.
JoJo, your final test will be combat.

Yes, sir. I'm ready to do battle.

Same here!

Here's the entrance to
Wind Knights Lot!

We'll attack while the sun is still up.

I left without saying goodbye to Erina.

I will return to her!

What the...?

Driver, why have we stopped?!

Careful, there's no sun in here!

Hey, driver!

Is it Dio?

Where did he go?

Both of you, step away from the horses.

What in blazes?!
He was hiding inside the horse!

Jonathan, this guy...
This guy is bad news!

He's crueler and crazier than Dio!

So Dio's already gathered evil minions!

Stand aside, you two.

I'll do the fighting.

He's a zombie.

They feed on the living to gain
eternal life.

But they are mere puppets
that must obey their masters.

I'll let you enjoy the most
exquisite terror!

Once the blood has drained
from your faces, I'll drink every drop!

Wriggle in despair, little worms!

Now, what's his next move?

If I were him...

JoJo, this method of thinking is key.

First you must consider the situation
from the enemy's viewpoint.

If I were him, I'd cut off the route
to the sun by blocking the entrance!

He's collapsed the tunnel's mouth!

Jump, Speedwagon!

Here he comes!

H-He's covered in knives!

S-So that's how he
shish-kebabbed the driver.

Hamon Cutter!

My Hamon Cutter is far sharper
than your knives.

JoJo, here's your next lesson.

Think of a flea.

A miniscule insect, right?

Despite their size, they
see fit to challenge towering humans.

Should that be called courage?

I don't believe so.

So what is courage?

Courage must know fear
and make fear its own!

Fear upsets breathing!

Conquer fear and your breath
will never fail you!

Hamon breathing comes from courage!

A good human is a brave human!

Courage is a marvel of humanity!

Though powerful,
zombies do not know courage!

They are just like fleas!

Sendo Wave Kick!

My Hamon energy has disrupted
the zombie's body.

He didn't even spill his wine!

JoJo, you will finish him off.

Destroy his entire brain.
That's the only way to kill the undead.

Time for the slaughter,
you naughty little pigs!

I'll dice you to bits and eat you!

You're really going after him?!

It has to be done.

But JoJo will do it alone.

JoJo.

You must destroy him
without spilling a single drop.

One last lesson, JoJo.

In the land of Norway, they say
the north wind created the Vikings.

Spill a drop and
even if you destroy that zombie...

...I will abandon you.

Listen to yourself!
Have you gone insane?!

You stay out of this!

I'll do it.

The north wind created the Vikings.

It's a labyrinth.

It was made to create confusing
shadows even when lit.

O-Oh, no! The fire!

The light will only make me a target!

But now I have no clue
where he'll come from.

How fragrant!
The smell of fresh blood.

First I have to think like the enemy.

He must be close.

Next, I have to make fear my own.

I will control my breath.

Come! I'll chomp down on your carotid
and pull it out with my teeth!

The harsh wind from the Arctic Ocean
gave birth to the mighty Vikings.

In other words,
challenges can create opportunities.

Will that wine create a Viking?

If not, then Dio has already won.

These ripples! It's Hamon!

So my north wind is this wine!

The wine senses Hamon.

It goes through the glass, my arm,
my body, the ground...

I can feel his vibrations!

The wine is a Hamon detector!

My spirit trembles!

I'm burning up!

I've found you, zombie!

Pierce this wall!

Sendo Hamon Overdrive!

Come here so I can suck your blood!

Sounds like JoJo figured it out.

The north wind has made a new Viking!

Next episode

We meet at last.

I lay my curse upon you!

Can he overcome this delusion?

A duel between heroes!

Dio, I'm ending your madness!

Chapter 5: Knights of DarknessWind Knights Lot, a valley town
surrounded by sharp cliffs.

Built in the Middle Ages
to train knights...

...it now serves as a prison
where inmates mine for coal.

Farms and fishing give the town life.

Its population including prisoners: 517.

A terrible doom will soon visit them!

Two stars fallen from the heavens

Swallowed by waters swirling
light and dark

Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other

The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor

And for the man who follows
his ambition...

...a sacrifice awaits

With pounding heart
and burning will

With thundering fists

And overflowing bravery

He steps forward, free of doubt

A fate determined by his blood

JoJo!

Chapter 5: Knights of Darkness

Everyone is hard at work.

Things still appear peaceful.

But I know Dio is around here somewhere.

What happened?

Um, well, Speedwagon
has been begging me for a while.

So I thought I'd help him create
just a little Hamon.

And my finger kind of slipped.

I'm terribly sorry, Speedwagon.

W-Why...you...

It's a kid, sir.

Rather spry for such
a young cutpurse, eh?

Why are you just standing there?!

All of our money is in that bag!

That little devil!

A grab and dash in a single move.

Let's see...

I think he can serve us as a guide.

H-He's not sinking!

JoJo, if you're up to your knees,

you need to build up more Hamon energy!

That was a nice sound, JoJo.

Your Overdrive
passed through perfectly.

Do you think this is the spot?

No, a couple steps to the left.

I'll bet two pounds on it.

It shocked me!

Nice catch!

H-Huh? What's going on?

Who are you?

Something's wrong with the boy.

Did I use too much Hamon?

The boy is not the only thing
that's wrong.

Look around.

This is...!

A graveyard!

Looks like we were the ones
nicely caught in this trap.

The boy was under
some sort of hypnosis.

Jonathan, above you!

The sun is gone.

Time for your lives to go with it!

Dio!

T-They're crawling out!

I-I've been preparing myself
for this moment.

But I can't help being dismayed.

I'm sweating here!

That arrogant monster is
right there in the flesh!

He repaid Sir Joestar's love
with bloody betrayal!

I won't let him get away with it!

So that is Dio.

I see. He and his zombies
can't operate during the day.

So he hypnotized the boy and lured us

to an arena where he has the advantage.

A man of such guile
must not have the mask.

We have to destroy him somehow!

Zombie knights!

What's your name?

P-Poco!

All right, Poco.

Hang on tight!

Let's move, JoJo!

Yes, sir!

Zoom Punch!

Wow!

Dio Brando...

We've never met before.

But I say this to the mask
that has awakened you.

We meet at last.

Hey, baby!

Do you plan on fighting from that perch?

Come on down!

You're a cocky one for an insect.

I am the pinnacle of life.

A new being that will create the future.

I am incapable of sinking
down to a human level.

I've never felt such malice!
He already fancies himself a tyrant!

This is the only scar that has yet
to heal after my fight with JoJo.

Come, conjurer!

Let your blood salve this wound!

How many lives have you taken
to erase those scars?

How many slices of bread have you eaten?

Dio!

Baron Zeppeli!

I will handle this.

You're going to suffer!

Solar Hamon, shine on me!

Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!

He did it!

His Hamon is flowing up Dio's arm!

How feeble!

I-It's freezing!

No!

Zeppeli was it?

Your energy comes
from the flow of your blood.

So if your blood vessels are frozen,
you're powerless.

Know that I have absolute control
over my body.

I vaporized the moisture in my left arm.

When it vaporized, it sucked up heat,
flash freezing your arm.

And now!

Buffoon!

I'll smash through your arm
and your skull like a vase!

Dio, I'm ending your madness!

I feel Dio's wicked blood
flowing through his hand.

I'll take that as a compliment.

But you did quite well to stop my fist.

I must say I'm impressed.

JoJo!

JoJo, if I were you,
I'd keep my hands to myself.

Take this, Dio!

Once your arm is frozen,
blood will no longer flow through it!

Your Hamon energy will not work!

H-He's too strong!

He's five times as strong
as both of us together!

No! He'll freeze JoJo's arm
just like mine!

I can't let JoJo be hurt!

Baron Zeppeli!

T-This can't be!

S-So cold!

It's so cold it burns!

My skin is peeling
like I touched cold metal!

Baron Zeppeli's arm!

Without circulation, it will rot!

He can't be stopped without
solar Hamon!

Can we stand against him?!

Hamon?

A breathing trick?

If you want to huff and puff...

T-The ground is shaking!

...then you should trumpet
a fanfare in my honor!

Tarukus! Black Knight Blueford!

This fight is beneath me. Arise!

Make their screams
a fanfare dedicated to me!

W-Who are these creeps?!

Poco, run and hide!

In the 16th century, an ill-fated queen
was slain by Elizabeth I.

You, fierce knights who
served Queen Mary Stuart!

Settle this!

I leave the extermination
of these pests to you!

Enjoy.

He lifted and crushed that boulder
with just one finger!

Those two zombies are moving for JoJo!

T-There's no way he can handle both.

If I had a little circulation...

Then what?

I could heal my arm a bit.

Is there some way to thaw my arm?

Baron Zeppeli, you need to
heat up your arm, right?

Y-You have a plan?!

How about this?!

Speedwagon!

In the Arctic, people treat frostbite
by putting the wound inside a seal!

Zoom Punch!

Your blood is mine!

H-He's draining my blood!

Speedwagon, I...

I didn't come here
to slow you and Jonathan down!

If he can drink blood through his hair,
I can send Hamon up it!

Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!

It's not working!

Is this bloodsucker weakening my Hamon?!

I didn't give you enough credit.

I thought you'd be the type to flee.

I apologize.

I'll accept your apology
if we live through this.

I-I need to get my arm
into fighting form and fast!

That sight chills me
more than your arm did!

That blade makes
Jonathan's 195 cm frame look tiny!

That sinister black hair!
Those faces!

They have secrets!

I can read people,
and those two have secrets for sure!

Every Englishman knows the legendary
knights Tarukus and Blueford.

Even history bows to my will!

Long ago, around 1565, two queens
fought in a war of royal succession:

Queen Elizabeth I...

...and the beautiful,
23-year-old Mary Stuart.

The great knights Tarukus and Blueford
were her loyal vassals.

The pair had lost their families
and Mary accepted them with warmth.

Even the strongest man seeks respite,
not in romance, in something larger.

The pair found that in Mary.

They swore to honor her,
even if it meant ending their lives.

But one day, Mary's husband
Lord Darnley unexpectedly died.

Seeing a chance, Elizabeth blamed
Mary for Darnley's death.

The land turned against Mary,
and she was caught and imprisoned.

Tarukus and Blueford fought to free her.

Elizabeth bargained
with the two thorns in her side.

Turn yourselves in.

If you do so, I'll spare Mary's life.

There is no reason to refuse her offer.

I have no regrets.

The two were arrested...

...and executed.

Here are a few words as a parting gift:
Mary is already dead.

You were deceived.

See that lying over there
like a pile of rubbish?

That's your Mary.

You vile fiend, Elizabeth!
You betrayed us!

With my final breath I curse you
and all of your descendants!

I lay my curse upon you!

The knights were beheaded.

It is said that Tarukus's neck was stiff
with fury, and took several axes to cut.

Blueford's hair coiled around
his executioner's feet...

...digging into his killer's flesh.

And the story of their delusion
gave me goose bumps.

These legendary heroes cursed the world.

I dug them up and gave them life!

I turned them
into unstoppable revenants!

We swore fealty to Lord Dio!

We have come to end the world!
Death to everyone!

S-Such hatred!
Their scorn has been amplified!

Dio's made heroes into monsters!

Can JoJo overcome this delusion?

Hamon that burns in my left hand!

Scarlet Overdrive!

A-Astounding!

I-I had forgotten!
Much rides on Jonathan's shoulders!

His father's death
and his hope for the future!

And the hope of us all!

This boy has some skill.

He's perfect for warming up
after a 300-year nap.

This one's flesh belongs to me!

I'll gnaw on his yummy cartilage!

Another zombie!

This is no place for pawns.

W-What speed!

Lord Dio, this young man
has a great deal of spirit!

I ask for the pleasure of
drawing the curtains on his life!

As you will.

Tarukus, stand aside.

Black Knight Blueford, a supreme fighter
and utterly without mercy!

You can practically feel the pride
and skill flowing from him!

This is so strange.
I learned about him in school.

And now he's coming
to kill me.

I have to steady my breathing
and relax my muscles!

O-Oh, no! He's got both arms
behind his back!

Which will he attack with?
Or will he kick?

No! He uses his hair!

N-No!

You've got a keen eye
if you dodged my hair's Danse Macabre.

I'm enjoying this.

Jonathan!

This is bad!
He can't breathe down there!

He won't be able to use Hamon!

We have to go help him!

T-Tarukus!

Damn! We can't even help Jonathan!

It's already over.
He can't touch Blueford underwater.

My supervision is no longer needed here.

I'll now turn Wind Knights Lot
into a town of zombies!

Just one more night, then they will
spread through England like a plague!

I-I need to breathe to create Hamon!

Just one breath!

Now swim for the surface, boy.

You can't breathe down here,
and my armor weighs me down.

I won't use my sword.

This is a duel between heroes!

You need to make your move
before you drown!

Can I make it to the surface
before he does?

What are my odds?

As death threatened to take JoJo,
his explosive inner reserves awakened!

An ordinary man, his lungs screaming
for breath, would swim upward.

But not JoJo!

Instead, he turned and swam
deeper toward the bottom!

W-What is he thinking?

Hmm? Danny won't let go of your toy gun?

It's because you're trying
to take it away.

Change your thinking.
Try giving it to Danny instead.

Wind Knights Lot is a coal town.

That means the ground sunk long ago.

There!

There should be air trapped
under the rocks!

I found it!

With just one breath,
my blood's beat has returned!

I-Impossible!

The tables have turned on you!

Hamon will travel even better down here!

Underwater...

Turquoise Blue Overdrive!

Next episode

Blueford is a mess!

I'm a master of slaughter!

This pain is nothing.

You will be destined to die.

Life Magnetism Overdrive!

Chapter 6: Tomorrow's PluckHamon will travel even better down here!

Underwater...

Turquoise Blue Overdrive!

Jo--

JoJo!

H-He did it!

It's not over!

I can't believe he outswam
Hamon traveling underwater!

He's like lightning.
My Overdrive only scraped his head.

It'll take a solid punch
to send Hamon directly into him!

Lord Dio!

I thank you for giving me life and
the supreme honor of fighting this man!

He is made of the stuff of heroes.

Now we fight without
the burden of water!

Now we face each other using skill,
technique and spirit alone!

Hold nothing back!
Show me everything you have!

Even as Dio's puppet,
he hasn't lost his pride!

But it has been twisted into
a love of violence!

Your blood will be one with my body!

Another hair attack?!

Bring it!
I'll give you a dose of Hamon!

Two stars fallen from the heavens

Swallowed by waters swirling
light and dark

Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other

The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor

And for the man who follows
his ambition...

...a sacrifice awaits

With pounding heart
and burning will

With thundering fists

And overflowing bravery

He steps forward, free of doubt

A fate determined by his blood

JoJo!

Chapter 6: Tomorrow's Pluck

Overdrive Barrage!

JoJo!

T-This is bad. Hamon can only be
projected from the extremities!

He can't cut Blueford's hair
with his arms tied up like that!

I-I want to help him,
but we have our own problem!

Tarukus! H-He's gonna...

I-It's tearing through my clothes
and into my skin!

Struggling only makes it worse!

His hair is draining my blood!

Here's your coup de grace, pup!

I'll slice off your head
and bathe in a fountain of blood!

Try this instead!

Metal conducts Hamon, too!

Metal Silver Overdrive!

G-Good show!

He turned blocking the sword
into an attack using Hamon!

My heart resonates...

Heat enough to burn...

My blood's beat is razor-sharp!

Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!

Yes! There's the sound
of flowing Hamon I'm so used to!

S-Something is different about Blueford.

Now that I know his past
and personality...

This is for the best.

He is a zombie
trying to spread his vile kind.

He has to be destroyed.

I am the Black Knight Blueford.

This pain is nothing to me!

You're a mess, Blueford!

I can't believe his bloodlust
still drives him in that state!

What?!
What are you doing, Jonathan?!

Dodge or counter!
Why aren't you moving?!

What in blazes?

What are they thinking?

You said this pain just now.

Pain.

You feel pain.

T-The flowers!

They're blooming at his feet.

Black Knight Blueford's body
is being ravaged by Hamon.

But pain has returned to him.

The pain of being human.

As Hamon destroys his zombie form,
it is restoring his noble human soul.

That's why I stopped fighting you.

And that's why you stopped your sword.

His face is no longer twisted
by rage and hatred!

He looks like a son
peacefully talking with his mother!

You believed I would stop my attack.

Your trust kept you
from counterattacking.

Is your faith in humans so strong?

This pain means I'm alive.

If I can feel pain,
I can feel joy as well.

This is humanity.

I am filled with an odd tranquility.

I feel no bitterness.

Here, at the end, I have met
a marvelous man of true compassion.

I shall now return to my queen.

Companion of a world 300 years
younger than mine,

tell me your name.

Jonathan Joestar.

Jonathan, I grant you the word engraved

into the sword given to me by my queen:

Luck.

And for your future, I grant you this:

Pluck!

Sir Blueford!

What irony.

What a twisted fate.

Why did I have to kill him
in order to save his soul?

He left the world with hate,
but he had a proud spirit.

His noble heart was bent
to terrible insanity!

The mask caused this!

And I'll stop Dio, the man behind it!

JoJo! Behind you!

Tarukus!

W-What the...?!

How could he heartlessly stomp the armor

of his dear deceased friend?!

Blueford, you spineless dog!

I admired him,
but cunning was his game...

...while I chose to be
a master of slaughter!

I crush, kill and destroy
using brute force alone!

Let me hear your anguished cries!

Nice catch, JoJo!

The cliff is crumbling!

These leaves...

JoJo!

Yes, sir!

Life Magnetism Overdrive!

Grab on, Speedwagon, Poco!

Humans create a weak magnetic field,
making them living magnets.

An Overdrive can increase
that field's power.

Sending the field into the leaves,
they created a magnetic sheet!

Amazing!

You have a lot of tricks!

Are you guys, uh, human?

Were you sent down from heaven?

I've been wondering that, myself!
I'm totally baffled!

And Baron Zeppeli,
you're the biggest mystery of all!

Where did you learn to do this?!

I came across a mysterious man
at a port town in India.

He was young and shabby-looking,
but called himself a doctor.

I was in for a shock.

He took a gangrenous limb
and healed it with light from his hands.

It was the power of Hamon.

I felt that Hamon might be the key
to fighting the evil stone mask.

So I traveled far up Tibet's Salween
River in search of the doctor's master.

His name was Tonpetty.

Stranger from a distant land,
I can see your future.

Is it your desire to train with me?

To do so would alter your fate.

You will be destined to die.

I accept that.

I have a purpose worth
risking my life for.

I can't share Tonpetty's prophecy
with anyone, even JoJo.

Y-You all right?

T-That sound.
Is that Hamon, too?

I-It's not!

It's Tarukus!

H-He's insane to leap in
to attack us from that height!

This glider is made of pure Hamon.
Touch it at your own peril.

What's that?!

T-The old knights' training ground!

Jump for it before
Tarukus knocks us down!

That lunatic!
He slammed straight into the wall!

That'll destroy even a zombie.

Unlike Dio, he can't regenerate,
so he should be finished.

H-He's a machine!

He lives only for fighting.

His bones should've been
powdered by that!

He's climbing up!

Our goal is to destroy Dio,
but he insists on getting in our way.

We will eliminate Tarukus here!

JoJo, take the boy
somewhere safe inside!

There's something strange
about this door.

C-Careful! These ruins
are where the knights trained to kill.

They say it's full of traps!

Jonathan! Something's coming!

- Oh, no!
- JoJo!

W-What is this?!

Tarukus!

The Lair of the Two-headed Dragon.

A chain death match after
300 years of boredom sounds perfect.

The Lair of the Two-headed Dragon,
an ancient sparring ground!

Home of the chain death match!

I killed 48 here.

You could call this sport my specialty.

S-Stop, Baron Zeppeli!
It's just too thick!

Y-Yikes!
He's ruined his hands!

U-Unfortunately Hamon cannot
be used for destruction.

Bricks I can handle, but not this door.

JoJo is the same.

He cannot break the chain holding him!

The key to the collar on your neck
is right here!

The doors can't be opened
from the outside during a match.

The key to my collar is on yours.

That means that taking the head
of your opponent...

...is the only way out of here!

Overdrive!

T-The chain is touching the ceiling

so Hamon won't flow into Tarukus!

My left humerus is cracked.

I can use Hamon energy to fix it.

But to do that,
I need to get this collar off!

I can't breathe!

JoJo!

D-Damn!
I wet my pants!

I-I have to get away from these guys!

They've brought disaster to my town!

Baron Zeppeli, that lever!

The door can be opened from the inside!

JoJo will fight on his own.

But his battle with Blueford
has left him weak.

I don't care how!
We have to find a way to join him!

I don't see any way in!

It's too small.

They could never fit through.

But...

...maybe I could.

Blast it!

We can't get the door open.

We'll have to use the cliff entrance
Tarukus used.

B-But that'll take too much time!

We've got no other option.

I'm always on the sidelines!

I'm powerless!

I can do nothing to help!

Look at me, Poco!

I said look at me!

Aww, he's scared!

He's quaking like a leaf!

Look! Look!

He's gonna cry!

U-Uh oh!

L-Let's get outta here!

S-Sis...

Taking it from those bullies again?

Come on, now.

Why don't you try standing up to them?

I-I'll fight them...tomorrow!

So when is tomorrow?

Um, tomorrow.

Poco...

What is the scariest thing to you?

Is it that sting you feel?

Is pain scary?

Don't you think growing up
being unable to do anything...

...would be scarier than pain?

I-I...

Relax, baby brother.

I'll do the laundry when we get home.

Poco!

A window!

Hey! Don't go in there, you fool!

Stop him! Tarukus would butcher a man
going in there, let alone a child!

Listen, kid! It's too dangerous!

Think what will happen
if those monsters win!

If that big JoJo guy dies,
they'll attack our town!

They'll attack Sis!

I have to be the one to protect Sis!

Sis! Tomorrow is now!

Stay back! It's not safe!

Keep out of this, brat!

Poco!

Pain isn't...

...what's scary.

I did it.

You did well, Poco.

Don't worry, you're not that hurt.

Now, Baron Zeppeli!
Go in there and crush him!

Baron?

You will be destined to die.

At last...

Is it time for the prophecy
to be fulfilled?

If it is fate, I will simply accept it.

Baron Zeppeli!

What did you just say?

Next episode

This is just too cruel!

You'll pay, Tarukus!

I'll stomp you!

JoJo, please, take up my torch!

Chapter 7: The Inheritor-Tibet, 1863-

You have endured our training
for three long years.

You can run for dozens of miles
without losing your breath.

You will soon be ready for the training
we call the Celestial Gate.

However, I tell you again, Zeppeli...

...if you continue your training, you
will not be able to escape your doom.

The time for turning back is now.
You can still start a new life.

Master Tonpetty...

...please read the waves
of my life once more.

When am I destined to die?
Where am I destined to die?

What would you do if you knew?

I have a purpose in my life.
I cannot set it aside.

I want to know in order to
fulfill that purpose.

I will accept everything
when I know when I will die.

I will be satisfied.

Very well, if you feel
you are prepared...

...I will tell you.

In an ancient, hidden chamber
that reeks of death...

...a child will open the way.

In order to release a chained
young lion into the future...

...you will burn your own wounds
and after, a cruel death awaits you!

Baron Zeppeli...

Be careful, Baron!

Here I come, JoJo!

In order to release a chained
young lion into the future.

Two stars fallen from the heavens

Swallowed by waters swirling
light and dark

Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other

The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor

And for the man who follows
his ambition...

...a sacrifice awaits

With pounding heart
and burning will

With thundering fists

And overflowing bravery

He steps forward, free of doubt

A fate determined by his blood

JoJo!

Chapter 7: The Inheritor

This collar won't budge!

And Tarukus hasn't shown off any of his

tricks for fighting in this room.

That worries me.

Come, fools! You want to hit me
with some of your Hamon?

You cowards won't be able
to lay a finger on me!

What's the matter? Scared stiff?

Well done, Baron Zeppeli!

Try this, Tarukus!

Tornado Overdrive!

H-He just...!

Above me?

No, the chain is coming from below!

You're both right!

I call this the Hell Heaven Snake Kill!

I'll strangle you both to death!

I-I can't breathe.

My Hamon won't...

Jo...

JoJo...

Lord Dio, I have executed
both of them as you ordered.

Th-This is...

This is just too cruel!

Jonathan!

Still alive, even with
a broken neck, are you?

Allow me to finish you.

Jo...

JoJo...

The other one is still alive, too?

My ultimate...

My ultimate...

My ultimate technique
is now yours, JoJo!

JoJo, please, take up my torch!

Ultimate Deep Pass Overdrive!

JoJo, I have given you
all of my life energy.

B-Baron...

B-Baron Zeppeli!

I'll grind both of you into paste
beneath my boot!

Y-You...

Jonathan pulled Tarukus off the ground!

Baron Zeppeli's Hamon
healed his broken neck!

Idiot, you think you can yank that open?
You, a pathetic human?

I couldn't pull apart that steel

even with the power Lord Dio gave me!

You'll pay, Tarukus!

Jonathan!

W-What the...?!

You are utterly twisted by your madness.

You willingly sold your soul to Dio.

S-Such strength!
His body can barely contain his power!

Jonathan received Baron Zeppeli's power

and it has synergized with his own!

Tarukus, I will allow nothing of you
to remain in this world.

I will banish your evil spirit!

Drown in the depths of history!

Enough talk, you little brat!

Your little trick didn't work!

It's over!

Baron Zeppeli!

Baron Zeppeli...

I can't...

I can't believe this.

Without you...

Without you, what will we do?

JoJo, you fool!
Have you lost your wits?

This is no time to grieve!

Now...

Now you are...

Now go.

Defeat Dio.

Destroy the mask.

Baron Zeppeli!

I...

I am satisfied with my fate.

When I was young, I was married.

But I abandoned my family
to pursue the mask.

Even so, I am satisfied with my fate.

I accept it completely.

In the end, I passed along
all of myself.

JoJo...

...you are my hope.

Baron Zeppeli...

You feel like both a son
and a best friend to me.

And now I will live on...

...within you.

The 19th century novelist
William Thackeray wrote this:

To love and win is the best thing.

To love and lose is the next best.

So JoJo took up his mentor's
life's quest as well as his spirit.

Farewell, Baron Zeppeli.

P-Please...

Please spare the life of this child.

Let me confirm your desire, madam.

You will give your life to us,
but we must not touch your child.

Is that right?

Please, leave my child alone.

You move me to tears. Okay.

I, Dio, swear that

neither I, nor any of these
servants will harm your child.

However, all of them bowed to their fear

and gave their souls to me willingly.

It would be better for both you
and your child to join us.

You would have no worries.
There would be no hate between you.

Please, just spare this child!

Just this child...

Okay, okay...

My sweet baby!

We won't harm the child, as I promised.

Instead you do it yourself.

It is a tragedy of your own choosing.

Jonathan's expression has changed.

His face is darker.

And I am the same.

We must endure our sadness and anger.

We cannot grieve until Dio has fallen!

Jonathan, Dio said he would wipe out
the town in one more night!

Zombies will create zombies,
breeding like rats!

What is happening down there?

Is Wind Knights Lot still alive?

Is my sister all right?

Let's hurry.

Mr. Adams!

Poco, why are you
wandering about at this hour?!

Mr. Adams, is Sis all right?
Is the town all right?

Is she all right?!

You really think she's all right?!

She's furious!

She'll lock you in the
barn when you get home!

I guess the town is safe.

Let's move!

Thanks, Mr. Adams!

A child!

I want to drink the fresh,
warm blood of a child!

He's already been turned!

Can you escape this speed?!

It looks like it is too late.

That's correct.

The outskirts are infested with zombies.

Another one?!

My name is Dire.

A kick, but why so slow?

Try this! Thunder Split Attack!

H-He's incredible!

A normal man would pull his head back,
but he head-butted me instead!

Wait, Jonathan Joestar!

I am human.

Forgive me.

I wanted to see
how well Zeppeli has trained you.

Did you say Zeppeli?!

I did. He is a dear friend who has been

through 20 years of trials with me.

Indeed.

I am Straizo.

Look at this.

A letter...

It's from...

...Baron Zeppeli!

He sent that letter to request our aid.

He wrote about the location of the mask

and the man who bears it.

This is our master, Tonpetty.

A pleasure to meet you.

You're Baron Zeppeli's teacher,
Master Tonpetty.

Where I come from,
shaking hands is not a custom.

We greet each other this way.

And where is Zeppeli now?

I see. Zeppeli has passed.

Even if we had come earlier,
his fate would not have changed.

But this Dio's power is overwhelming!

His wicked might is quite extraordinary.

This town is now mine
and it took less than a single night.

Next episode

You fell for it, fool!

I will show you no mercy!

I'll feel no guilt for killing you!

Come, JoJo!

Chapter 8: Blood Feud - JoJo & DioPoco, where in blazes
were you at this hour?!

D-Dad...

I'm glad you're safe,
b-but where's Sis?

She went out to look for you.

She... She went out?!

Poco, what's the matter?
You're acting strange.

Sis!

Sis!

Two stars fallen from the heavens

Swallowed by waters swirling
light and dark

Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other

The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor

And for the man who follows
his ambition...

...a sacrifice awaits

With pounding heart
and burning will

With thundering fists

And overflowing bravery

He steps forward, free of doubt

A fate determined by his blood

JoJo!

Chapter 8: Blood Feud - JoJo & Dio

Think about this.

Take this lovely flower.

Your youth is blooming
just like this flower is.

Consider this carefully, mademoiselle.

If this flower blooms fully,
it will only wither away.

A shame, don't you think?

She's sweet sixteen!
So pure and innocent!

Look at how full of delicious
life energy she is, Lord Dio!

Those without manners
aren't fit to live.

So, mademoiselle...

I offer you a choice.

Wouldn't you like to enjoy
your youth for all eternity?

However, I will not force my friendship
upon you, unlike some.

You are free to choose your own destiny.

Devil.

What's that you said?

You're just a damned d-devil!

Alas. Though you will soon part,
allow me to introduce my companion.

This is the dreaded Doobie.

Since I am not to your taste,
you might enjoy his company.

Bye, mademoiselle.

W-Who's there?!

Who indeed?

There's no need
for introductions to a zombie!

Sis!

Poco!

Bit you! Bit you!

What's lurking under his mask?

L-Look at that!

That zombie is full of snakes!

Venomous cobras and flesh-eating vipers!

Surprised, are you?

Those snakes bit his face,
and not just once!

How troublesome.

I don't have time for Dio's games!

Impressive.
He squeezed out the poison.

He's learned a lot about blood flow
in a very short time.

It's because Baron Zeppeli gave
him his life energy before he died.

I'll use a bit of Hamon to
boil the blood of those snakes!

Sis!

Poco!

Sis!

I'm back from hell, Dio.

Still alive, JoJo?

I suppose that means
you've defeated my two knights.

Lord Dio, we await your order
to eliminate him!

I'll let my fangs
make an impression on him!

Dio!

No. This one...

This one I will handle personally.

Allow me to be frank, JoJo.

I didn't want to have
to do this personally.

We were raised in the same house.

Making you undead does not please me.

That's why I left this business
to my knights.

But in the end, I underestimated you.

Seeing you alive makes me realize
I was too soft of an emperor.

Now I will slaughter you
without a hint of hesitation!

Same here.
I'll feel no guilt for killing you!

By the way, what happened

to that dapper mustachioed
gentleman you were with?

Did he run off?

Dio, I must express my feelings.

This shames me as a gentleman, but...

...truth be told, I, Jonathan Joestar,
will kill you to satisfy my anger!

Come, JoJo!

Come, JoJo!

Dire!

JoJo, stand aside.

I have the right to satisfy
my anger first.

Zeppeli was a companion through
two decades of harsh training.

Dio, I will send you
straight to the bowels of hell!

Wait! He has hidden abilities
you don't know about!

What an interesting walk.

With enough training, humans are able

to make themselves float on the air.

But in just one night, I have gained
power beyond any human guru!

You think you can beat me
with such sleepy movements?!

You fell for it, fool!

Thunder Cross Split Attack!

Incredible! By crossing his arms

he can attack while keeping his guard up!

It's a perfect stratagem!

No fighter has escaped it.

He's...!

Useless! Useless! Useless!

I-I can't move!

He's been flash frozen!

Dio vaporized the moisture in his body,
turning him to ice in an instant!

Dire can't send Hamon into Dio
unless his blood is flowing!

That Dio is truly fearsome!
He froze Dire's whole body at once!

Y-You...

So feeble!

You thought you would ever
be able to touch me, fool?!

You came here just to die like a dog!

I'll give them all a good show!

- D-Dire!
- Stop!

JoJo, it's time.

You're the next one
to be sent to oblivion!

Dire!

A Hamon-filled rose's thorns do sting.

Dire!

How...

How dare you scar my face?!

Dire...

Speedwagon!

Here!

Dio, I've just seen the way
to beat your flash freezing.

I know how to send Hamon into you.

Dire spent his life to teach me.

I'll fill Blueford's sword of luck and
pluck with Hamon and slice you!

You dare touch me...

You dare touch me with your
Hamon filthier than frog urine?!

You've pushed your luck too far!

Now you'll be a feast for my zombies!

They'll gnaw the faces off your skulls!

Now he shows his true colors
as the worst man in the world!

His cool sophistication is
nothing but a cheap mask!

Now that he's had a humiliating taste
of Hamon, we see his real face!

I will show you no mercy!

I am Pajyu!

Jones!

Pluton!

Barnum!

Needle Vein Strike!

Roses are living things, so Hamon
will remain inside of them.

But steel is different.

I have to maintain contact.

There is a great horde of them.

I'll handle them for you.

As far as I can tell, Dio
is as swift as a leopard.

Thanks to Baron Zeppeli,
Jonathan just might keep up.

But Dio is strong enough to
pulverize flesh and bone with ease!

The battle will be decided as they meet
in the opening moment!

I'll squeeze the life out of you!

I'll cleanse the world of your evil!

H-He grabbed some roses
when I wasn't looking!

Now!

W-Wow!

He circled to Dio's right
because that eye can't see!

D-Damn! JoJo is a veteran fighter!

Y-Yes!

He finally defeated Dio!

Wrong,

you fools!

I-I...

I'm frozen!

So feeble!

Now you will become
one of my children of the night!

I've got your rubbery
carotid between my fingers!

So warm and springy.
What a pleasant feeling.

A kick!

My legs are frozen, too!

Useless! Useless! Useless!

Enjoy this anguish, JoJo!

Move and this delicate
blood vessel will snap!

I'll open your carotid and exchange
your blood for my vampiric essence.

W-We have to help!

Zombies!

Keep those peasants back
for a moment.

They just won't stop coming.

We won't be able to help.

Now, JoJo, I'll fill you with vampiric
essence and make you my slave!

Don't think you've won, Dio!
You've made a fatal mistake!

And how so?

You haven't frozen me completely
because you are still feeding.

If you freeze me, my Hamon will stop,

but you can't drain my life, either!

Your tactics are flawed!

He put the sword in the flame!

That blade is conducting the heat
faster than I can freeze it!

Hamon is coming up the blade!

Sunlight Yellow Overdrive!

Take this!

He got him!

Look again! You can tell that
the Hamon didn't go through.

My arm...

My arm is frozen again!

I only touched his face!

You underestimated me, JoJo!

I will admit it.
I admire your explosive tenacity.

I must say that your use of fire
was marvelous.

But JoJo, nothing can escape
my icy grasp.

Just a touch on the arm is enough.

I can freeze your whole body in
two seconds.

He squeezed out
the vampiric essence!

Jonathan hasn't given up yet!

Why are you puffed up like that?
Still looking for a fight?

No matter how you struggle,
human ability is limited.

Your Hamon training is useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

A monkey cannot stand
against a human!

And compared to me,
you are a mere monkey, JoJo!

Wrong! With enough conviction,
humans can do anything!

Humans will grow!
Let me demonstrate!

You won't, because
you'll be a zombie!

His hand, it's burning!

His glove is on fire!

It just might get through Dio's ice!

Which one of us will fall in the end?!

We find out now, Dio!

H-He was blocked!

No!

He's breaking through!

I'm disintegrating!

The pain! The burning!

My reign...was supposed...
to last...for centuries!

You had to be destroyed, Dio.

I won't...

He shot his essence from his eye!

He was centimeters
from incinerating my brain!

T-That was close!

The last throes of a demon
clinging to life in this world.

Dio's falling down the cliff!

Dio...

He's fainted!

He's worn out. He should be.

He's seen too many fatal fights tonight.

But why would he cry
after killing a bad guy like that?

He spent his youth together with Dio.

But me? I can smile happily!

Are you watching, Baron Zeppeli?
He did it!

Jonathan finally did it!

Dio is dead.

It may sound like an exaggeration,
but the world is saved!

Next episode

What a joyous occasion!

These are tears of joy.

R-Run...

I want to stay like this forever.

Is my new body here?

Chapter 9: The Last HamonM-Move, arm!

The Hamon will fill my head!

I have to do something
before that happens!

Lord Dio!

We'll find you a new body.

An excerpt from the December 4, 1888
edition of The London Press:

"73 of the 452 people living in Wind
Knights Lot went missing overnight."

"Investigators have one lead
based on witness accounts."

"Four outsiders were seen burning
a man's clothing at the cliff's base."

"One of them was seen smashing
a curious stone mask with a hammer."

Our work is done!

Two stars fallen from the heavens

Swallowed by waters swirling
light and dark

Their ripples move outward,
pulled toward each other

The sun will guide the man
who walks the path of honor

And for the man who follows
his ambition...

...a sacrifice awaits

With pounding heart
and burning will

With thundering fists

And overflowing bravery

He steps forward, free of doubt

A fate determined by his blood

JoJo!

Chapter 9: The Last Hamon

Joestar heir Jonathan Joestar weds

Erina, only daughter of the Pendletons!

They plan to spend their
honeymoon in America.

Good heavens!

Look at the time!

They're about to depart!

Hey!

Hi, Mr. Speedwagon!

You almost missed seeing them off!

Sorry I'm late.
So where are they?

They're on the ship.

It's about to set sail.

What?!

Where can I see them?!

Father STYX...

...we expect much
from your mission to Mexico.

I'll do what I can.

Jonathan! Where are you?!

Gangway!

What weighs so much in this thing?

How should I know?
Some weird Asian told me to move it.

Hey. Did you guys hear that?

Quit flapping your gums and move!

We don't get paid till the job's done!

Ouch! What a bunch of louts!

Mr. Speedwagon!

Look! There they are!

Hey!

Mr. Joestar!

What a joyous occasion!

Make a happy life for yourselves!

I'll always be here for you.
If you need me, I'll come running!

Though I might just get in the way.

Mr. Joestar!

Bon voyage!

-Atlantic Ocean, en route to America-

One bird all alone,
separated from its flock?

Erina...

Is something wrong?

Why are you crying?

These are tears of joy.

Because I am with you.

Even back then, you strove
to be a true gentleman,

no matter the consequences.

And now the proud
Jonathan Joestar is in my arms.

I feel the same way.

When my heart was frozen in despair,
you came and warmed me.

I am happy to have saved a world
with you living in it.

I wish Dad could've met you.

Erina, let's go and eat!

Jonathan!

I was about to tell you
to watch your head.

I hope today never ends.

Crap, that's the engine room.
It sure fell into a filthy place.

I could just sell it,
but it makes me money.

Dear Lord...

You sure do like picking on me.

I couldn't. I've never had alcohol.

Try a little. Just a sip.
It's not that strong.

Give it a taste.

Here.

Y-You're...!

Jonathan?

No!

There's no way...

Dio is...alive...

Erina, go to our room and
don't forget to lock the door!

What's with this trunk?
The lock is open.

That's funny.
I can see a catch glinting inside.

That means...the trunk
is locked from the inside!

Stop!

You're...!

Is my new body here?

D-Dio!

Jonathan is worried.
There's something wrong.

JoJo, look.
See what has become of me.

There is a reason
I come before you in this state.

Why would I show you my weakness?

Because, JoJo, though I once
despised you, I now respect you.

I respect your courage,
your spirit and your power.

I realize that now.

Dio!

JoJo...

If it weren't for you,

I never would
have obtained the mask's power.

But because of you, the world
has slipped from my grasp.

If there is a god who controls fate,

I am sure he bound ours the tightest.

Our two existences are truly one.

I will take the body of
the only man I respect

and live in eternal glory!

That is the destiny laid out for me!

You will feel no pain,
that is my last gift to you!

His eyes...! No!

Live on as my body, JoJo!

Jonathan!

J-Jonathan...

Eri...na...

What a pity.

If you had just held still,
it would have been a painless death.

Torn from your fairy tale into hell,

unable to understand or even speak?

Did JoJo never tell you of me,
the mythical dweller in the dark?

I may not look like much, but surely
you remember me, Erina Pendleton.

No, it's Mrs. Erina Joestar now,
isn't it?

Dio!

The ship's full of monsters!

As you ordered,
I drained the life of one passenger.

And now most of the ship
has joined our family!

And now we go to America.
Isn't that right, Lord Dio?

I can't speak.

I can't even breathe.

Erina... Erina!

I have to save...

I can't charge my Hamon.

Behold, Lord Dio!

The sniveling whelp can't breathe!

He'll cause no mischief
with Hamon now!

This is what he gets for
crossing you, Lord Dio.

Now it's time to play.

Or shall I just wait a few minutes
for him to suffocate, hmm?

Listen, Wang Chan!

I'll tolerate no insult to JoJo!

He is the man who brought me
to my current state.

Show him some respect by severing
his head painlessly.

Yes, Lord Dio.

And now my dear friend's body
will become my future!

Jonathan!

He's up to something!
Stay back!

He might have one last trick
up his sleeve!

He can do nothing!
Surely Lord Dio overestimates him!

Now I'll scoop out what little brains
you have with my fingers!

Must...save Erina.

I'll have to use the last bit of Hamon
left in my body all at once.

A little will do.

Look out, Wang Chan!

S-Something broke inside of my body.
Something important.

N-No!

This... This is the end.

My last Hamon.

It was too weak to destroy
that zombie completely.

But it was enough.

W-What the...?!

JoJo must have done something
to Wang Chan's body!

He disrupted its functions
without destroying it.

He's made it cling tightly
to the machinery.

A-And the device it's clinging to...

...is the paddle's screw shaft!

The strength of a zombie is enough
to stop the paddle!

If the shaft stops, the steam inside
the piston will keep building up!

And after a while...

...the ship will explode!

Jonathan, this can't be.

How could this happen to us?

R-Run, Erina.

The s-ship will explode.

I don't know exactly what is going on.

It's too much for me.
I don't know if I should cry or scream.

Maybe I should just faint away.

But I can say one thing.

Erina Joestar...

...will die with you.

In the warmth of these lips, alas,
I feel the touch of death.

Jonathan Joestar is dying.

But we're together.
I want to stay like this forever.

Until the ship explodes
and everything burns.

Until everything is gone.

It's all right to cry.

But you...have to keep living.

It's like a storybook!

You want me to save a baby and run?

To me, that heroism is cruelty.

My only wish is to die with you.

That woman died to save her child.

My mother did the same for me.

Go with the baby. Hurry!

You plan to destroy the whole ship!

JoJo, you really never give up!

But neither do I!

I will live! No matter what!

Along with your body!

Zombies!

Devour Wang Chan's body
and restart the piston!

It's starting to explode.

Jonathan!

It's already exploding!

I have to protect myself
from the sun at all times!

So I am already prepared
in the event of an explosion!

Erina, take a good look!

Now that JoJo can't use Hamon,
I can safely steal his body!

Then I will step into that trunk,
my humble boudoir.

That little shelter can withstand
a blast made by a ton of dynamite!

Here I come, JoJo!

And I bid you welcome,
my new, eternal body!

Jonathan!

Dio...

Like you said, our fates might truly
be one in the same.

I feel an odd warmth toward you.

Now our lives are bound completely.

And they will vanish
along with this ship.

Fare...well...

...Erina.

Let me go, JoJo!

Release me!
Think about it!

You'd like a shot at eternity, right?

I can heal your wounds!
You can live forever with Erina, JoJo!

JoJo?!

He... He's...

He's dead.

Jonathan Joestar
Died February 7, 1889

Jonathan Joestar
passed away into oblivion.

His life was a piece of history
invisible to ordinary people.

They will never hear the tale
of his noble accomplishments.

But his descendants will.

The new life that was inside me

at that time will surely hear his story.

Erina Joestar was rescued
soon after near the Canary Islands.

And the book of the stone mask
closed for a time.

But this was only the beginning
of a new adventure.

Part 1: Phantom Blood -- Fin

Next episode

It was the fall of 1938.

Nice to see you, Speedwagon.

How did you know that, bastard?

Take him down!

I'm Joseph Joestar.
Call me JoJo.

Chapter 10: JoJo in New YorkThis old man is familiar to us.

Well, at least his bearing
and scar should be.

Nice to see you again, Speedwagon.

I hear you're an oil tycoon
in America now.

That's an exaggeration.

You look as young as ever, Straizo.

I can't believe we're the same age.

Hamon energy is life energy.
I must say I envy you.

49 years after Jonathan's death,
a new age has arrived.

Straizo has succeeded Master Tonpetty,

and Speedwagon has made a fortune.

They set off for Mexico
to see something.

That something was discovered by

a digging team founded by Speedwagon.

That something was a secret known
only to those select few.

When you witness this, I think,
no, I am sure you'll feel a chill.

It's frightful enough to make
your hair stand on end.

It's even worse than the terror we faced

50 years ago when we fought Dio.

This place is tremendous.

This is why I summoned you.

I-It's...

...the mask!

There are so many of them!

New York, 1938

It was the fall of 1938.

I was out looking for a mark as usual.

You must be kidding!

You've never heard of this beverage?

By your accent, I'd say
you're from England. Tourist?

Oh? You just moved here, eh?

Anyhow, if you want a drink, pay me.

Money is the rule here.

Hey, friend!
He took your wallet! After him!

What a sucker!
Piece of cake!

Hey, Smokey. Looks like
I finally caught you red-handed!

You worthless street scum!

I'll make sure
they lock you up for 20 years!

Take it easy!
I only pinched a wallet!

I hate all of your bottom-feeding kind!

But I'm a nice guy.

Bring me twenty dollars
every week.

Plus half of what you steal.

Excuse me.

Oh, it's the stooge who got robbed.

I'm keeping your wallet
as evidence.

Well, how should I put this?
Let's see...

That wallet was actually a gift
to him, officer.

The 195 cm giant of an Englishman
was covering up for me!

So I need you to let go
of the wallet and the boy.

What's that?

Like I said, it was a gift.

He's a close friend of mine.

Please let him go.

A close friend?

Tell me your close friend's name.

Don't lie to me!

You want to spend some time in the pen?

You bonehead!

I'm curious.

I don't understand why you did that.

What was the purpose behind it?

There's no purpose!
I do what I feel like, dimwit!

If someone wipes a booger
on your right cheek, then--

You picked the wrong man
to mess with, pig!

Y-You're resisting arrest!

Shoot me!
But I'm warning you!

When you pull the trigger,
I'll break your finger like a match!

Not from over there!
I'll blow your brains out!

Suddenly, it seemed to me
like his body was glowing.

It was like magic.

The cap flew off with enough
force to snap the cop's finger!

I lost my temper again!

N-Now I'm in trouble.

G-Granny Erina will be furious!

W-What is this guy?

He beats up cops and then worries

about what his granny will say?!

So, Mr. Pickpocket,
shall we high-tail it?

He didn't know how he launched
the bottle cap with such force.

He said he could always do it.

His grandpa died young,
but he could do the same thing.

His dad died in the War,
but had no such talents.

He didn't have a mom, either.

I owe you big time.

My name's Smokey.
What's yours?

Joestar.

Joseph Joestar.

Battle Tendency

Chapter 10: JoJo in New York

You can call me JoJo.

What is this?
Who is the man in that pillar?

It's not a carving.

He has amino acids. He has cells.

And though faint,
he has body heat and a pulse.

This man is alive!

Straizo, what is he exactly?
How long has he been here?

What are the masks for?
Why is he here?

None of that matters!
We have one purpose here!

I called you so that you
could destroy him utterly

with Hamon while he sleeps!

What of Joseph Joestar?

How is the young man doing?

I hear he used Hamon
to save your life once.

Why bring JoJo up now?

I believe it was back
when he was 13 years old.

Yes, some men hijacked your plane
so that they could ransom you.

Hey, kid! You can't stay back here.
Get up front!

You're hijacking Speedwagon, right?

I'm just a bystander.

I'm just going to read my comic.
You go do your business.

Don't give me any lip, punk!

JoJo!

T-This is bad.

That suit were a gift from Erina.
That'll set him off for sure!

Take it easy, JoJo!

You guys knew the plane might crash
if you hijacked it, right?

Was that Hamon?

T-The kid is crazy!
We're gonna crash!

Grab the yoke!

I can't fly!

Wrap the pilot in this!
We're jumping!

You never think things through!

I do think.

At least enough to keep
you and Granny Erina safe.

You're my only family, after all.

He looks just like his grandfather,
but he's far from a gentleman.

That was when I discovered
that Joseph could use Hamon.

So he inherited Hamon breathing
from his grandfather Jonathan.

That's right.

But why bring that up now?

W-What the devil?

I just killed these men.

And when you die...

...Jonathan's grandson will feel
grief and anger.

He will grow to hate me.

S-Straizo!

Straizo...

A-Are you mad?!

Quite the opposite.
My thinking is very clear.

I chose the path of Hamon
in order to forge my body.

But as I trained, the aging of my body
became painfully clear to me.

Hamon gives only the slightest edge
over ordinary people.

Its practice cannot prevent
the aging process.

In the battle all those years ago,
I secretly admired Dio.

He was powerful, beautiful
and immortal.

I coveted the power of the mask.

I didn't care who got in the way!

Y-You've become twisted, Straizo.

Your blood will now
grant me immortality.

With you gone, only Erina and

Joseph Joestar will know of the mask.

Once I am rid of them, I'll take my time

and learn more of the mask than Dio did!

Y-You mustn't!

T-There are terrible things
we don't yet know!

Eri...na...

Jo...Jo...

Why don't you look
where you're going, dolt?!

Go find a dog
to lick your butt clean!

Now get out of the way, you...

Hello! What was that? Slow down!

Say that again so that I can
understand your gibberish!

I might have to smack you!

JoJo.

What are you doing?

G-Granny Erina!

What are you doing to that man?

Well, uh, you see...

Taxi!

I was just grabbing a taxi.

Oh, JoJo, you're so thoughtful.

Climb in, Smokey.

The Joestar family,
just a grandmother and grandson.

Over time, I heard bits of their past.

Granny, Speedwagon called us
all the way to New York, right?

And now he's off on a trip?
He's unbelievable.

I'm sure his oil business
has him tied up.

Hey, Granny...

Was Speedwagon really
Grandpa's best friend?

That's all? Really?

What are you implying?

Well, he's single, right?

And you're a widow.

I just wondered if that was
the extent of your relationship.

You scoundrel!

Sorry! Ow!

I was wrong! Forgive me!

I know Speedwagon is just loyal!

The Joestars were short-lived.

Erina lost her husband
in an accident at sea.

The son she was pregnant with and

a girl who survived the wreck married.

They became JoJo's parents,
but were claimed by war and disease.

Granny Erina was extraordinarily gentle,

to punks like me and anyone else.

Maybe it was because she was lonely.

JoJo was the same.

Their kindness got him into trouble.

It was for my sake.

Hey, waiter! Waiter!

Yes?

You let that stinking animal in here?

His odor is ruining my appetite!
You shouldn't let that kind in!

Sir, as long as the bill is paid,

we are happy to serve anyone.

What? You mean you'll let
beasts like that eat beasts in here?

I'll just be on my way.

JoJo!

Granny, you aren't going
to stop me, are you?

No. People can have
their own opinions...

...but he insulted a friend in public.

Take him down,
but mind the other customers!

I was hoping you'd say that.

Looking for a scrap, boy?

If you're looking
for your brass knuckles...

...they're not in your coat pocket!

Check your back pocket!

No way!

Now you'll say,
"How did you know that, bastard?!"

How did you know that, bastard?!

By the abrasions on your right hand,

I know you fight using brass knuckles.

Plus, the blood
on your shirt isn't yours.

You just came from a fight.

Since the blood is on your shirt,

I know you took your coat off to fight.

So when you removed your brass knuckles,

you had to put them in your back pocket.

Now you'll say,
"So what, you little punk?!"

So what, you little punk?!

Gotcha!

You like that?!
Don't get uppity with me!

I'm afraid you missed.

What are you punching?

It wasn't me you were pummeling
so happily.

I can predict anything your simple brain
can come up with.

Don't you get that, moron?

Please forgive my underling, madam.

You're Erina Joestar, aren't you?

I do a lot of business
with Mr. Speedwagon.

He told me all about you
in London a while back.

I'm glad to meet you.

I heard something through the grapevine

that hasn't appeared in the papers yet.

Mr. Speedwagon was killed.

Are you serious?

Rumor has it his killer
was a Tibetan monk.

A monk?

Straizo?

The bodies of Speedwagon and his team

washed up along a river in Mexico.

No one knows why they were killed
or where the monk went.

I think I might know.

It has to do with something
Speedwagon said long ago.

It must involve the stone mask and Dio.

JoJo, that guy's a mafioso!

Don't trust him! It must be a scheme!

Believe what you want.

Try your breast pocket
if you want your lighter.

Smokey, I appreciate the warning,
but I believe what he says.

These guys are only after money.

Information like that is valuable
to the Mob, so I believe it.

But!

Even if it's true, you can't just say

something like that to Granny Erina.

Do you see how you've upset her?!

You're thoughtless!

Events from 50 years ago
are coming back to haunt us.

Don't be scared, Granny.

I'm here for you.

No, Joseph. I'm scared for you!

I don't want you to get
wrapped up in this.

I'll be fine.

If it's my fate, I accept it.

I don't understand
what is going on, but...

...these two must
have an unimaginable history.

Hey, Smokey.

Chilly today, isn't it?

Take a look at this magazine.

What is it?

Do you think it can really
make them bigger?

What's this?
"Go from an AA cup to a C cup."

It's a bunch of snake oil.
Don't buy into it.

What's that?

I think $1.25 a pair is too...

Let's see...

I say.

You look kind of familiar,
yet different.

Tell me, have we met before?

Why isn't your breath steaming
when it's so cold out?

And I think I caught a glimpse
of fangs in your mouth just now.

Was I just seeing things?

Don't try to fool me.

Even out here in the streets,
JoJo, I'm taking your life!

Before your abilities grow!

You think so?

I knew he was crazy, but not this crazy!

He's right in public!

Where did he even get that
Tommy gun he's blasting away with?!

I was waiting for you, Straizo!

I don't think you'll go down so easily.

That was for Speedwagon.

This is war!

Next episode

So this is a vampire!

I'll demolish you, Straizo!

German medicine is the world's greatest!

You don't understand a thing!

Apologize in hell!

Chapter 11: Master of the GameI knew he was crazy, but not this crazy!

Straizo! What will it be?
Smashing your brain, sunlight or Hamon?

Those are the three ways to erase you.

H-He's a murderer!

Help! He'll kill us all!

JoJo, w-what have you done?!

Yeah, the repair bill
will go through the roof.

That's not it! You shot a man!

A man?

You mean Straizo?

What's going on?

The bullets I fired have
strange dents in them.

Smokey, run outside!

I hope what I shot was only a man.

If he was, time in jail
is the worst that'll happen to me.

I-I don't understand.

Calm yourselves!
I can't hear anything!

Get out now or I'll French kiss you!

From the silent depths

The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

Crimson blood

Summons the valorous to stand up

If inherited love is called fate

Then take another step with smiling eyes

Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

Destiny written into your veins

The undying bonds of honor arise

Take hold of them

Chapter 11: Master of the Game

What in the world?
So this is a vampire!

Dio's failure was overindulgence
in playing with his powers.

He wanted to experiment
with their limits.

That made an opening
for Jonathan to strike.

But my philosophy is different.

I'll find the extent of my powers
after I've destroyed you.

I'll show you no mercy!

And I'll start with the technique
that Dio used to kill Jonathan!

Out of ammo?

My eyes can fire high-pressure essence.

Face my Space Ripper
Stingy Eyes, Joseph!

JoJo!

A mere trifle.

All that is left is Erina Joestar.

And--

Now you'll say, "It will be easier than
drowning an infant."

Your next words will be, "How can
he live with a hole in his head?!"

H-How can he live
with a hole in his head?!

Too much time in a backwater
like Tibet isn't good for you.

Life in the city makes you strong.

You could've won if you were
a bit more observant.

Take a good look
at the face of that clock!

I was told my grandpa was taken down

by Dio firing something from his eyes.

A mirror?!

So you finally noticed, Straiz-oaf!

I also heard that you're as allergic
to Hamon as you are to sunlight!

I'll knock you out of the park!

Shoot!

Let's see, now. I hear
Hamon melts vampire faces.

Now we find out.

H-He's fine!

It's like nothing happened!

Was Granny wrong?

No, you would grow into a deadly foe
if left unchecked for too long.

A secret before you die.

There is an insect in Southeast Asia
called the Satiporoja beetle.

30,000 of their tiny stomachs were
dried and woven into this scarf.

It conducts Hamon far better than
the human body, dispersing it.

It's like an electrical ground.

I am the successor of 4,000 years
of history in the art of Hamon.

I know all its strengths
and weaknesses in battle.

I am not ignorant like Dio!

Wow, that's really something!

But do you think I'd rely on
gimcracks like Hamon alone?

I'm also fast!

He put a grenade in my scarf! How?!

A pitiful trick!

You should've spent time in the city!

Take a look at the grenade you
knocked away!

You son of a...!

I-I got him!

W-What the heck is he?!

Smokey, don't look!

Too late!

God, I won't do anything bad again!

I won't steal or anything else!
Just save me!

H-He's a monster.

D-Do you have a way to
beat a monster like this, JoJo?

Yeah, I do.

Really? You do?

Yeah, I have one last card up my sleeve.

One last card? W-What is it?

I saved this one for last.

Look at his legs.

They were blown to smithereens
and haven't healed yet.

That's our ticket.

A-And your last card?

I'll use my own legs.

Use your legs? How?

To hotfoot it out of here, Smokey!

Outta the way!

I can't believe this guy!

Follow me, Straizo!

Wait up, JoJo!

Even if I am immortal, it will take a
lot of energy to regenerate after that.

All right! What a scoop!
The papers will eat this up!

Here's my chance to become a reporter!

Pressure applied
by fingertips: 235 kg/cm2

Leaping ability:
Currently 4 m 22 cm

I-Is something behind me?

We should be safe now, right?

I'm afraid not, Smokey. Listen.

Listen to what?

Oh, the river?

Wrong! Look up!

H-Help!

He came after us! Run for it!

This woman is my hostage!

If you run, I'll kill her!

If you come up here, I'll let her go.

What are you thinking?

I don't even know that woman, moron!

Let's run, JoJo!

This is a test!

If you flee now, I'll know
what sort of man you are.

I need time to heal and
will not pursue you.

You would not seek revenge
for Speedwagon.

But if you come up here after the girl,

your personality will be clear to me.

You would pose a great threat
to me in the future.

I would have to eliminate you
here and now!

In five seconds, I will kill her!

Climb up or run! Decide now!

I wouldn't fight for a hag like that,
even if she was my sweetheart!

I'll kill her by pulling down
on her lower jaw.

I'll tear right through her neck
and into her chest.

Would a master of Tibetan Hamon really do

such a cruel thing to a girl?

A-A tooth! He ripped out her tooth!

That bastard! He really did it!

I'll show no mercy!

You fiend!

Straizo!

You'll pay for that!

You're inhuman to the core!

You pretend to be cool,
but you're full of fire inside.

I'll demolish you, Straizo!

Taste this!

I can beat that move now!

I won't fall for the same
tired old stunt twice!

Hamon!

Im--

"Impossible," you say?

Impossible!

I deflected your shot
with Hamon glass!

I knew you'd aim for my forehead.

It was easy to intercept.

Apologize to Speedwagon in hell!

You'll sleep soundly tonight, Granny.

Why save me from falling?

I might still have enough power
to blow your arm off.

Shut up and do it, then!
I'll just punch you with the other!

I want an answer.

Why did you throw
Speedwagon's body into the river?

Something is fishy.

Joseph, your grandfather Jonathan's
blood flows strongly in you.

Outside you are opposites,
but you're both insatiably curious.

And now I warn you that your nature has

trapped you in a fate you can't escape.

What do you mean?

Soon you'll learn of the Pillar Man.

Soon you'll meet the Pillar Man!

Don't feed me any of your nonsense!

I threw the bodies into the river
because of him.

The pillar sucked blood
from the bodies in the cave.

It was like a plant
drawing up nutrients.

It was ghastly.

So I dragged the bodies outside.

But I am sure he will awaken soon
from his 2,000-year slumber.

Joseph, you will meet him soon.

Soon you'll learn the truth of him
and meaning of evolution.

Your destiny is already written!

Hamon?!

That means you're creating Hamon
inside your own body!

I regret nothing.

I want to go to hell feeling full
and young rather than withering away.

Being young again was
a supreme joy for me!

Straizo, wait! I need to know more!

Farewell, JoJo!

JoJo...

1938, the year that the Second World War
began to engulf the planet.

The German army sought to conquer all.
Their weapons were cutting-edge.

They used astrology, sorcery,
alchemy and psychic powers.

Every tool available was employed
in their bid for world domination!

Their spy network in Mexico

Mexico

caught wind of Straizo's actions.

I-I'm terribly sorry,
Major von Stroheim!

M-My hand slipped!

Lick.

You cut me, right?
Now lick my wound clean.

Yes, sir.

Don't make it hurt. Gently, now.

Slowly, slowly.

Ahh, I think the pain
is just about gone now.

Watch out, now! Watch out!

You'll cut yourself!

Pardon me, Major von Stroheim!

The old man found on the bank
of the Rio Dada is awake.

We will question him!

Are you all right? What's your name?

Let me escort you home.

What was that for?!

How dare you call me a hag earlier?!

That punch was payback, jerk!

Did I...?

You did. Something about
not fighting for a hag.

Seriously?

Well, that's odd! But you're so pretty.

How strange!

Yowch!

You can't even remember your own words?!

You ogress...

She was too scared
to feel the pain earlier.

But I'm worried about
the Pillar Man Straizo mentioned.

Let's go to Mexico!

How are you feeling, Speedwagon?

We have a saying in Europe.

"A town where the old kill themselves
is soon to fall."

I think you hold a secret
as dangerous as that.

And it's about that man!

We obtained the pillar from the location
we extracted from you!

God, why do this to me?!
Why not let me die?!

Why did you let me live?!

You're mistaken, Speedwagon.

I am the one who made you live.

And the Wehrmacht made you talk!

Though you are old, we know that torture
would not make you talk.

You went alone and penniless into Texas.

Near dead in the desert, you found oil fields

and changed the world economy.

See?! German medicine
is the world's greatest!

It can do anything!

A truth serum?!

What more do you want from me?!

Everything! Tell us everything!

Tell us about the past!
About Straizo! About Joestar!

Tell us so we can awaken the Pillar Man!

N-No! You don't understand a thing!

He could destroy the world!

Prepare for the blood feeding experiment.

I expect perfection!

- Help us!
- I don't want to die!

I have a proposal.

Choose one from among yourselves.

We need blood for an experiment.

The lot of you must choose
who will be the one to die.

The rest of you will be released today.

I volunteer.

If I volunteer,
you'll let everyone go, right?

Excellent, young man.

Courage like yours is to be commended.

We allow only the fit to live.

Execute everyone except the boy!

Let the experiment begin!

Next episode

Don't be too proud! He's dangerous!

I've brought you some tequila.

You. Who among you disturbed my slumber?

He's in the ventilation ducts!

Chapter 12: The Pillar ManSomething isn't right.

I've felt someone's eyes
on me since this morning.

But nobody could be out here.

I'm on a motorcycle
in the middle of the open desert.

Who could be following me unseen?

There's no way.

It has to be my imagination.

You're a sharp one.

You sensed my presence, a feat even
wild bats aren't able to accomplish.

Who the hell are you
and why are you tailing me?!

I'm not tailing you!

I'm capturing you so our army
can ask about Straizo, Joseph Joestar!

S-Straizo?!

Our army?!

Chapter 12: The Pillar Man

By your face and accent,
I'd say you're German.

What do you have to do
with Straizo and Speedwagon?!

Come on!
I'll beat some answers out of you!

You face the SS commando knife of I,
Donobang, with your bare hands?

I feel insulted.

Come then, stripling!

Here! Have your flea-ridden
magic carpet back!

A-A cactus!

Victory!

You'll need to do better than that
to challenge me, you booger!

Now, my booger, say,
"I completely agree, Herr Donobang."

I-I completely agree, Herr Donobang.

What's that? I can't hear you.

You're a very nimble fellow.

I wanted to save myself some trouble
so I'm lying down here for safety.

What? You think you're safe there?

Have you lost your mind?

Wh-What's with this cactus?

Take a real close look.

The cactus was my goal all along!

Cacti are made up of 95% water
and conduct Hamon fabulously.

Now, it's time to talk, Donobang!

Tell me everything you know.

I see.

When Speedwagon's body disappeared
I had my hopes, but...

He really was safe.

Well. That's a fine piece of news.

Granny Erina will be
pleased to hear it.

But who knows how the Germans
are treating him?

I'll rescue him.

Then I'll rush home
to see Granny Erina's smile!

D-Don't leave me!

Major von Stroheim,
the pillar is cracking!

It now holds the blood
of five prisoners.

The subject's capabilities are unknown.

Feeding it too much may be dangerous.

How was the blood extracted?

No! Don't answer that! I can imagine.

Speedwagon.

Why so scared?
Aren't you overreacting a bit?

Don't be too proud! He's dangerous!

Listen to me.

That room is a bunker.

Its iron walls are 50 cm thick!

It is equipped with flamethrowers,
machine guns and time bombs.

What child fears a grizzly
in a cage at the zoo?

None at all!

I believe he's nothing more than a
cheap caveman who's lived too long!

Something's spraying out!

It's blood!

The blood it absorbed
is pouring out!

We can't see a thing!

Use the sprinkler system!

His outer layer is taking on
a flesh-like color and luster!

He's alive! He looks human!

He needs a name.

"The Pillar Man" is awkward to use.

I, Stroheim, will be his godfather!

Let me think.

I'll name him after the
Mexican sirocco! Santviento!

He's standing!

Stand up for us!

Show us what you are made of, Santviento!

Look at that! Our Santviento
is quite the comedian, isn't he?!

The ultimate organism?!
What's ultimate?!

Behold, Speedwagon!

He's sniffing around like
a man barely out of the trees!

Do you think he has much brains?

This is a farce!

Whatever. Let's say he made the masks.

You, begin the experiment.

Open the door to the next chamber.

Yes, sir!

W-What is that?!

A prisoner.
A prisoner with a mask, that is.

A-A vampire?

A few days ago, he was a feeble,
toothless old man on death's door.

We haven't fed him today,
so he must be thirsty.

He'll attack quickly.

How will they perform?
Let's watch and see!

What's this? What a surprise!

Is he just an ordinary man?

We have no other subjects to test!

Shall we use the explosives planted in

the prisoner's head, Major von Stroheim?

Major?!

Very well. Do it!

W-Wait! Belay that order!

His jaw. L-Look at his lower jaw!

A-And his arms. Look! Look at his arms!

I thought he was losing the fight,
but Santviento is absorbing the prisoner!

He is pulling him into his body.

He's eating the prisoner!

What a fantastic creature!

The masked man is his fodder!

Santviento feeds with his whole body!

T-That means he'll take in all of
his prey's energy!

He ate him! He ate the masked man!

He ate him!

A-And he's grown!

Keep your head!

Remember he's in a sealed chamber!

He only gained some weight
after feeding.

And his intelligence?

What of his intelligence?

Is he capable of thought?

S-Stroheim.

What the...?! He spoke!

H-He said my name!

But he shouldn't be able
to hear me in there!

My cactus pal Donobang said this is where
the secret underground facility is.

Speedwagon has to be in there.

Now, how to get inside?

Vegetables, canned goods, meat, ham,
eggs. That's a basket of food.

All right. Now we have to frisk you!

Don't make that face.
Smile when I frisk you!

Raise your skirts! And smile!

Go on through!

Next!

I've brought you some tequila.
Is that all right to bring through?

Put your hands up!
You twitch and we shoot!

Why? Why are you panicking?!

That's a furtive movement!

Fire!

Hold it! I-I understand! I won't move!

Damn! Y-You Germans are too smart!

You saw right through my disguise!

You're nuts! Of course we did!
What a creep!

No girl in the world is built like
such an ox, you ox!

Look at yourself
with clearer eyes, moron!

What was that?!

Hamon!

Oh, tacos!

Shoot, that was depressing.

I suppose they won't see
through an army uniform.

W-What's going on?

I-I can't tell.

Weren't you watching?

Major von Stroheim, I was
looking away for a moment.

You were here.
Everyone was here.

But nobody saw.

This is no time for refreshments!

I-It was only a moment.

I only took my eyes off of him
for a few seconds.

My vision is perfect, but I couldn't
see what was happening inside!

This is unbelievable!

The chamber is sealed!

But the subject somehow escaped!

The walls show no damage!

Listen up! Calm down and search for him!

I am sure he's just concealed
himself somewhere!

Cut off all oxygen!
We'll wait for him to come out!

The film record is ready for viewing!

Show it to us!

Yes, sir!

Begin.

He's running for the wall!

H-He couldn't be...!

He's going into the ventilation ducts!

The entrance is only
four by twenty centimeters!

But somehow he's stuffing himself
into that tiny gap!

Incredible! He didn't just
dislocate his joints!

H-He broke up his own skeleton
to twist and alter his shape!

T-That means he's somewhere
in the base's ventilation system!

The Pillar Man Santviento spoke your name
earlier, Major von Stroheim.

He must have heard your name
through the vents!

Do the vents lead here?!

Soldier! Stand away from that vent!
You're in danger!

I-It's Santviento!

Major von Stroheim,
did something happen?

It's so dark! I can't see!

Who turned out the lights?

Santviento crawled into the soldier's body!

Where is everybody?!

Don't leave me here all alone!

I'm not sure what's going on...

...but I've never felt so full of life!

What a nightmare.

If this creature escapes,
it will be a dire foe to the Fatherland!

We must destroy it!

It has to be killed here and now!

Very well! Shoot him!
Blast that soldier's body to pieces!

That tickles!

He's still alive!

I knew it!

He's immune to bullets!

What a monster!

Why is he pointing?

What's he gonna do?!

Wait! Do you think he's
making a pistol?!

Is he imitating us?

W-When he spoke, he only said my name.

He's mimicking us!

It's just mindless aping.

That means he's not intelligent at all!

If he's only as smart as a monkey,
perhaps we can still use him!

You...

Who among you disturbed my slumber?

H-He spoke!

He is capable of thought.

A-And his intelligence is great!

He has learned our speech
in this short time!

Die!

What the...?

He took a bullet we shot at him
and fired it back at us!

Hey, old man!
Hide over here!

He's still got more bullets to fire!

No! I don't need any help
from a German soldier!

Good heavens.

You never change.

Still stubborn at a time like this.

I-I can't handle this alone!

S-Stay away!

Hey, I need some of your hair!
Just a handful or two!

Yeeowch! What are you doing?!

It'll only hurt for a bit.

You're assaulting an officer!

Who are you?

That brashness... It couldn't be...!

I call this one Hamon Hair Attack!

You're... You're...!

Joseph Joestar!

Barrier up!

I think you need to start moisturizing.

If you aren't careful, you'll go bald,
Mr. German Army Man.

W-When did you get here?

Hey, old man!

Ha...ir...

Anyhow...

...what a scene I've dropped in on.

Next episode

His intelligence is incredible!

This is horrifying!

Now together, Santviento!

You primitive.

He's crawling into the wound in my leg!

Chapter 13: JoJo vs.The Ultimate BeingJoJo...

S-So you're JoJo?

Listen up, JoJo.

Santviento, the Pillar Man, uses the mask
to turn men into vampires.

He makes them stronger
so he can eat them.

He's a grave threat!
He must be destroyed!

Careful, JoJo!

Tag!

You spoke a minute ago, right?

Hello! How are you?

Happy! Fun! Nice to meet you, man!

Happy! Fun! Nice to meet you, man!

Now together, Santviento!

Three, four!

Happy! Fun! Nice to meet you, man!

Happy! Fun! Nice to meet you, man!

JoJo, stop fooling around!

JoJo, what are you doing?

Well, I have a theory that
he's not a bad guy after all.

I'm testing it out.

I think it's wrong to assume
someone is evil.

Don't be an idiot!

Look at these dead soldiers!

Nonsense! You reap what you sow!

You experimented on him
and blasted him with guns!

Besides, Speedwagon, I came here

so that I can get you back to New York.

I have no reason to fight.

Now, everyone!
Happy! Fun! Nice to meet you, man!

What's this guy's problem?
He's just ignoring me.

I'm a bit upset.

Fine. I'll just stick my foot out
and trip him!

W-What happened?

Th-That was the strangest sensation.

This is new to me.

What is this tool?

He spoke!
He really does understand!

Somehow he's mastered our language!

A-Amazing!

He's pulling it apart like
an expert watchmaker!

Soldiers need hours of drilling
in order to do that!

H-His intelligence is incredible!

So bright.

This light is also new to me.

We weren't the ones observing!

It was him watching us!

Listen here, pal!

If you can understand,
then respond!

Knock, knock!

Watch out, JoJo!

You begin to irritate me, primitive.

What the...?!

Rib Blades,
also known as Fighting Ribs.
Maximum reach: 132 cm
Maximum pressure: 825 kg/cm2

Capable of turning in
any direction!

JoJo!

Sparks?

What is this human?

My body didn't absorb his.

He flew away.

His leg also appears fine.

I have never seen such a human.

Is he a unique specimen?

Or all humans of this age the same?

It appears that human is unique.

JoJo, this is horrible!

Old man...

You bastard!

Let go of the old man!

Now I feel like fighting!

I'll have you mounted in a museum!

Humans have also evolved somewhat.

I'll flood you full of Hamon!

The Hamon is making that blood...!

It's not working!

My Hamon is running off of him like rain

from a raincoat and into that blood!

His skin is acting like a ground
just like Straizo's scarf!

My body and his body repel each other.

M-My hand...

...it's...

...it's...

...still there.

Just a little joke.

I rolled my wrist forward
in the nick of time!

But this is a serious pickle.
He's immune to Hamon!

What should I do?

No, he's not!

Hamon works! It's protecting you!

It keeps his body from eating you!

Fool! What do you do
when you eat a blowfish?

You kill it, remove
the poison parts and eat!

It will be no different for Santviento!

Well this is a perfect mess!
I have to think of something fast!

I need an escape plan at least!

Absolutely not!
You can't let Santviento get out!

He's a danger to mankind!

Shut up! Don't talk like
you didn't have a hand in this!

And you think I need more pressure?!

I'll send Hamon right into his body
through this knife!

His skin is bending like rubber!

But can you dodge this?!

Here's Hamon in your eye!

This is a surefire hit!

Wha-What?!

Even his eyes are like rubber!

No! JoJo, get out of there!

JoJo!

He won't be able to breathe after
being hit there!

He seems to create energy in
his blood through breathing.

But while unconscious,
he's an ordinary human.

JoJo! Use your Hamon breathing!

Breathe, damn it!

Use your Hamon breathing!

JoJo!

This is the end!
I have to use the self-destruct!

For the Fatherland!

For eternal glo--

Hold it, von Stroheim!

No need to panic!

I took a big gamble.

Attacks from outside are no good.

So I'll send Hamon into him
while he eats.

JoJo!

I was waiting for him to try this!

This is perfect!

Enjoy your Hamon treat!

I-I get it now.

After entering that foul body,
I understand its digestive process.

Each of his cells uses digestive fluid

to dissolve the cells of his prey.

That's why he appears to
absorb his opponents.

I'm only safe because I sent Hamon
into him as he tried to dissolve me.

But your Hamon was too weak!

It wasn't enough to destroy Santviento!

Chunks of his body
are trying to reform!

Straizo did something like this,
so I figured you would do the same!

Von Stroheim!

Pay attention!

Does sunlight hurt him?!

Y-Yes!

Joestar, it was written
on the walls of the cave!

Sunlight will hurt him!

He made the masks to conquer the sun!

What are you doing, Joestar?!

That door leads outside!

I'll destroy you with sunlight!

He's running out of breath!
He'll lose control of his Hamon!

He hasn't trained with it,
so the battle has tired him!

Cease this foolishness, primitive!

JoJo, use your Hamon breathing!

If I could breathe,
I wouldn't be so tired!

Damn it!

I've had more than enough of you!

I'm dragging you up these stairs
so you can do some sunbathing!

What the...?!

Heavy... I feel so heavy.

Wh-What's happening?

Meat Invade, also known as Foul Flesh.

Bits of Santviento are attacking!

They're draining me!

Y-You son of a...

Keep moving...

I never expected such a human
to be born while I slumbered.

Leave the rest to me,
Rudol von Stroheim!

It's just this door, right?

I believe I can handle that for you!

Von Stroheim, you...

Cursed peasants.

Just a few centimeters more!

A meaningless struggle.

This is trouble.

Joestar, could you do me a favor?

What is it?! I'm trying to think!
Be quiet!

Listen to me!

You see the axes on the wall?
Can you reach one?

Use one to chop off my leg!

Wh-What?!

Use an axe to hack off my leg!
Then I can reach the door!

B-But...

You're really asking me to do that?!

Just do it! He's starting to reform!

Don't ask me! I'm not a doctor!

I'm a proud servant of the Wehrmacht!
I am prepared to do my duty!

I would proudly give a few legs
for the sake of the Fatherland!

Do it now, Joestar!

Quit fussing!

If you want me to chop, I'll chop!

I want you to chop!

I figured he was all hot air, but when

it comes down to it, he's got real guts.

We think differently,
but I respect your courage.

Forgive me!

How do you feel now that
you're in the sun?!

Did we do it?

Wh-What?!

He's crawling into the wound in my leg!

Get out of there!

This is a shock!

Von Stroheim is safe and Hamon-free!

Santviento is inside me!

What a fearsome creature!

What tenacity to live!

If he's inside von Stroheim,
he is safe even in sunlight!

S-Such horror!

This is horrifying!

Do you know what frightens me, Joestar?

My leg doesn't hurt.
In fact, it feels quite pleasant!

Von Stroheim!

Hold on!

Y-You won't...

Joestar!

You've seen what Santviento,
the ultimate being, can do.

There is no hope for me.

I'll use this to destroy both of us.

But I must tell you something
before I die.

So listen up, you annoying Englishman.

The Wehrmacht did not awaken Santviento

because of military curiosity alone.

What?

Why so suddenly?!

Listen!

It is your destiny to hear this!

Recently the Wehrmacht discovered
another Pillar hidden in Europe!

W-What?!

Von Stroheim, are you serious?!

That means Santviento is not unique.

The Pillar Men have slept for millennia
and we seek their fantastic powers!

Soon, they will awaken.

If a weakness other than sunlight
cannot be found, all is lost.

That is why we had to
experiment on Santviento.

Events fifty years ago have
destined you to fight the Pillar Men!

Joestar, your Hamon is too weak
to overcome them!

Go to Rome! Someone awaits you there!

It is a man Speedwagon knows well!

H-He's trying to control my body
and make it hide in that well!

But soon I'll open myself up
and let the sun shine in!

Von Stroheim, you can't...

Human greatness is in proudly
facing down one's fears.

The words of the
Greek historian Plutarch.

Farewell...

...you annoying Englishman!

Don't do it! I still have questions!

Damn that crazy soldier!

Putting on a show like that...

Santviento!

Get out of my way!
If you don't, you'll die, JoJo!

Steady your breathing.
Use your Hamon breathing.

Move it! You were doomed from the start!

A-And now you'll say,
I see through you, primitive!

I see through you, primitive!

It's high noon.

The sun is above and reflecting off
the water. That'll cook you good.

Try jumping into the well after thinking
about the movement of the sun!

I'm not letting you fall into the water!

I-I'm alive thanks to the sun.

It's turned him into a solid statue!

Next episode

My grandfather died tragically.

Then you couldn't even beat a pigeon!

Bring out more UV lamps!

Awaken, my masters!

Chapter 14: Elite Ancient WarriorsRome, Italy

What do you call this?!

You expect me to eat spaghetti
with ink in it?!

Well sir, this is
spaghetti al nero di seppia.

It is made with fresh squid ink,
so it is black.

Huh?

It's quite tasty, sir.

Yum! Well isn't this a treat?

I like it! It's good!

This hotel is going to the dogs.
They'll let anyone in these days.

Signorina, this is a gift for you.

Oh, it's lovely!

My pretty thing, when you remove this

at night before bed, please think of me.

Oh, no! Did that stuck-up snob
really just say that?!

It's sweet enough to make
my teeth hurt!

I'll put a spell on it.

Make her fall to my love charm.

I can't stand guys like that!

And spread your magic to her lips.

That insinuating little dog!
I see his game!

It's a travesty!

Here we go.

A little Hamon prank.

These will wrap around his
face and stick for a while!

Th-This can't be!

I-It's Hamon!

He used Hamon!

Excuse me, you have a call from a
Mr. Speedwagon, Mr. Caesar Zeppeli.

Mamma mia! I'll be right there.

Wh-What the...!

is the Zeppeli we're here to meet?!

Chapter 14: Elite Ancient Warriors

The Speedwagon Foundation, founded 28

The Speedwagon Foundation's
Washington headquarters

years ago through Speedwagon's fortune.

It furthers science, medicine,
archaeology and more...

...for the benefit of all humankind.

But it has a deeper purpose.

To find the secrets of the stone masks!

We're using UV lights.
Put on your masks, please.

Introduce the snake!

The snake was absorbed!

Santviento isn't dead!
He's defending himself somehow!

He'll awaken in the darkness.

Impossible! How can we kill him?

He feeds on masked vampires,
and he's immortal!

But be at ease, Mr. Speedwagon.

As long as he's under these UV lights,
he won't be able to move.

That's right.

What a relief.

Let's take our time
and research a way to stop him.

These were taken in the cave where
we found Santviento.

Look carefully.

Their horns are all different!

If the one on the bottom is Santviento,
who are the others?

According to von Stroheim, the Germans
found another Pillar in Europe.

Is that true?!

They are in a vertical line.

That could indicate the ranks
of the Pillar Men.

Von Stroheim told us to meet a man in
Rome, so JoJo and I are going.

That man...

...is the grandson of Will A. Zeppeli,
Caesar Zeppeli!

So where are you from?

Shall I take a photo of you
with the fountain?

The birds in this country
sure are friendly.

Can't say I like the men, though!

Come, now! You've been introduced,
so why can't you be civil?!

Allow me to be frank, Mr. Speedwagon.

My grandfather died tragically
fifty years ago.

My father took up his torch
and hunted the mask.

We Italians have the strongest
family bonds in the world.

We are proud of tradition.
I am no different.

But what about that man?

You say he knew nothing of his
grandfather until recently!

Such irresponsibility!

I'd watch what I say, if--!

Hold on, Caesar!

I kept everything a secret from JoJo!

Even so.

He fought Straizo and
one of the Pillar Men.

So I wondered how tough he was
and waited for him.

I saw what he could do with Hamon
and was disappointed.

His Hamon is simply not enough!

His victory against the Pillar Man
was blind luck for sure.

I will never work with him!

Caesar, he hasn't trained with Hamon!

It's too late, old man.

I'll show you with a good thrashing.

That won't happen.

With your Hamon, you couldn't
even beat this girl.

Then you couldn't even beat a pigeon!

Are you making fun of me?

I love to make fun,
but I won't be made fun of!

H-He gave this girl a Hamon kiss.

I'll say it again.

You couldn't even beat this girl.

S-Should I stop them?

No, even if it's hard on him,
if he can't get through this...

What did I tell you?

My grandfather only died because
your grandfather got in his way!

I can't accept someone of
your bloodline!

Caesar, that's too far!

Y-You...

You couldn't leave it at just me,
you had to insult my dead grandfather!

I have a technique
sure to eliminate the Pillar Men.

My Hamon Bubble Launcher!

My gloves and clothing are coated
in a special soap mixture!

I'll blast you back home, Joestar!

I'm impressed you're still conscious,
but your Hamon won't break you out.

And look at that,
your breathing is ragged.

Enjoy your stay.

Now you'll say, Signorina,
I will lift my Hamon spell.

Here, signorina,
I will lift my Hamon spell.

I put a Hamon-filled pigeon in her mouth
while I was being choked.

I knew you'd kiss her again
to remove your Hamon.

I'll say it again.

You couldn't even beat a pigeon!

What a day.

Who does this jerk think he is?

Does he have to grandstand
just to sit down?

He really ticks me off.

If I had a technique like his Bubble
Launcher, he wouldn't be so proud.

I have to come up with something.

But working at it would be a hassle.

I'll show him what's what
with a card game.

What are you up to, JoJo?
Deal the cards normally.

What do you mean?

I told you to deal normally!

No tricks!

Wh-Whoa-oa!

Oh, no! I've been caught!

Well, you can't beat me without
resorting to sly gimmicks like that.

So what is this mirror
on your shoe for, eh?

You want a piece of me?!

Bring it, rube!

Caesar!

It's been eight hours.
What are you waiting for?

What am I waiting for?

Here's your answer!

What's this?! A German soldier!

It looks like we're clear.

The Germans guard the Pillar Men.

He'll get us in to see them.

You're serious?!

Germany and Italy have an alliance!

And the Germans want to do
scientific research on my Hamon.

You're Englishmen, but
you're allowed to see the Pillar Men.

You can thank my
painstaking efforts for that, JoJo.

Mr. Speedwagon, we have
many questions.

Let's work together
to stop them before they wake.

Hey, Mark.

How is your girlfriend back home?

Well, she's...

Th-The truth is...

...I'm going home
to get married next week!

Really?!

Mamma mia! Congratulations!

I was his wingman when
he picked her up!

Hey, keep your eyes on the road!

Stop nuzzling the wheel!

By the way, JoJo...

...do you have a girlfriend?

Of course not.

No girl would want to
date a guy like you.

It would be easier to find Nessie!

This guy really thinks he's hot stuff!

I'll come up with a killer technique
and teach him a thing or two!

Look! Something's strange!

Wh-What's going on?!

Calm down! They're under UV lights!
They can't move.

Take care and look into it.

Yes, sir!

The death of von Stroheim's team
was an important lesson.

We have to cut the Pillar out and
put it in a bunker in Germany.

What's happening?
There's a shadow, so I can't tell.

Take a closer look.

I-I hear something.

His horn!

H-He couldn't be...!

He's awake!

Bring out more UV lamps!

Yes, sir!

H-He's blocking the UV light
with blood and brain matter!

The world has changed while I slept.

I can see how
in these paltry inventions.

H-He spoke!

Do you think you can hold me
with your feeble lights?!

Our hands!

They're stuck together!

Wamuu!

Awaken, my masters!

The famous Mouth of Truth
was a secret entrance all this time?!

This place is so unearthly!

Caesar, have you tried Hamon
on the sleeping Pillar Men?

Hamon is only useful on the living.
It has no effect on stone.

It won't work unless they are awake.

Hey, where are the guards that
are supposed to be here?!

No one's here! It's too quiet!

You're too loud.

T-This isn't right.

There should be a guard posted here.

What?

Whoa!

Hey, I just stepped in something!

It's the grossest feeling ever!

What the heck is it?!

Th-They're...!

The husks of soldiers!

Th-They're all dead!

No way!

Hey, Dutch! Don't run off!

Something's out there!

Wh-What is that?!

This can't be! Th-They're...!

Awake!

Get out of there, Mark!

Mark!

Mark!

Caesar... Caesar!

Mark!

They didn't even notice what happened
when one of them bumped into Mark!

It's like when a man
steps on an ant while walking!

It is night outside, Wamuu.

Yes, Lord Kars. What is your plan?

Searching for the whereabouts
of the Red Stone of Aja, of course.

All we need is the Stone and
the Mask will be complete!

But Master Esidisi, the human world
has changed much over the years.

Long ago, the Emperor of Rome
had the Stone.

But that age has ended, I am sure.

Then we must find out
where the Stone has gone.

They say the Emperor
cherished the Stone.

I am sure humans
still tell stories of it.

I shall find the Stone.

We have time.

For now, let us go outside and
observe the changes in the human world.

Wamuu!

What are you doing, worm?!

Stay your hand, Esidisi!

I apologize, Lord Kars.

Wamuu, I know how you hate
when someone enters your shadow.

I forgot how you reflexively attack
anyone who does.

It has been 2,000 years, after all.

I have offended you, my lord.
Punish me as you see fit.

No, there is no reason for it.

It is that very fighting spirit
that lets me rely on you.

The fault is mine
for entering your shadow.

Forgive me, Wamuu.

Lord Kars...

We go, Wamuu.

Yes, lord.

Caesar!

Kill me! Kill me now!

Mark!

I-It's starting to hurt.

I-I'm so scared.

I was numb at first, but the pain...!

Please kill me now, Caesar!

Mark!

There's nothing we can do!

We can't do anything to help him.

We're powerless!

The hopelessness is overwhelming!

C-Caesar...

You...

Thank you, Caesar.

Mark!

He was just a young man.

Just an ordinary man.

He loved his family.

And his girl.

And his country.

He was a normal,
hardworking young man.

He was just a kid!

Caesar!

JoJo, stay out of this!

This fight is mine!

I have to do this myself!

Next episode

Oh, I'm tired of talking.

I told you to continue!

He's spineless!

The Hamon tribe.

This is my Divine Sandstorm!

Chapter 15: A Hero's ProofYou bastards!
Don't turn your backs on me!

Time to face my Hamon Bubble Launcher!

From the silent depths

The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

Crimson blood

Summons the valorous to stand up

If inherited love is called fate

Then take another step with smiling eyes

Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

Destiny written into your veins

The undying bonds of honor arise

Take hold of them

Chapter 15: A Hero's Proof

Th-This couldn't be...!

Great! He's a nuisance,
but at least his Hamon works!

You're surrounded by my bubbles.
Here's the bombardment!

H-He popped your Bubble Launcher!

Those wires on his head
didn't pop my bubbles.

It was the wind they created.

That means those wires are
anti-Hamon weapons!

They know the principles of Hamon!

- Wamuu -

They've met with Hamon before,
over 2,000 years ago!

- Esidisi -

- Kars -

What is happening
to the air around them?

No, Caesar! Get down!

Wh-What the...?

Close your eyes!

That wasn't just wind,
it was the aftermath of a vortex!

Caesar!

The Hamon tribe.

I thought we eliminated them all
2,000 years ago.

But here they are in Rome,
waiting for us to awaken.

Damn...you...

You killed my dear friend.

You think losing an eye will stop me?!

Wh-What's so damned funny?!

The Hamon tribe
always says the same thing.

It was the same when we crossed from

the western continent as it is now.

You think losing an arm
or an eye will stop me?!

How dare you take my friend's life?!

That's why we laugh.

Y-You monsters!

Let's go. We must find the Stone.

G-Get back here!

You're running away?!

Your throat and lungs are your
weak points.

We know that if you can't breathe,
you can't use Hamon.

Now I'll say what I've always said.

Come and face me again
when you are stronger, boy.

When we meet again,
I want to admire your strength...

...before I utterly destroy you.

It seems there are no other Hamon users.

Let's move.

Here! Look here!

Don't go and overlook me, now!

He only cut your eyelid.
Your eyeball is just fine.

Take your little Bubble Launcher
and hang back.

I'll take care of this.

JoJo!

It's time to show off the brand new technique

I've worked so hard on.

What?!

Let me introduce myself.

I'm Joseph Joestar,

the guy who mopped the floor with your buddy.

I call this the Hamon Clacker Volley.

I start off by filling
these clackers with Hamon.

Oh, no!

JoJo, what are you doing?!
This is no time for foolishness!

My friend just died!
You're completely senseless!

Me? I'm dead serious.

Caesar, you mourn
the loss of your friend.

I feel your pain and anger.

But more than that, I can't stand
egotistical jerks like these guys!

I'm not an expert yet, but see
what you think of my Clacker Volley!

I hate to say it, but my Hamon
is still weak.

But I can use these steel clackers to
break your skin

and fill you with Hamon.

That should even my handicap.

Pretty good, right?

Take this!

Let's go.

This is absurd.

Perhaps humans have regressed
over the years.

Regressed?

Perhaps so.

JoJo, stop monkeying around!

You just tossed metal balls at them!

JoJo might be serious. He'd be fine
if he was facing a street punk.

But these guys are
way out of his league!

It's silly enough to make me cry!

Blast it! Nobody here
takes me seriously!

Hold it, big guy!
You're gonna get hit!

Don't.

Human lives are short enough.
Do not rush to die.

Spaghetti al nero di seppia looks bad,
but it's a real treat.

You need to try my Clacker Volley
before you judge it!

The clackers vanished!

I've been working on the railroad,
All the live-long day.

L-Look!

Gotcha! Still fooled?

If you don't get it...

...let me show you!

Take this!

Those moves are impossible!

And he's even faster than Santviento!

The clackers didn't even touch him!

I admire your weapon, courage and idea.

This is becoming fun.

Thus...

I'll give you one minute.

I bestow on you a single minute
to fight the mighty Wamuu.

JoJo!

As you see, I've cut your wrist.

Your wound gives you one minute
of consciousness to stop the bleeding.

Give me everything you've got!

Here is what I say to the Hamon tribe.

Here is an hourglass
measured in blood.

Wamuu, we'll be outside.

Boy, go pick up your weapon.

Huh? What was that you said?

Go pick up your weapon?
Is that what you said?

I don't need to do that.

There's no need to go pick it up.

That was my Clacker Boomerang!

One minute is all I need to end you.

Make fun of me, will you?
I'll smash you to pieces!

Then I'll fill you with Hamon!

Very well.

Hit me all you like.

You are the first person
to scar my face.

And so I bestow upon you
this honor before you die.

You say no one has ever
hit your face before?

Big words!

You didn't even notice
when you killed Mark!

I'll make you regret
holding your nose so high!

Look out! He's up to something!
That arm of his isn't broken!

Th-This is gonna be bad!

It was wise of you to jump back.

I let you hit me to punish myself
for my lack of caution.

But that has ended.

JoJo, finish him now!

My ultimate technique.

The Divine Sandstorm!

I-I'm in trouble!

He spins his left arm clockwise!

And his right arm counterclockwise!

JoJo is caught unaware, and Wamuu's
fists seem to grow before his eyes!

The space between his fists becomes
a destructive vacuum!

The whirling creates a microcosm
of wind and sand!

H-He ripped through that marble pillar
like a piece of old cloth!

I've never seen such power!

JoJo...

That was my Divine Sandstorm.

Jo-JoJo!

No, stay back!

Mr. Speedwagon, you have to run!

I'll do something to hold him back!

The blood in my eye threw off my aim.

But it was enough, even when you
hid behind the pillar.

Dead already?

Ordinarily, I would ignore
humans like yourselves.

But you witnessed my shame,
so I must be rid of you as well.

Prepare yourselves.

I'm imagining things.

H-He couldn't be...!

U-Unbelievable. He's trying to escape!

Playing dead like that.
He's got no shame!

I can understand leaving me,
but Mr. Speedwagon?

He's spineless!

That guy is the
biggest menace I've seen!

My breathing is out of control.
I can't use Hamon!

All that's left is my specialty.

All I can do is run!

Look at our dismal hero!

JoJo is on the ground,
forced to play dead.

And he's about to
leave Speedwagon to his fate!

Even so, JoJo will remain
the worthy hero of this tale!

Here's why!

Still alive, are you?!

You coward.

You thought you could
trick me and escape?!

I only needed to fool you
for a dozen or so meters.

I just wanted to get to this minecart.

So you only acted like a coward to lure

me over and let your friends escape, eh?

And you fell for another of my tricks.

Get out of here now, old man!

Caesar, you too!

JoJo...

That chivalrous bastard...

I've sure painted myself into a corner.

I need to come up with something.

Can I get a break?

An unbending hero!

Only when JoJo loses the will to fight

will he lose his status as a hero.

JoJo!

Damn him!
He's far more injured than me!

He may put on a foolish act,
but he takes his fate seriously.

He knows he has to beat those monsters!

You speak quite brashly
for one in such a terrible state.

You're a tough one.

Weak-spirited, but tough indeed.

How are you so tough?

Do you have bricks for brains,
or do you have another trick for me?

You want to know?

Don't tell me.

Is it something stupid like going into

the mine and using explosives on me?

Oh, no! He knows!

Or do you plan to pull the brake
and send the minecart flying?

Something like this?

H-He did it again!

The time on your wristwatch
is almost up.

There is no chance you'll survive this.

You have no more tricks.

But tell me this.

Why don't I see defeat in your eyes?

You want to know?

You really want to know?

Forget it. I'll just kill you now.

If you give me a month,
I'll become strong enough to beat you.

What was that?

Give me a month and I'll outdo you.

I'm the first person to scar your face.

If I put my mind to it,
my potential is limitless.

No, never mind what I said.

Well, finish me quickly.

It's an honor to be killed
by a warrior like you.

Continue.

Oh, I'm tired of talking.

Make it painless, Wamuu.

I told you to continue!

JoJo is still okay!

You have a long life ahead of you.

You'll have to carry the shame
of being scarred by a human.

The only way to fix that is by beating

me in a fair fight after I've trained.

What? Don't feed me your lies, JoJo.

I've hooked him! Just a bit more!

He called me a coward when I ran.

Using a word like that means
he's the proud warrior type.

I can use that against him!

I'm rather new to fighting.

But if I train with Hamon for a month,

I know I have the talent to beat you!

I was the first human to hit your head,

and I carved a hunk out of it!

But you have a chance to kill me

before I grow into a real threat to you!

Why you...?!

Wamuu.

Master Esidisi.

His minute is up.
Why do you let him live?

Crap, we've got company!

Master Esidisi, I've grown fond of
this wielder of Hamon.

I-I got him!

JoJo!

I agree to your proposition.

You say you'll be stronger in a month,

so I will give you a month to live.

You won't kill me?

That's right.

We'll fight again?

That's right.

This is a bad idea. You'll regret it.

Yes! I'm safe for now!

However...

I need to ensure that
you will not simply run away.

Wamuu, will you use
that old thing again?

The Wedding Ring of Death.

I will put this ring around your aorta.

Wh-What are you doing?!

The ring will start to
dissolve in 33 days.

Inside is a virulent poison.

The ring cannot be removed.

Any attempt will break
it, releasing the poison.

You have only one way
to avoid the poison.

Fight and defeat me within 33 days

and take the antidote from my lip ring.

JoJo!

Till death do us part.
A true wedding ring.

Midnight in 33 days at the Colosseum.
I'll be waiting, JoJo.

You guessed wrong
if you thought you'd escape.

I don't imagine we'll fight,
but here's a little gift!

I'll put it around your windpipe!

My heart and throat!

Mine is a different poison from Wamuu's.

The antidote is in my nose ring.

Kars, do you want in on this?

Nonsense.

We are immortal.

A worthy opponent is a rare thing
that gives our lives meaning.

I can see why you do this.

But our goal is to obtain
the power of the Red Stone of Aja.

Do not forget that, you two.

Let's go!

JoJo, grow strong and
overcome my Divine Sandstorm!

H-Holy smokes.

A wedding ring?

That's a black joke
if I ever heard one.

And now I've got two of them.

Do I look like a bigamist or something?!

Well, at least Speedwagon
and Caesar are safe.

There's no sense in moping about it.

JoJo.

You damned fool.

Despite your blood loss, you pulled

a bluff a card sharp would be proud of.

Good show.

Let's study Hamon together.

We'll grow stronger.

You and me both.

Next episode

I only said one month as a bluff!

Step through those doors and you'll see.

Coach, no!

I won't hold back because you're a girl!

Welcome to Venice!

Chapter 16: Lisa Lisa, Hamon CoachThe poison rings in JoJo's chest and
neck cannot be surgically removed.

Before the rings dissolve
and the poison is released,

JoJo has to defeat Wamuu
and take the antidote!

Venice, Italy

What a disaster!

I only said one month as a bluff,
but they took it seriously!

I should've said one year!

Hey, JoJo...

Quit screwing around!
Start thinking!

I-I am thinking!

But there's no point
in thinking too hard about it.

Not only for me.
You'll get depressed, too, Caesar.

JoJo, you need to at least learn to do
what I am about to do.

The water isn't falling!

JoJo, catch!

Hold it like that.

That's all? Piece of cake.

Here's what went wrong.

The strength of our Hamon
is about equal.

But you always release it
in a burst from your palm.

That's why the water exploded.

But I was releasing Hamon
from the tip of my finger alone.

Just one point.

Using one point creates a vibrating skin
that holds the water.

Scattering Hamon like you do
wastes energy.

A squirt gun with a smaller hole
shoots farther. Got that, chump?

Listen, JoJo. You have to train
to control your Hamon completely.

That is why we came to Venice,
the home of my coach!

Oh, no!

The two words I hate the most are
effort and work!

31 days until the rings dissolve

From the silent depths

The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

Crimson blood

Summons the valorous to stand up

If inherited love is called fate

Then take another step with smiling eyes

Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

Destiny written into your veins

The undying bonds of honor arise

Take hold of them

Chapter 16: Lisa Lisa, Hamon Coach

What's this?

I thought Venice was a tourist town.

Why would a master of Hamon be here?

Excuse me.

We want to go to Air Suplena Island.

Gondolier, are you listening?!

He's standing on a floating oar!

W-Who the heck is this guy?!

What the...?!

You'll get it now!

I don't know who you are,
but you're going to pay for that!

You can use Hamon well enough
to stand on water, hmm?

A woman?!

C-Coach!

She is called Lisa Lisa.

No one knows her true name,

her history, or where she learned Hamon.

But she will be our coach
for the next month.

I still have to make you pay
for hitting me with that oar.

I won't hold back because you're a girl!

I tested your talents
and found them superb.

I'm impressed you can walk on water
without training.

However!

You must be prepared to die
if you want to master Hamon in a month!

S-She's made a high bar!

What the...?!

Joseph Joestar, you will wear that
breathing correction mask at all times.

I can't--

Use rhythm. With proper rhythm,
you'll have no trouble.

But if you fail to maintain rhythm,
the mask will begin to suffocate you.

You will learn to run 100 kilometers
with the mask on!

Take this stupid thing off right--

I-I can't breathe!

Your training has begun.

I'll take it off for meals
and tooth brushing.

JoJo, just maintain your rhythm.

It'll be like wearing a Halloween mask.

Y-You're gonna get it, you--

I have one more thing to tell you.

I am not teaching you
so that you can save your own skin.

I am forging warriors
that can destroy our enemies!

Y-You witch.

You want another round with her?

I don't hit women.

Now, Caesar, JoJo...

...welcome to Venice!

Sheesh.

I respect her skill with Hamon,
but I'd never marry a girl like that.

She's kinda cute, though.

Bow to her!

What? Why is a playboy like you
so polite to her?

I respect my coach like my own mother.

I won't tolerate rudeness toward her.

Air Suplena Island is 30 minutes
northeast of Venice by boat.

Compared to the city,
it is dark and mysterious.

But the island's beauty
matches Lisa Lisa perfectly.

This is our new training ground!

That entire island is my home.

We have to prepare to face death, eh?

Just how will we train?

I see.

You're safe, and so is my grandson.

I couldn't be happier.

Tell Granny about the poison rings
and I'll beat you senseless!

I can't tell her. How could I?

This is the prologue,
we call it Hell Climb Pillar!

W-What?!

What's this about?

C-Coach, are we really starting
with Hell Climb Pillar?

I haven't ever attempted it.

Hell Climb Pillar has claimed
many trainees' lives.

If you cannot overcome this test,
you have no right to be here.

Hey, don't keep this a secret
between yourselves!

What the hell is this Hell thing anyway?

Step through these doors and you'll see.

Coach, no!

Th-This is...

...oil!

It's flowing down this pillar.

It's 24 meters to the top.
Climb using only your hands.

There is no other exit.

If you can't climb,
you'll die down there.

We have to get up this slippery,
24-meter tall pillar?!

30 days until the rings dissolve

A test of endurance using Hamon,
the grueling Hell Climb Pillar!

This is bad.

I can barely cling to the pillar.

Moving my fingers even a bit
is exhausting.

Falling off of this pillar just once
would leave me

with no energy to climb!

We'd starve and die!

JoJo and I both!

JoJo, the longer it takes,
the harder it will get!

Hurry and climb!

N-No!

I have to worry about myself!

I lost control just by talking.

This is ridiculous!

I just got here!

She knows I don't have
the power to climb this bloody pillar!

Damn her! Just tossing
us down here like that!

She's lost my respect after all!

I've always been nice to girls.

But I'll come up with some way
to torture her later!

Bloody hell!

A lot of trainees died
trying to climb this thing, huh?

Are you sure they weren't simply too stupid?

Using anything but Hamon
is an insult to the pillar!

Hell Climb Pillar loves only Hamon
and rejects all else!

Never forget that!

Wait! Hold on, Lisa Lisa!

I mean, Coach!

Y-You won't really let me die down here

if I don't have the power to climb up.

It's my first day here.

This is just a test to fire me up.
You'll pull me out later, right?

Such cold eyes!

A look like that means
she'll really let me die!

Blast it all!

Who do you think you are?!

You being cute just makes me
even angrier about this!

Twenty-eight hours later.

Caesar is at 15 meters.

JoJo is at zero meters.

The rings will dissolve in 28 days.

More than a day has passed
and Caesar's only made it that far.

I shouldn't be worrying about others,
but he's struggling.

The fingers supporting him
look like they're about to come loose!

His Hamon is about to run out!

Fight, Caesar!

He's about to fall again!

He's on his fingertips!

Caesar!

W-Whoa!

W-Wait a minute.
Were his fingertips always like that?

He wasn't about to fall off at all!
He was...

A squirt gun with
a smaller hole shoots farther.

N-No way!

I-I'll give it a shot!

Let's solve a Hamon mystery!

Is this it?

I did it! I'm sticking!
My Hamon is sticking!

I thought having your hands
flat supported your weight.

It's odd, but the opposite is true!

Hamon concentrated into the fingertips
is much stronger!

What a simple puzzle! I've got it!

Now that I understand,
I just have to climb.

So how will I torture that awful woman?

Looks like JoJo's got it.

Another 24 hours have passed.

Caesar is at 18 meters.
JoJo is at 16 meters.

The rings will dissolve in 27 days!

Now I know why Caesar slowed down
so much at 18 meters.

The pillar widens out as it goes up.

This is where it gets hard.

The pillar is as mean as that woman!

Three hours later.

Caesar is at 19 meters.
JoJo is at 18 meters.

Oh? What's that?!

I-It's a crack!
And it's big enough for my fingers!

Hooray! Time for a break!

What luck!

Yes! Now I can catch my breath!

W-What was that?!

It felt like a switch!

W-What's happening?!

No!

Hell Climb Pillar loves only Hamon
and rejects all else!

Watch out! Something's coming!

Crap! I turned something on!

Even climbing this thing
might be too much.

H-How can we get past that?!

A sheet of oil shoots out at
the 20 meter point of the pillar!

The high-pressure stream
cuts like a razor!

W-What's up, Caesar?

A-Are you mad at me or something?

S-Sorry, Caesar.

But I know any sane person
would've tried to rest there.

Whoever made this was twisted
to set a trap like that!

I wasn't looking at you
with blame, JoJo.

It was worry.

Can my Hamon get me through
that razor-sharp barricade?

There's one way!

W-What the...?!

He's sticking with his feet!

Caesar!

Hamon to attract and repel!

My Hamon is focused at my feet to stick

I have to control two opposing types
of Hamon at the same time!

I-I did it!

I hate to say it, but JoJo
can't yet control two types of Hamon.

He can't get through!

S-Spectacular!

I'm glad Caesar found a way through.

But I'm not sure
I can perform a stunt like that.

Nine hours later.

Caesar reaches the top after 61 hours!

C-Coach!

JoJo can't take any more!
Stop the oil, please!

Knowing JoJo, he'll attempt
some try-or-die stunt any second now!

But will he make it?!

Hanging around like this
is getting me nowhere.

If he tries to break through,
that oil will split him right in half!

Even if he's blasted away,
he'll just fall and starve to death.

Coach!

To hell with it!

I have to try or die!

Here goes nothing!

Don't, JoJo! Just stay there!

The beat of my Hamon cuts like a knife!

JoJo!

JoJo... He...

He's using Hamon
to slide along the oil sheet!

The oil loses momentum as it shoots out.

And so!

He used the speed of the oil
to jump on top of it!

He didn't fall!
In fact, he's up three meters!

No one has ever
climbed the pillar that way before.

Turning his weakness into strength,
he's quite clever.

I-I made it!

But it's not over yet.
I'm on the wall.

But its overhang is even worse
than the pillar's.

I'm completely exhausted.

There isn't even a meter to go, damn it!

I-I can't control...

...my breathing any longer.

C-Caesar!

Don't misunderstand.

I wasn't mad at you earlier.

Coach, please forgive me
for saving JoJo like this.

That's fine, but aren't you
exhausted, too?

I forgot!

Don't let go, please!

Caesar!

Ten seconds later, after saying
Don't let go, 13 times...

...JoJo reached the top!

Hold it, Miss Lisa Lisa.

While I was clinging to the pillar
for my life, I was thinking.

How am I gonna get back at her?

Shall I strip you bare,
or pinch your nose till you cry?

I thought he was easygoing,
but I guess he's the vengeful type.

Which will it be?!

I-I did it! I'm holding water in a cup
while it's upside-down!

Marvelous!

In only three days, he's learned
how to control Hamon!

JoJo's talent is incredible, but Coach
Lisa Lisa's training is even more so!

Coach!

I-I'm impressed.
G-Give me more training, please!

You'll see. I can overcome anything!

Forget it.
I guess he's easygoing after all.

Believe me, I have many activities
ready for you.

I'll impress you into the ground.

Yes, ma'am!

The next three weeks
will be harder than this warm-up.

And who are you, sneaking up on me?

Wh-Who are these guys?

The water is like pudding!

These two are my servants and
your instructors, Meshina and Loggs.

I-I couldn't even begin to do that.

Do you want to learn?

I asked if you want to learn.

O-Of course I do!

I have to!

Do you?

Then come here
and take a good, close look.

Tell us your names already!

From here on, we're gonna...

...forge you into real men!

Breathe! If your breath is strong,
your muscles will be, too!

You have to breathe ten times a second!

T-This sucks!

Inhale for ten minutes,
then exhale for ten minutes!

If you can, the mask comes off!

Th-This is crazy!

Seven days until the rings dissolve!

Next episode

You must take a final examination.

We need more power.

He's good deep down.

This is unnatural!

I can't take it!

Chapter 17: The Deeper PlanThe spines of this mask can pierce
a human brain.

But they haven't the power
to pierce our immortal brains.

We need more power.

Oh, what's this?

It's called a Red Stone of Aja,
a rare and beautiful gem.

It refracts light billions of times,
making it strong and pure.

Its power is miraculous.

But it is not enough!

This tiny stone doesn't
give the spines enough strength.

To complete our mask,
we need a flawless Red Stone.

We need a super Aja.

Once we have it...

...we will conquer the
sun, and become the final,

perfect step in evolution.

The masks were invented by
the most intelligent among them, Kars.

Kars and the others crossed the
Atlantic in search of a super Aja.

Suzie Q.

Yes, Madam Lisa Lisa, here it is.

Thank you.

In my hand is a perfectly flawless,
natural crystal.

A super Aja!

You had a Red Stone of Aja?!

The Pillar Men wiped out
the warriors of Hamon.

But this Stone narrowly escaped them.
I am its current guardian.

Caesar, I know how you must feel.

The stone masks killed our grandparents,
along with countless others.

And we've met its inventor, Kars.

Smash it!

Smash the Red Stone!

If you break it,
they'll cry like babies.

I cannot do that.

Why not?!

There is a legend that they
cannot be defeated without the Stone.

Why the heck not?!

I don't know.

But I perform my duty as guardian.

JoJo, Caesar...

You must take a final examination.

A-A final exam?!

Caesar, you must defeat Meshina.
JoJo, you must defeat Loggs.

From the silent depths

The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

Crimson blood

Summons the valorous to stand up

If inherited love is called fate

Then take another step with smiling eyes

Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

Destiny written into your veins

The undying bonds of honor arise

Take hold of them

Chapter 17: The Deeper Plan

Are you ready, Caesar?

I'm more than ready!

It's almost dawn.

It's always darkest before dawn.

Now where on earth
is Loggs hiding?

I have to stay sharp.

I have a score to settle with him.

Is that Instructor Loggs?

H-How horrid!

I-It's unnatural!

Instructor Loggs!

H-He's dead!

E-Esidisi!

So you came to Venice, to this island.

To think that the woman guarding
the Stone is just an island over.

His lungs were pulled out.

Lungs are vital for Hamon-users.

It had to have been one swift kick.

The tyrannical Loggs.
You yelled at me for three weeks.

To be honest, I hated you.

I thought I would finally
get back at you for all you did.

But watch me from up there,
my instructor.

See the fruit of your torture!

Hey, Esidisi, it's six days early,
but I'll take it now.

The antidote in your nose ring is mine!

Out of my way.
I don't have time to deal with you.

Time? You have way more time than me!

That was sharp.
I think you've grown smarter.

But when somebody
looks at me like that...

...they're asking to die.

I'll tell you once more.
Get out of my way!

Touch me and you'll lose half your body!

Make me!

What's this?

Well? Get me out of your way!

I only move
if there's dog poo in my way.

His Hamon is breaking through my skin!

He's learned much control
in just three weeks.

However!

I must say your new skill surprises me.

But you're still far from ready
to fight against me!

I met and devoured countless
Hamon-users like you 2,000 years ago!

If I twist and break your finger off,
you'll never use it again!

Like this!

You finally noticed?

Your arm is wrapped up
in a fine silk thread.

It's soaked in vegetable oil
so it conducts Hamon well!

I was aiming for your neck,
but there was no chance!

H-How did you do it?!

I-It's...

It's a little morbid for my tastes.

First blood goes to my instructor
and me, Esidisi!

2,500 years ago, a man in China
wrote The Art of War.

He said this:

Victory is decided
before the battle is fought.

That means laying strategies
while your opponent is unaware.

I skipped school a lot.

But Granny Erina made sure
I studied history!

You may have lived a long time,
but you don't have a head for strategy!

Take this!

W-Why you...?!

Oh? Are you mad?

Are you upset that
I disintegrated your arm?

Get upset! I'm far more furious!

Because of that ring you put in me,
I haven't slept right for weeks!

I can't take it!

I just can't take it!

W-What's he doing?!

H-He's bawling!

I thought he'd blow his top for sure.
This Esidisi is full of surprises.

T-This is embarrassing.
He's throwing a tantrum!

My poor arm!

Some things are creepier
than anger.

I'll finish him quickly.

Ahh, I feel better now.

My emotions get out of control.

When I'm about to lose it,
I calm down by crying for a while.

You referred to Sun Tzu, right?

I know him, too.

Long ago, I journeyed to China.

All war is deception.
To fight is to delude.

Anger your enemies to
lure them into mistakes.

That's what you're planning, right?
I won't fall for it.

But JoJo, I really am shocked
at your improvements.

I admire your Hamon.

I've longed for a worthy opponent.

W-What are you doing to his arm?!

It's a bit thin,
but it will grow thicker in time.

H-He's too much!

He was crying a minute ago!

Oh, JoJo, I believe I've frightened you!

Admit it, you're scared of me!

I-I can't read him!

I've always read my opponents

and used their feelings against them.

But Esidisi's personality is beyond me.

Am I the one being read, here?!

W-What's happening to Loggs's body?!

I-It burns!

H-His body is boiling!

How in the...?!

An animal's temperature rises
when it moves or fights disease.

I can bring my blood to 500 degrees
and shoot it out.

I sent my boiling blood into him
when I took off his arm.

Wamuu can control the wind
with his Divine Sandstorm.

But I am a master of fire.

Heat is my domain!

Your power to utterly destroy a body
is astounding.

But I can see you're just
trying to scare me by doing it!

Try a Clacker Volley!

My Hamon isn't like it was a month ago!

I really did frighten you.

Your emotions caused you to attack
recklessly and too soon, JoJo.

My veins will inject boiling blood
into your head and turn it into stew!

This is why I am called
the Burning King!

JoJo...

Take this, Caesar!

Bubble Launcher!

Stop! That's enough!

If we continue,
one or both of us will die.

No, I hate to admit it,
but I'd be the loser.

I have trained here
ten years longer than you.

But your Hamon burned off all the hair
on my right arm.

What can I do
after being shamed like this?

You passed your final exam
with flying colors.

You're more interested in your

good-for-nothing friend's exam, Caesar?

I am only this strong because
I didn't want JoJo to outpace me.

And both of us are going to survive
our upcoming battle.

I'll say this, JoJo seems
lazy and impudent.

But he's good deep down.

You're bad at making friends,

but when you do, I guess it's true love.

T-That's...!

Esidisi!

That was a clever dodge.

T-The mask protected me, but...

H-Hot hot hot hot!

Damn his blood!

Blast it! These sexy lips
finally come out from under the mask,

and you just burned them, bastard!

JoJo, on the surface
you make witty banter.

But in your head,
you're planning, aren't you?

You turned pale, JoJo!

Did I hit the mark?
Was that a bull's-eye?!

My next plan...

I-I'll use the string!

I'll act like I'm dodging.

But I'll run a string along
these spikes while I move.

I can't let him catch on.

Once he steps inside the string,

I'll wrap him up, then use Hamon!

T-That laugh means trouble.

C-Could he be reading my plan?

No, that's impossible!

Here's the Burning King's Prison!

How long can you
keep avoiding my attacks?

So you noticed at last.

Why is my hat shrinking?

You're caught in my web!

My hat is 100% wool.
It conducts Hamon just fine.

Oho?

W-Why are you smiling?

Is there a reason?

Your next line is,
I'll wipe that smirk off your face!

I'll wipe that smirk off your face!

B-But that's my trick!

A web? Look around you!

I am the one spinning a web!

I knew about your little plan all along!

JoJo, what did you say?

Victory is decided
before the battle is fought, was it?

True, true.

True, true, true!

How very true your words were!

But my plans were the ones to go
deeper and decide victory!

My veins have given you some new holes.

Now I'll fill them all
with my burning blood.

You'll look like a lovely birthday cake
covered in candles!

He's on a knife edge!

H-He won't make it!

Caesar!

Judging from what I can see,
I assume Loggs is dead.

If JoJo falls,
Esidisi will come after us next.

JoJo's too far away for us to help now.

It hurts, but we have to think about
Lisa Lisa and the Stone.

Now, let's prepare to move.

JoJo...

Let me hear your screams
as you twitch and writhe in despair!

You laugh as I hold you
on the edge of death?

Has the fear driven you mad?

Well...

My arms are folded and
my eyes are closed.

This is a victory laugh, Esidisi.

You lost today because
you snoozed for 2,000 years.

I lost?! You say I've lost?!

Oh? You don't get it?

You can't read me?

You don't understand
you've already lost?

You said your plans went deep,
but mine went even deeper!

Humans have been progressing
for the past 2,000 years.

In the 18th and 19th centuries,
sleight of hand became entertainment.

I'm a huge fan of it.

Illusion is my thing!

B-But I cut those strings!

How are they still whole?!

My rope magic worked!

I laid my trap so that even if
the string was cut, it would be safe.

Cutting here
leaves the white string whole.

A simple trick.

Now you'll say, My veins will move
faster than your pathetic Hamon!

My veins will move faster
than your pathetic Hamon!

Feel the beat of my Hamon Overdrive!

I can't... I can't...

You're a human...

I... I-I am the highest life form!

I won't be beaten!

That's it!

You've pushed me too far!

Esidisi's body is leaking
some kind of energy!

Is it the energy from
millennia of life?

Die already!

Die with the power you stole
from thousands of innocents!

My instructor, I must thank you
for torturing me.

Grazie, Loggs!

Santviento turned to stone
and only feigned death.

But even Esidisi's bones were destroyed.
Why is he different?

Maybe it's just because my Hamon
became stronger.

He's dead now, and I have
one of the antidotes I need.

I guess it reminds me of snot
because it's dripping from a nose ring.

But I have to drink it.

All right! I think it worked.

The ring around my windpipe is gone.

So, now I'll go see
Caesar and Lisa Lisa.

I think I used my head too much.

My shoulders are sore.

Six days until
the ring around JoJo's heart dissolves.

Next episode

How about the white one?

Wait until we cross!

But I really do like this design.

I'll eradicate them.

Which to choose?

Damn it! I can't hit her!I think I used my head too much.

My shoulders are sore.

They feel so heavy.

Chapter 18: Von Stroheim's Revenge

It's dawn.

Caesar and JoJo should be back
before too long.

Madam Lisa Lisa...

Which blouse do you like?

Suzie Q, thank you.

White is always nice,
but something colorful can be fun.

I'll let you decide.

Let's see, then...

How about the white one?

But I really do like this design.

Did JoJo and Caesar
pass their final exams?

Somehow I'm worried.

I have a bad feeling.

Let's go with
the refreshing white!

Suzie Q...

Yes?

Send Caesar and JoJo to my room
when they arrive.

I'll tell them.

I really like the clean design
of this one.

Which is better?

Which to choose?

White!

Then again...

This is nice, too.

Oh, what to do?

The colorful one
will do nicely, Suzie Q.

Good choice, madam!

I'll just leave these here.

I'll clean up the broken glass later.
Be careful.

Thank you.

Hey.

Suzie Q.

What are you screaming about?!

Be quiet, dummy!

W-Who... Who are you?!

There's a stranger on the island!

You're calling me a stranger?!

It's me! Joseph Joestar!

JoJo?!

No way!

You always had a mask on before.

What a surprise!

You haven't seen my face
in all this time?

And so? Am I handsome?

Weird lips.

Even with these weird lips,
if we were to fall in love...

...you can kiss them all you like!

In your dreams!

Blech!

What's up?

Nothing.

Nothing at all.

Oh yeah, Madam Lisa Lisa wants you
to go to her room.

But she's in the bath,
so wait half an hour.

Got it. I planned to go anyway.

They know about the Stone.

You mean Madam Lisa Lisa's Stone?

Don't worry about it.
You don't want to get involved.

Um, JoJo...

Hmm?

You're actually pretty hot.

That's odd.

My shoulders have loosened up.

One ring neutralized at 6 a.m.
The other dissolves in six days.

The news I have is important,
but Lisa Lisa is taking a bath.

So I'm supposed to wait half an hour.

If I was told to wait, I'll wait.

Where to spend half an hour?

I think the best place is here
by Lisa Lisa's door.

Would it be wrong if I peeked
through the keyhole?

Nice!

Suzie Q?

What's she doing in there?

When did she go inside?

That was fast.

I thought she was on the docks.

What the...?

The knob is covered in slime.

So, Suzie Q, have JoJo and Caesar
returned yet?

Suzie Q?

Suzie Q!

Where did you put the Red Stone?!

Who are you?! Where is the Stone?!

N-No!

S-Something's inside Suzie Q!

You have reduced me to nothing
but a brain!

But I challenge you to one last fight!

I put the Stone on the boat
that just left.

I am here to stop you from chasing it!

You will not follow that postal boat!

The woman I am inside of
is still mostly alive!

You will have to kill her
in order to destroy me completely!

Can you do that?
Are you capable of that?

Esidisi!

JoJo!

You never give up, do you, Esidisi?

JoJo!

Oh, Caesar!

It's about time.

You...

You survived your bout with Esidisi?

You're a lucky one.

JoJo! What were you doing
with our coach?!

Cool it, meathead.

It's not like that. Look at Suzie Q!

Huh?

What's going on?

It's Esidisi.

His brain and blood vessels
have taken over her body!

Damn him!

Save me, Caesar!

Please...

Everyone picks on me...

...but you won't, will you, Caesar?

Don't fall for it.
She's not the one talking.

Esidisi is using her.

Caesar, the Stone is on a postal boat.

Leave this to us. Go after the Stone.

If the Stone reaches a train in Venice

we have no idea where
in the world it might go.

You're not going anywhere!

You have to kill me first, wiener heads!

A male voice!

His blood vessels are controlling her
from within!

Come on!

Bring it!

Use your Hamon and kill me!

It would be easy to destroy me
in my current state!

But you know that this girl's heart
can't take a Hamon shock like that!

Are you willing to take
this girl's life?

If you can, then hurry up and do it,
fools!

Hey!

I'm not soft, Esidisi!

I only have to end the life of one girl

and I can save the entire world.

I consider it a necessary sacrifice.

A-Are you serious, JoJo?!

Time to go to pieces, Esidisi!

N-No!

JoJo!

I'm really gonna do it!

Damn it! I can't hit her!

This bastard!

I thought he'd pop out of her,
but he's unfazed!

Enough of your bluffing.

You could never kill this girl.

The Stone has likely already
arrived on the main island.

You're too late.

A-And now...

W-What is he doing to Suzie Q now?

S-Stop this, Esidisi!

And now I will explode this girl's body,

and cover you all
with blood as hot as lava!

H-His blood is boiling hot!

S-Suzie Q's body is falling apart!

If this keeps up, it's not just Suzie Q,
we'll all be in trouble!

V-Very well.

JoJo, use your Hamon on Suzie Q!

C-Come on!

Don't make me do this!

I still have nightmares about
chopping von Stroheim's leg off!

A plan!

We need a plan!

I-I'll do it, then.

N-No, Coach! Let me do it.

W-Wait! I thought of something!

Remember Hell Climb Pillar!

We'll try that! It's do or die!

Let's go for it!

You and me! Two types of Hamon!

Two types?

I-I see.

I-It might just work.

Got it?

JoJo! Caesar!

I understand.

JoJo, follow my breathing.

Now!

JoJo creates a burst of positive Hamon!

Caesar focuses negative Hamon
on Suzie Q's heart!

At that point, the Hamon is
negative positive zero!

You've forced him out.

JoJo!

No. It's all right.

Let the sun take care of it.

That low-down scum.

Hiding away in a girl's body like that.

No, Caesar. You don't understand.

I fought with him, so I know.

He threw away his pride and did all he

could to get the Stone for his allies.

For thousands of years
he lived his life to its fullest.

Whether it was good or evil,

I respect his life.

JoJo...

Suzie Q...

While Esidisi controlled you,
you must have been semiconscious.

Answer this.

Where is the Stone headed?

Switzerland.

Saint Moritz.

A package.

An envelope with
Madam Lisa Lisa's crest.

The address is...

Switzerland?!

Are Kars and Wamuu there?

I just checked.

A cargo train for Switzerland
left ten minutes ago.

The Stone has to be on that train!

Saint Moritz
Venice

And we have to beat that train
to Saint Moritz!

In order to keep the Stone
out of the wrong hands,

we might have to do some dirty work.

We might break the law.

Some of us may end up dead.

I won't.

I wasn't ready before,
but I won't lose now.

I'll eradicate them.

Caesar!

Right. We're out of here!

Hey, Suzie Q! Look over here!

This is goodbye, Suzie Q!

But I'll be back in Venice one day!

Really?!

Yeah!

Heal those ugly wounds before then!

Later!

JoJo, you just make sure
you come back here in one piece!

Don't be pushy!

You may be an old lady first,
but I'll return!

You stupid jerk!

I'll be back soon.

Saint Moritz, Switzerland

Drive the damned car!

What's with your arms?

Something's wrong with the wheel!

Esidisi hasn't called.

He said he learned
the Stone was in Venice.

Has something happened to him?

Hey, JoJo.

JoJo!

JoJo, wake up!

5:00 p.m.
6 days until remaining ring dissolves

Huh?

JoJo, we've caught up!

They're in customs.

It's less than an hour from
the border to Saint Moritz.

I'm glad we caught up.

Look sharp, JoJo.

Listen, I'm just saving up my strength,
that's all.

Let's hurry up and get that Stone.

Then we need to plan for the
fight with Wamuu.

Wait until we cross.

What the hell?

Knock it off!

If you want to go on, just pass us!

German soldiers!

What are they doing
on the Swiss-Italian border?

You're looking rather spry.

My, how you've grown, Mr. Joestar.

W-What did you say?

What was that?

G-Get back here!

Who are you?!
I don't know any German soldiers!

Look at the train!

So many soldiers...

We found it, Colonel!

That crest! It's the package!

And we know what's inside!

The Red Stone of Aja!

W-Why do the Germans want it?!

We are taking the Stone as a specimen
for our research.

For the past three weeks,
we have been watching you in Venice.

We started when we lost
our team in Rome.

We saw your training. We saw Esidisi.

And we knew you were chasing the Stone.

Our base is a lodge up ahead.

Follow us.

We want to ask you about the Stone and Kars.

Let us work together, eh?

We are not complete strangers, JoJo.

Hey! What are you blabbing about?!

Don't think you know me, bastard!

So the Germans are here.

C-Coach?

We have no choice.

At least Kars doesn't have the Stone.

At that time, the German army
was marching across Europe.

March 13, 1938: Annexation of Austria

March 15, 1939: Annexation
of Bohemia and Moravia

They wanted to ensure their rule
was permanent.

September 28, 1939: Division
of Poland with Soviet Union

The power of the mask and Red Stone
would solve their problem perfectly.

The Germans needed the ultimate power

of immortality to conquer the world!

Five hours later - 10:00 p.m.

I'll read the heat inside.

The fireplace is lit.

Four lights on the wall,
two on the ceiling.

Two on the desk...

No, three.

Four humans standing by the wall.

From the right, their heights are
178 cm, 174 cm, 181 cm, 178 cm.

One human is by the fireplace.
He's 183 cm tall.

Five humans, all male.

One, two...

That's four.

And five.

So you're Kars?

You're fast.

In just a few hours, you heard
about your friend's defeat,

then learned that we had obtained
the Stone,

and have come for it.

And this brutal, calculated assault...

None of my men made a sound
before they died.

I'm sure there were five men
in this room.

So, why can't I sense your body heat?

Hey, rifle heads!

Do I have to wait forever for food?

Kars!

It's mechanical!

You're...

...von Stroheim!

Next episode

We should attack now!

That building is the address.

That was mean of me.

This is German science!

No machine can stop me!

Chapter 19: A Race Toward the BrinkHey, rifle heads!

Do I have to wait forever for food?

Kars!

What?

Von Stroheim!

Double shock!

This is spookier than meeting a ghost!

Kars!

And von Stroheim, who I thought
was blown to bits in Mexico.

They're both right here!

From the silent depths

The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

Crimson blood

Summons the valorous to stand up

If inherited love is called fate

Then take another step with smiling eyes

Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

Destiny written into your veins

The undying bonds of honor arise

Take hold of them

Chapter 19: A Race Toward the Brink

Kars!

And von Stroheim, too!

His hand is metal!

And his face is wrapped
in strange machinery!

The Germans are hiding
incredible medical technology.

Is it for military use?

Is that what saved you, von Stroheim?

JoJo, I've come back from hell.

S-Should I be happy?

He's not exactly a bad guy,
but he's a German soldier.

And I don't like how he struts around.

Still, I'm a bit happy.

Sit down on that sofa and watch me work.

H-He's glaring at me.

He knows I killed Esidisi!

And he hates me for it!

Even so!

Y-You think I'm gonna let you
psyche me out, Kars?!

JoJo...

Once I take the Stone...

...I'm going to end you.

Too bad Wamuu is in Greece.

I can't allow a Hamon-user
who could beat Esidisi to live.

Are you speaking as a warrior?

Or do you just want revenge, Kars?!

Over here, Kars!

I will be your final opponent!

No machine can stop me!

You think so?

Arms don't bend like that!
Both of his are mechanical?!

Now for the fun!

He's...!

His fingers squeeze at 1950 kg/cm2,
almost twice Santviento's strength!

You utter fool!

German science is the world's finest!

My arms were built based on
Santviento's abilities!

And so, Kars...

...we've calculated how much we should

reduce you to eliminate your power.

I'll pluck you like a chicken,
one square centimeter at a time!

Hey, JoJo!

Ouch!

Don't you dare feel sorry for me!

My proud new form...

...is the embodiment of the peak
of German engineering!

In other words, I am something
more than human!

Take this, Kars!

This machine gun can fire 600 rounds

per minute through 30 mm armor plating!

It'll whittle you down to size
in no time at all!

His torso is mechanical, too?!

What is that?!

Downstairs!

The Stone will be mine!

Getting it cost Esidisi his life!

I will not let his sacrifice be in vain!

That light!

The blade in his arm is glowing!

I control light!

Brilliant Bone Blade!

I-Impossible!

That blade is made of
hardened bone and skin!

It shouldn't be able to deflect bullets,
let alone slice them in half!

Why does his blade glow like that?!

Here he comes! Here he comes!
Here he comes!

T-That sound!

Up close, von Stroheim saw
and understood the blade's secret!

The edge wasn't a simple wedge!

It was moving at high speed!

Tiny, sharp claws like shark's teeth
slid along the outer edge of the blade!

Each claw refracted light, making the
blade look as though it were glowing!

We can't win!

Not with my weapons or
any modern technology.

We can't beat him!

And what was Santviento?

Nothing but a child!

He was a guard dog!
He couldn't compare to us.

Now I'll take the Stone.

K-Kars!

That ice-cold sheen!

An edge that can cut bullets!

I can't block that thing
with my bare hands!

Even with concentrated Hamon,
it would slice right through me!

To be honest, I want to run away!

He's too dangerous!

I can't think of a way around that blade!

But I can't just let him take the Stone!

If he obtained the Stone's power,
I'd never be able to beat him!

Damn it all!

I have to get Wamuu's antidote!

Kars wants to kill me!

Was this in my horoscope?!

The Stone is in this pocket.

The Red Stone of Aja!

I have waited for 4 --
No, 5,000 years for this!

And at last it is mine.

It was destined to fall into my hands.

Kars!

Wait there!

I'll kill you soon.

T-That bastard...

H-He really does hate me.

Letting him have the Stone
would mean the end!

Kars, you fool...

Don't think you've beaten me yet.

German science is the world's greatest!

Von Stroheim, you idiot!
How can you boast at a time like this?!

UV laser, activate!

The Stone!

H-Hey, it's sliding down the slope!

Damn it!

The Stone is sliding toward the cliff!

If it falls off...

W-What the...?

W-What's going on?

Kars!

JoJo, go after the Stone!

You can still grab it!

D-Dang...

He's moving so fast!

He plans to grab the Stone
and fall off the cliff!

He won't stop for the edge!

D-Damn it!

That cliff is hundreds of meters high!

Kars could survive the fall.

But it's as high as a skyscraper!
It'd be certain death for me!

He's caught up!

JoJo plans to slow down at the edge!

But not Kars!

JoJo can't win!

I won't let this slime have the Stone!

Run hard, JoJo!

JoJo, when I reach down to grab
the Stone, I'll be vulnerable.

You'll kick me then, won't you?

You'll attack me with Hamon,
even if the Stone falls.

Will that work, JoJo?

JoJo... He's...

Right on the nose!

Here's the kick you ordered!

Ah! He used his legs to pick up
the Stone by its chain!

What's with that arrogant grin?

I'm the one who should smile.

I expected as much.

A trick like that is really
not good enough.

My kick was aimed at the snow!

And it worked as a brake!

Looks like I'm the one
who made the nice catch!

Enjoy your trip!

N-No way!

A blade from the foot?!

JoJo!

JoJo!

He's falling!

T-That blade!

Kars's blade is melding with my body!

S-Son of a...!

It's 175 meters to the bottom!

Five seconds until impact!

Falling with this guy?

No thanks!

Clinging Hamon!

S-So heavy!

Hamon goes through fluids easily,
but ice and snow are solid!

However, water is slowly sliding down

the ice, so Hamon works perfectly!

That Stone will be mine!

T-That's it exactly.

That tenacity is what scares me most!

I'm best at exploiting negligence.

So a tenacious foe is the worst.

It's the opposite of negligence!

It will be mine!

More icicles!

I have to get this blade out first!

Wait, I can just send Hamon
through the blade!

Take this!

Just as I thought.

I knew you'd try using my blade.

In that case...

...into the cliff with you!

And then...

N-No!

H-He's gonna cut me!

Kars is waiting for JoJo
to rebound!

JoJo can't dodge!

I'll slice you in half
and pick up the Stone at the bottom!

You--!

Y-You won't cut this, right?

You won't chop the Stone in half
along with me!

I can use your tenacity
as a defensive measure!

Hamon kick!

Eat this, Kars!

He's using the falling icicles
as a rope!

But they're falling!

He can't reach!

In that case, I'll lend a hand!

Caesar!

Nice timing, eh, JoJo?

Since when do you two
work so well together?!

Using falling icicles as a rope?

Only JoJo would try something
that stupid.

It was predictable, that's all.

And at last you're able to think up
a stupid trick, Caesar!

W-What?!

Nice! Nice!

Very nice, Caesarino!

If Lisa Lisa is up there,
give her a message!

The Stone is safe!

I kept it from him!

That was close!

Pull him on up, Caesar.

Now, my German friend...

...your body is more durable
than even theirs are.

If you stop with the snobbery,
we can work together.

JoJo, you're a lucky one.

I'll let you hold the Stone for me
for another day.

Five days until the remaining ring dissolves.

So this is Switzerland's
famous Saint Moritz.

A winter sports hub often called
Sun Valley.

Chic, relaxed and sophisticated.

A resort the wealthy visit on holidays.

Even the cats look
they're owned by actresses.

Aren't we fussy?

Not even a glance for shrimp.

This little princess doesn't know
a thing about the world.

Well, then...

...would this smoked salmon
suit your palate?

Now, now!

I've found your preference.

Reach! Reach!

Just a bit more...

Stretch up a bit more...

Gotcha!

Oh? Did I upset you?

Enjoy, you pompous puffball!

No, no.

That was mean of me.

It's just because I'm on edge.

Five days till the ring dissolves.

Kars is serious about killing me.

I can feel the threats closing in.

I have to relax.

I'm the one always saying
that you can't mope about stuff.

JoJo, what are you doing?!

Come here and look!

Yes, ma'am!

Be right there!

That building is the address
Esidisi put on the package.

Looks like an old, closed-down hotel.

A perfect hideout for Kars
during the day.

The windows are boarded up.
No sunlight in there.

I'm sure Kars hides
there during the day.

I bet he's waiting for Wamuu.

So, what is the plan?

That's easy.

We should attack now!

I agree. Kars can't go out
during daylight.

We have the advantage.

JoJo?

I...

I disagree.

I think it's more dangerous
with the sun up.

Kars has lived for thousands of years
like this.

He won't have left himself defenseless!

Huh?!

Walking into his lair would be suicidal!

I won't go!

It'd be like a bug walking into a web!

Come on.

JoJo, this isn't like you.

Are you scared?

I'll take Sun Tzu's advice here.

Only fight when victory is assured.

I said I won't go!

Are you chickening out?!

Chickening out?

My head is cool. I'm thinking straight.

We have to wait for his move!

You want a sure victory?

Kars is alone. We are four!

We have the numbers!

We have to strike now,
before Wamuu arrives!

Caesar, you're going off half-cocked!

Keep your head. Calm down and think.

If we walk in there,
he's the one in control!

I'm not half-cocked.
I'm gonna end this!

I'll finish the fight that killed
both of our grandfathers!

I'll destroy Kars!

You'll finish it?

What about our dead grandfathers?
Who cares?

Don't drag the dead into this,
you idiot!

What did you say, JoJo?!

Family you've never met
doesn't mean crap!

Only a complete moron
would die for that!

Caesar?

Watch your mouth, JoJo!

What was that for, you--?

A sucker punch, eh?!

Oh, it's on!

What the hell, Caesar?!

Shut the hell up, JoJo!

Caesar, stop it!

You too, JoJo!

Caesar!

Y-You bastard...

Have you lost it?
You're acting like a madman!

JoJo, I thought you'd understand
inheriting a battle like this.

I was wrong!

I'm going.

Caesar, JoJo is right.
It's too dangerous.

We don't know what might be in there.

We will wait for Kars.

That's an order, Caesar.

Protecting the Stone
is our first objective.

Coach, I'm sorry.

I can't obey.

You know this is a blood issue.

It's a Zeppeli problem!

I can't leave it unsettled
while I know where Kars is!

I can't sit back
and wait for him to come!

Well?

Follow him and stop him from entering,
even if it means force.

C-Caesar...why?

Why are you so grim all of a sudden?

Why can't you wait a while?

JoJo, you've touched on
a piece of his hidden past.

You didn't mean it, but your words
hit him where he's most sensitive.

His hidden past?

W-What could it be?

Next episode

I feel like I did when I was poor!

I'll use my viciousness to destroy you!

Very well. You are worthy
of death at my hands!

Chapter 20: Young CaesarCaesar was the son of Mario Zeppeli,
the best furniture maker in Naples.

Mario was a proper Italian,
dedicated to his family.

To Caesar, he was the ideal man.

When Caesar was ten,
Mario left without a word.

They were motherless, and
distant relatives stole all they had.

Caesar became delinquent
and grew to hate his father.

I bet he's living
carefree with some woman!

I'll find and kill him!

He threw away his youth
and his future.

He committed theft, arson, assault
-- anything short of murder.

Even mafiosos feared him.

Hey, you're Caesar, right?
What's your last name?

I don't have one!

Then you aren't Italian.
Italians are proud of their families.

Never holding back, he started
fights by using a wrench.

With his foe stunned,
he finished them off!

Though he didn't know it,
he was already using Hamon.

Then, at age 16 in Rome...

No mistake. It's him!

Caesar felt he might murder his own father.

However!

W-What is that?!

That's a diamond, all right.

Boy, don't touch that stone!

You!

W-What's this wall doing?!

S-Stay back. It's a trap!

The events of 50 years ago
were unknown to Caesar.

Will, Caesar's grandfather,
had died tragically.

Mario had taken up his torch,

trained with Hamon and
discovered these ruins.

He searched the world for a way
to defeat the monsters within.

But Caesar was totally unaware of this.

Y-Young man, I ask you a favor.

Speak with a woman in Venice
named Lisa Lisa.

She is the only one who can stop them.

Perhaps because Caesar had grown,
Mario did not recognize his son.

Fa...

Caesar's father had left to keep
his children safe from all this.

Father!

Chapter 20: Young Caesar

I see.

Caesar's misunderstanding led to hatred.

But that became pride in
his father and his family.

So Caesar picked up
where his father had left off.

He wants to avenge his father.

Forgive me, Caesar.

I didn't mean to speak ill
of your family.

If you want to go in there
despite it being a trap,

then you must have a way
to beat Kars.

I've changed my mind!

If you're going in,
then I'm right behind you,

Caesar Zeppeli!

One set of footprints leads in.

W-Who was that?

I swear I saw someone.

Am I seeing things?

No, that's not an illusion!

What the hell is that!

Caesar?

He vanished!

But I know he's here.

He's within a few steps.

Does Kars have a new trick?

No, the sun is too strong.

He can't be outside!

The cat stance, an element of kung fu.

Caesar has never heard of kung fu.

But he relaxes his limbs,
ready for attack from any direction.

For him, it is a reflex.

Caesar!

What are you doing?
Going in alone is madness!

Stay back, instructor!

I can't move, let alone go inside.

Something is hiding in the entrance!

What's that?

I can't see a--

A-A single footprint.

He jumped!

He's coming from above!

I-It's...

...Wamuu!

Instructor Meshina!

What the hell? That was Wamuu.

Are he and Kars in there together?

But how can Wamuu come out
during the day?!

He does look ghostlike somehow.

Where is that smart-talking upstart?

JoJo...

I hear he's learned much.

Where is the man who killed Master Esidisi?

Wind. Wamuu can control the wind.

That's why he's transparent.

Air is coming from
those pipes in his chest.

It's slightly visible
because of water vapor.

I've got it!

He's cloaking himself in vapor
from those pipes.

It's refracting the light.

It's like a suit that bends light,
protecting him from the sun!

That's why he's transparent!

So JoJo isn't here.

You're Caesar, the bubble-user, right?

Just by looking at you,
I can see you've also learned much.

Very well. You are worthy
of death at my hands!

We'll see who dies!

I feel like I did when I was poor!

Just like when you killed my father!

I'll use my viciousness to destroy you!

Don't think your wind
will just blow my bubbles away!

Some bubbles go through wind!

I've updated
my grandfather's Hamon Cutter!

Bubble Cutter!

High speed rotation
turns the bubbles into disks!

Hamon ensures they won't pop!

The wind protecting you
is just air to them!

Instead of defending you...

...it'll suck them in!

His skill with Hamon
is more than I bargained for.

Now, Hamon-user!

Hold it! I won't let you go inside!

Gliding Bubble Cutter!

Now, while you're off balance...

...I'll give you a Hamon kick!

But Caesar was in for a shock!

If you are tripped, you try not to fall.

Especially if you need
to escape the sunlight.

But Wamuu was different!

He bent backwards!

He's not just an immortal monster!

With senses like that,
he's a fighting genius as well!

But my Bubble Cutter
must have damaged him severely.

The advantage is mine!

I have a way to beat you indoors!

My nerves are honed to a razor edge.

I can even feel differences in the air.

I have the itch like when I was poor.

My breathing is normal.
I'm not sweating.

Perfect Hamon conditions!

Instructor Meshina!

Taken off your coat, have you, Wamuu?

Caesar and Meshina aren't here!

Are they already inside?

T-That's...

What happened?

Take this, Wamuu!

Bubble Launcher!

I said that won't work!

Bubble Cutter!

Running?!

I won't run or hide!

Bubble Cutter!

You're dead, Wamuu!

Gliding Bubble Cutter!

Wamuu!

No more games!

It's over!

Divine Sand--

Stop and look around!

My Bubble Cutters are now
Bubble Lenses floating in the air!

Lenses?

And that hole you knocked in the wall

is like the open shutter of a camera!

The lenses send sunlight...

...into the hotel!

Huh?!

You can't move!

You're film! A frozen image!

You're totally exposed!

Trying your barrier again?

I won't let you!

I'll finish you off
with a direct Hamon blast!

One point...

...at one moment.

A tiny blind spot.

Caesar's body created a shadow
at one point!

Wamuu didn't lose his chance!

He showed Caesar once again
that he was a fighting genius!

Wind power!
Divine Sandstorm!

S-Such destruction!

I-It couldn't be!

It's Wamuu's Divine Sandstorm!

So that means Caesar is...!

You had grown so much.

I am satisfied.

I haven't had such a fight in ages...

...warrior of Hamon.

And it was a close one, too.

If my wind didn't have the strength
to blow away your lenses...

...I have no idea how I could've
stopped the light.

And if Lord Kars, who cannot use wind,
had met you here first...

...and met your power...

Even if he had won...

...he would've been in worse shape
than I am now.

Don't.

You will not fight again.

My Divine Sandstorm
has shredded your body.

Stop. The battle is done.

You have no more Hamon.

See?

You've almost bled out.

That means you have no hope.

Stop.

Goodbye.

Your life has ended.

What?!

My lip ring with the antidote. Why?

I-I'm...not afraid to die.

But I am a proud member
of the Zeppeli family.

It is in my blood.

Something like this might mean nothing

to an inhuman monster like you.

My father didn't recognize me,

but he sacrificed his life to save mine.

My grandfather gave his Hamon energy

to JoJo's grandfather before he died.

It's tradition. I have to do something.

I can't let my life's flame sputter out.

This is the Zeppeli family spirit,
from the past to the future!

It's the human spirit!

JoJo, this is the last of my Hamon!

Take it!

That's Caesar!

Did you hear that?

Yes.

Caesar can't be...!

Caesar!

He made a bubble from his blood.

He must have used
all of his Hamon to make it.

He saved it for this, for his friends,
rather than using it on me.

I'll let it go.

It's not because I'm sentimental.

His talent as a fighter was real.

He has my respect as a fellow warrior.

I will hold you forever
in my memory...Caesar.

A man as splendid
and as fleeting as a bubble.

T-The place is a wreck.

A Divine Sandstorm did this.

And Caesar was caught in it.

A bubble...

C-Could it be...?

No!

It's Caesar's bandana!

And...

A ring! Wamuu's lip ring!

This Hamon energy feels strange!

W-Whoa!

I haven't called Caesar's name
since we got here.

It was because I was scared.

If I cried out his name
and there was no response...

If there was only silence...
That's what scared me.

I wouldn't accept it.

So I didn't call him.

But now I know.

The Hamon in that bubble
told me everything.

Right here, moments ago...

...Caesar died.

Caesar, you bastard.
You were a showoff till the end.

Leaving a gift like this...

Caesar, where are you?!

Where are you sleeping?!

I'll find you! I'll dig you up! Caesar!

JoJo!

This isn't the time to search or grieve.

What?!

There are two of them and two of us.
Even numbers.

But all that trail of blood says
Caesar hurt Wamuu badly.

We're in enemy territory.

Let's go and finish it.

JoJo, come on.

Take the antidote, then we'll hunt them.

T-That heartless...

Not even a single tear for Caesar?!

Coach Lisa Lisa...

...your cigarette's backwards.

She's our coach,
she has to keep a cool exterior.

I know she wants to cry
much more than I do.

He treated her like a goddess,

and knew her much longer than me.

I have to hold my feelings back.

Caesar, I know you thought
I was self-centered.

But sometimes I understand
how others feel.

I might be learning.

But I'll fight them like the devil!

Your spirit rests with me!

Blood...

It's blood.

That's where Caesar fell.

Caesar...

Caesar...

Caesar!

They're in enemy territory.
Kars and Wamuu are near.

But the two couldn't help themselves.

JoJo called Caesar's name.

Lisa Lisa's tears flowed freely.

But their cries were only answered
by cold silence.

Caesar was gone.

The silence confirmed the fears
of JoJo and Lisa Lisa.

Though his body had died,
his soul lived on.

Rest in peace, Caesar Zeppeli.

Next episode

I'm in a bad mood.

I'll hug you to death!

We fight tonight, under the full moon.

You have no tomorrow.

Fight alongside me, Caesar!

Chapter 21: A Hundred Against TwoThis building was originally
a 14th-century castle.

It was converted into a hotel
in the early 1900s.

But it closed 10 years ago
when its owner died.

Now Kars has turned it into a shelter
from the sun.

The enemy lurks within.

But JoJo and Lisa Lisa
know nothing of the hotel's layout.

Chapter 21: A Hundred Against Two

Damn it!

What's with the creepy cobwebs?

Clean the place!

We're depressed enough
without these decorations!

But look at this trail of blood.

Wamuu took a heavy beating from Hamon.

Caesar didn't go down without a fight.

We can't let Wamuu recover!

We're going in, Coach Lisa Lisa!

What is it?

W-Well...

T-This doorknob really grossed me out.

It feels like
I'm grabbing some guy's hand.

I'm not a door!

Huh?!

What are you looking for?
I said I'm not a door.

A vampire!

Look out, JoJo!

JoJo!

If it weren't for that weapon,
I'd have peeled your face clean off!

I'm Wired Beck.

I killed my lover,
but escaped from prison.

But then Lord Kars made me
part of his gang with a mask.

He has my loyalty.

I'm not going to let you go in
and disturb Lord Kars's rest.

Those fiends! So they're already
unleashing their hounds upon humans?!

How troublesome.

You're just a pawn
that's bound for hell.

Here, let me give you a little push
into the abyss!

Lisa Lisa?

Beautiful! Magnificent!
Such lovely skin you have!

Hold me! Let me drink your life
through that skin!

I'm in a bad mood.

I don't want to hear from
or look at a worm like you.

But if you want to hold me, just try.

It'll be the last thing you do.

Spikes!

So that's what they are!

They're spikes, not fingers!

He's covered in wire-like body hair!

I don't like it when women
make jokes about me.

Girls who laugh at me get punished!

I'll give you a squeeze!

I'll hug you to death!

Yikes! He's faster than I thought!

Her scarf!

I see. Her scarf
becomes a Hamon-filled weapon.

A scarf?

You want to catch me?

Don't make me laugh!

And now I'm free!

Uh... Wha...?

Where are you going?

Come, JoJo. Let's move.

O-Okay.

Lisa Lisa's movements flow like silk.

She doesn't waste any effort!

Hey, don't ignore me!

Hey, you!

A woman like that
has to be punished, right?

Oh, no, friend. Your time is up.

You're the one who got punished.

You got a dose of Hamon.

Don't be ridiculous!

She's got what it takes!

I thought she'd be weak in a fight,
but she's better than me!

I'm impressed!

She's my coach, after all!

By the way, JoJo...

...you still haven't taken the antidote
Caesar stole for you, eh?

This?

Why?

I'll drink it after I beat Wamuu.

This ring isn't a promise between
Wamuu and me anymore.

It's now a promise to Caesar
to fight and keep living.

Lisa Lisa, will you hold it for me
until I need it?

No.

You should keep it.

Who knows what may happen to me?

As they went deeper,
the trail of blood grew ever thinner.

JoJo and Lisa Lisa were fully aware
what that meant.

Wamuu's wounds were healing.

Are they here?

I've been waiting.

You've grown quite a lot.

Bastard, you killed Caesar!

Calm down, JoJo. Look at the floor.

Don't worry, my head is cool.

I noticed, too. The footprints, right?

There are two sets.

That means Kars is here! Where is he?!

Show yourself!

Yes. Two sets of footprints.

But I feel dozens of lungs breathing.

It's her. I see...

You're quite composed and
perceptive for a woman.

I can see how JoJo and Caesar
learned so much so quickly.

And you can feel even slight breathing.

You're among the finest Hamon warriors.

Wha-What the...?!

You, you're all vampires, aren't you?
Damn it!

No response? That's creepy.

Kars!

Lord Kars gave us, his chosen,
eternal life!

It's 100 against two!

When our master gives the order,
we'll tear you both to shreds, JoJo!

T-This is bad. It's 100 on two.

Lisa Lisa, we can't win this one!

Wait, Lord Kars.

Back in Rome, we promised
to fight each other.

I want revenge for Master Esidisi.

Please allow me to fight.

I shall not.

Our goal is to obtain
the Red Stone of Aja.

Don't forget that, Wamuu.

Yes, lord.

That's right. We can't.
I'm not in the mood anymore.

I know I could beat you.

But even if I did,
all these vampires are still here.

Win or lose, I'd still die, right?

With odds like that,
giving up is only natural.

I'm throwing in the towel.

Blast it! You all saw, didn't you?

And I thought I could
zap them all at once, too.

Now, kill them!

If you kill us,
you'll never have the Stone.

Hold!

What's this, woman?

I'm not stupid enough
to be carrying the Stone here.

If one of us isn't
in a certain place at a certain time...

...the Stone will be destroyed!

Don't try to fool me, woman.

Do you think
you'll be able to find it in time?

The bomb is a small thing,
but is enough to damage the Stone.

Is all this true? She never told me.

I'll just run with it!

Yeah, it's all true!

If we die, boom! Kaboom!

Even so, we can't let you
leave here alive.

I have a suggestion.

JoJo and Wamuu can fight one-on-one.

And Kars,
you and I will fight one-on-one.

And to the winner...goes the Stone!

What?!

The victor will win the Stone
and the future.

It will all be clear.

Who will hold the stone, us or you?

Who will survive?
The Pillar Men or humankind?

Why you...!

Wamuu?

It's laughable, Lord Kars.

S-She's good!

She's a better gambler
than I could even dream of being.

You've got pluck, woman.

Very well. We fight for the Stone.

But don't get cocky!

You have no tomorrow!

She just turned a dire situation
into more-or-less even odds.

All right, then. Let's do it!

We need a proper time and place
for our battle.

Wamuu, your thoughts?

We fight tonight, under the full moon!

The place will be at the foot of
Piz Berlina, 15 km southeast of here.

We meet at the Skeleton's Heel
stone circle.

Many warriors found death
or glory in that place.

A stone circle?

Hey, you can't just pick a place
that suits your fancy!

Wamuu, I think that's a fine choice.

Now, about the Stone...

JoJo!

Bring the Stone to the Skeleton's Heel
at midnight tonight.

And be sure to remove the bomb.

The woman stays here as insurance!

Lisa Lisa!

They don't want us to run.

It's a reasonable request.
Go and fetch the Stone.

Don't worry about me.

Right. I'll see you at the arena.

Trust me.

I do.

Caesar...

Until yesterday,
I lived only thinking of myself.

But a new feeling burns inside me now.

Is this compassion?

Curse it!
I just want to wreck those bastards!

And I'll do it for Caesar, Meshina,
Lisa Lisa and the rest!

I'll fight for you all!

As I thought, there's no bomb at all.

Lisa Lisa, you're deceptive,
even under pressure!

Now, maybe I should bring you
a change of panties, hmm?

What're these photos?

It's Granny Erina!

Why would Lisa Lisa have this?

Who are these people?

May 1889?

It's 50 years old!

This young man is Speedwagon!

Granny Erina!

And Straizo is holding a baby!

Lisa Lisa... I know nothing about
her life or her past.

Why does she have these photos?

It's the real thing.

We accept your bargain.

We'll fight you one-on-one!

You saw the photos.
That means you want to talk, right?

Actually, I had planned to talk to you.

Just who are you?

Fifty years ago...

Erina lost her husband, Jonathan Joestar
on a ship on the Atlantic.

He was your grandfather.

That day, your grandmother
saved a baby girl's life.

That was me.

The baby in that picture is me.

H-Hang on now.

That was 50 years ago!

If you were a baby 50 years ago...

H-Hey! How old are you, anyway?!

Y-You're 50?!

I-If you're 50, that means...

...y-you're old!

Right? Normally...

Y-You look like you're in your late 20s.

They say Hamon energy is life energy
and keeps you young.

But I guess you don't behave
like a young woman should at all.

I think I see a wrinkle
behind those shades!

Just kidding.

Now, prepare the arena!

Light the fires!

There's no time to talk now.

But we do need to.

My roots are connected to yours.

Our roots?

The mask killed my parents.

Since Erina was pregnant
when she rescued me...

...I was raised by Straizo.

A-Are you serious? By Straizo?

Straizo taught me about Hamon.

Straizo gave me the Red Stone.

So S-Straizo is your foster father!

It is tragic that the fear of aging
drove him to such madness.

My feelings about you defeating him
are complicated.

But I feel it was destiny.

What can I say?

I-It is very complicated.

What a bizarre relationship.

Lisa Lisa carries
a past full of sadness.

JoJo, we're out of time.

W-What's the rumbling?

They're here. Now the battle can begin.

T-They're...!

Out of the way!
I don't care if you get crushed!

I-Is that a d-dinosaur?!

N-No, it's a horse!

Lord Kars, Lord Wamuu, please move!

They've gone berserk!

Lord Wamuu, please!

What fine steeds.

We used masks
to turn these horses into vampires.

V-Vampire horses?!

In this arena, JoJo will face Wamuu
in an ancient-style chariot duel!

A chariot duel?!

An ancient Roman death match!

You'll ride through the arena
while you fight!

Lord Wamuu or JoJo? Who will fall
or be beaten down while riding?

Defeat means death!

Those are the rules, JoJo!

The beasts have 150 horsepower!

Even Lord Wamuu can barely control them.

Now wait a minute!

I'll fight you on any field!

But vampire horses
are your minions, right?!

Worry not. The reins conduct Hamon.

Wamuu will use his strength.

You can use Hamon to control them.

I-Is that right? They look vicious!

Don't bite, now!

I see. A little Hamon does it.

Wamuu! Wamuu! Wamuu!

Wamuu chose an ancient form
for this battle.

That means he's serious.

He's not doing this for fun,
or making sport of it.

Beat him, JoJo. We have to win this.

There are no draws!

Wamuu!

I haven't taken this antidote yet!

I promised Caesar I'd drink it
after I kill you!

That promise will give me
power I've never seen before!

Fight alongside me, Caesar!

I ride to battle!

Next episode

Wamuu! Wamuu!

Start!

Chapter 22: A True WarriorThe battle for the Red Stone!

JoJo versus Wamuu...

...in a chariot duel!

The match will begin when the moon
reappears from behind that cloud!

What a life I have.

Why does Wamuu get all the fans?

One lap is 960 meters.

These horses can make a lap
in one minute.

Look at that column.

Each lap, a new weapon
will hang from that column.

Weapons?

The one who reaches the column first

will be able to wield that weapon.

For the first lap...

...it's a giant sledgehammer!

That thing could smash
through a chariot!

If Wamuu gets his hands on it,
my situation will go from bad to worse!

But if I get it first, cover it with oil
and fill it with Hamon...

...victory will be mine!

I expect an excellent,
fulfilling fight from you, JoJo.

The moon is at the cloud's edge.
Soon its light will shine upon us!

JoJo, what are you doing?!

It's almost time!

I know, I know!

The start is the key!

I have to check the rubble
under my wheels.

Hey, Wamuu, it looks pretty bad down there.

You gonna clear that up?

JoJo, hurry and climb on!

JoJo!

Start!

From the silent depths

The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

Crimson blood

Summons the valorous to stand up

If inherited love is called fate

Then take another step with smiling eyes

Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

Destiny written into your veins

The undying bonds of honor arise

Take hold of them

Chapter 22: A True Warrior

Start!

What the...?

L-Lord Wamuu is having trouble starting!

His wheels are stuck!

JoJo did it!

That clever devil.

Bastard, you were at work
while we looked up at the moon!

You cheater!

Rotten cheater!

I never thought I'd be called
a cheater by you!

When your life's on the line,
there are no rules!

I don't mess around
when it comes to survival!

Beep beep!

He's nearing the column!

JoJo will reach the hammer first.

Mine! Mine! Mine!

Wait till I get my mitts on you!

Gotcha!

I'm going faster than I thought!

No!

JoJo!

Y-Yikes! It got caught on my ring!

B-But now this fight is in the bag!

What luck!

You can have the hammer.

That was my plan from the beginning.

Wamuu has some sort of plan.

Show me your fighting genius!

A little oil and some Hamon!

Bring it on, Wamuu!

Wamuu slowed down.

This is a fight to the death,
not a race.

The proper usage of your weapon
and your horses is the key.

Okay! Now I'll just move in and
whack him with my hammer!

JoJo, you can't slow down now!

You have the hammer,
so I'll grab something else.

So, Wamuu, are you ready
to get slammed by this thing?!

He was so happy with his hammer,
but now look at his face!

H-He sure thinks b-bigger than I do!

No! Speed up and get away, JoJo!

Too late!

Now you have to abandon your chariot!

He fell? I guess the fight ends early.

What will JoJo do next?

JoJo!

I give a 90% chance he'll be crushed
by my vampire horses.

There's a 5% chance he'll break left...

...and a 5% chance he'll go right.

Now what will our cunning warrior do?

M-My hammer.

Where's my hammer?!

His hammer? Did he hit his head?

A hammer won't save you now!

He mustn't dodge.

If he does, Wamuu will stop and finish him

with a Divine Sandstorm!

But JoJo ran straight at Wamuu's horses!

Yes, JoJo! Quick thinking! That'll work!

He struck the harness
between the horses!

The horses ran on, and JoJo used
the hammer to send himself skyward!

U-Unbelievable!

The hammer's length
kept him from being kicked!

In your face!

And now to give you a good whack!

He's gone! Where'd he go?!

Wamuu is always a step ahead of JoJo.

R-Right! These guys can hide
inside others!

That was close!

H-His boot!

It saved him!

If he wore a different kind of shoe...

Luck's on my side!

This hammer got caught on my ring.

Luck is part of being effective!

Now look at yourself!

Your own power has trapped you
inside of that horse!

Here we go!

Here's Hamon for you
and your horse, Wamuu!

The fool! He doesn't see!

Look out, JoJo! Stay away from Wamuu!

Inside there, Wamuu's hands are free,

and speed and shaking are no issue.

That means...

Nobody has survived a direct hit!
Caesar didn't!

You are caught in my Divine Sandstorm!

Even with just half a lap
around the arena,

it was a fight full of twists, eh?

But in the end, Wamuu was the better
thinker and the better fighter.

Next up is the battle
between you and me.

To be honest,
I prefer not to fight women.

Wamuu dislikes it even more.

Even so, all Hamon-users
must be exterminated.

Drink that for a painless death.

You seem to be mistaken.

JoJo and Wamuu aren't done fighting.

L-Lord Kars, look over there!

Huh?!

Lord Wamuu's arms look like
they're about to fall off!

M-Madness...

How did that happen?

W-Wamuu! What happened to him?!

It's JoJo!

He survived! He's up!

He's just fine!

W-Well, I did it again.

That Divine Sandstorm hit him directly!

H-How...?

Directly?

JoJo was cunning enough to make
it look direct.

He's an absolute genius of trickery.

I don't know if I should praise him.

Take a closer look at Wamuu.

I-I see...

He wrapped Hamon-filled reins
around Wamuu's arms.

Wamuu's Divine Sandstorm was hobbled.

Wamuu was sticking his hand
out of the horse.

I knew he'd stick his other hand out
to use his Divine Sandstorm.

And I had the perfect counter!

Look at Lord Wamuu's face!

He's sweaty and pale!

Where is he looking? He looks vacant!

W-What should we do?!

It's lap two!

B-But Lord Wamuu can't grab
a weapon like that!

Can Lord Wamuu fight on?

It's no surprise.

Wamuu was struck with Hamon
in the middle of his attack.

The confidence he built over millennia
has crumbled.

The quiet intensity his victories
gave him has vanished.

It was surely a shock for him.

But it matters not!
Put out the next set of weapons!

Lord Kars gave the order!

We must obey his command.

For the second lap
both warriors get crossbows!

Each comes with two balls for ammo!

The faster warrior chooses
the large or small bow!

S-So now there's two weapons,
a big one and a small one?

Lisa Lisa, let me say
what's on your mind.

Wamuu's mind is in no state to fight.

So why is Kars deploying weapons
with such confidence?

It makes you nervous, right?

Here's why.

It's because Wamuu is a true warrior.

Top athletes use a psychological
technique called the switch comeback.

When pressured by shock, failure or fear

they can flip a mental switch
and bring out their fighting spirit.

In desperate situations,
a ritual is needed.

This is Wamuu's!

W-What the...?! What is he doing?!

Lord Wamuu!

Look at his eyes!

He poked them out!

I foolishly relied on my eyes
because I could see.

JoJo exploited my weakness.

Now I will use this horn
to see wind instead of light!

He flipped his switch
by removing his eyes.

Wamuu is now psychologically invincible.

Now he can sense the wind with his horn.

He sees air better than light.

W-What was that all about?

That won't psyche me out!

We lost Caesar!

Your eyes are nothing compared to that!

Which crossbow--

--will you take?

Why ask? You know the answer!

The big one, of course!
I need more power!

That one does have power.

Yeah, lots of power.

N-No! I can't draw this thing!

S-So tight! Can I even bend this string?

You got greedy!

Even a normal crossbow
takes a lot of strength to draw!

You got greedy!

So greed got you back!

I'll use the first ball
to get a picture.

Now I see the range.
The next shot won't miss.

Damn. How can I shoot back?!

Lord Wamuu, blow him to smithereens!

Let us feed on whatever remains!

J-Just as I thought.

The wind stirred up by the fire
makes it hard for him to see.

This is the spot!

He's underestimating Wamuu.

H-Hey, what's Lord Wamuu doing?

He's turned away from the flame!

JoJo is staying opposite Wamuu
and near the flame.

He's giving away his position!

He's banking his shot
like a billiard ball!

Wha...?!

He hit me from behind!

I was looking at the terrain
as we circled.

I wanted to find a wall
I could use on you!

C-Can't breathe!

It lost momentum,
so it didn't pierce the skin.

But he's spitting up blood,
which means organ damage.

Finish him, Wamuu!

But JoJo is a wily one.

Be on your guard!

Has he set a trap?

My crossbow cocked itself
when it hit the ground.

I can't let him know that!

I can't kill him from this far.

Closer. Come closer.

N-Now!

He has!

Almost! Almost!

His shot went wild, though.

I should commend him for fighting
until the very last.

Here I come, JoJo!

S-Stay away!

D-Don't get any closer!

Go away! Leave me alone!

Please, just spare me!

You cur!

Huh?

He's throwing rocks!

What a pathetic loser!

Go down like a man, little worm!

Wamuu...

...here's what you'll say next.

Do not dishonor our fight, JoJo!

Do not dishonor our fight, JoJo!

Here!

A bat could fly between those stones.
But what about you, Wamuu?

A-An iron ball c-came from behind!

B-Bastard!

Looks like I did it again.

Wamuu, I used the shot you fired
at me earlier.

The arena went quiet.

Everyone was silent.

There wasn't even a moan.

Wamuu's wound was
like a Jack-o'-Lantern's sneering grin.

The iron ball carried
a small amount of Hamon.

The wound began to fester.

Wamuu's damaged arms grew worse.

There would be no more
Divine Sandstorms.

I-I have to r-resume my Hamon breathing.

A kick after faking a fall?!

You're just lashing out in pain!

Rebuff Overdrive!

JoJo won! Wamuu won't get up again!

W-What has become of the great Wamuu?

I have fallen into such a sorry state.

A body that lived for 12,000 years
is reduced to this.

H-His arms!

His arms are gone!

It is not my way to give the enemy
an easy victory.

My wounds are my flesh.
My losses are my ability.

I will use all of this to claim victory!

His arms!

He fired his severed forearms
from the hole in his chest!

What the...?!

C-Can't breathe!
I can't use my Hamon breathing!

T-That wind.

It's flowing toward Wamuu.

This is my ultimate mastery of wind.

Ultimate mastery? No!

Stop, Wamuu! You cannot do that!

The wind is going into those pipes!

My ultimate mastery:
Atmospheric Rift!

Next episode

You recreants!

No matter what the method...

Kars's stance...

You crossed a line
you shouldn't have crossed.

I alone always stand on top!

Chapter 23: The Warrior of Wind

T-That wind...
It's flowing toward Wamuu.

My ultimate mastery:
Atmospheric Rift!

T-That's wind?!

You're near the flame,

so I only know your
approximate location.

But now that you can't use Hamon,
I'll find you eventually...

...and cut you down.

Atmospheric Rift
is Wamuu's final weapon.

The pipes he uses to cloak himself
suck up huge amounts of air

and then compress it.

The air is then blasted out of
a paper-thin slit.

It is a razor made of wind.

But it creates a terrible amount of
heat and friction, even for Wamuu.

His body can't handle it,
so it's falling apart.

But that tragic figure
is truly breathtaking.

Victory is yours!
Take his life to salve your wounds!

JoJo!

I-It's close!

I'll have to use one of my tricks!

This one's called the Hamon oil trick!

His lungs are like
high-pressure oxygen tanks.

Those pipes...

If I can hit them...

...he'll suck in the flames and explode!

But this is the last ace up my sleeve.

If I mess this up...

I've got you now!

Blast it!

Take this, Wamuu!

A firebomb?

Pathetic.

I can sense things
that are away from the flames.

You're out of tricks.

And that cry gave away your position.

Now...

Atmospheric Rift!

Caesar!

Lend me your aid!

More fire?

I can sense things away from the flames.

And now I will cut you in half
to claim my victory.

JoJo!

H-He's finally won it.

Wamuu...

You lost the moment
I threw Caesar's bandana.

Don't you see I meant for you
to break the bottle?

Your ability to cut it so easily
led to your defeat.

The oil that was inside is now vapor.

And the bandana you sliced up?

The fire...

...it's still burning.

And I'm sucking it in!

Wamuu...

You were an admirable fighter.

But a powerful ally named Caesar
was with me this whole time.

H-He lost.

He lost!

Lord Wamuu!

JoJo, that creature can regenerate,
even after exploding like that.

Use your strongest Hamon
to finish him completely!

S-So it's finally over, Jo...Jo...

It is.

You paid me back for Caesar.

I did.

Then do it.

Finish me.

I will!

W-What is this?!

That smoke isn't from the explosion.

It's from your wounds.

The Hamon from your limbs
spread throughout your body.

I know how painful that must be
for your kind.

I cannot mend you.

But my blood can ease
your pain before you go.

Do you wish to shame me as I die?

Stop! I don't need your pity!

Pity?

Did you say pity?

So why did you ignore the bubble

that carried Caesar's bandana and this ring?

Was it pity?

It was because that man
was a proud warrior.

I wished to honor him.

No, JoJo, you don't...

No, JoJo, you don't...

I do, Wamuu.

A fight is a fight.

My grief for Caesar is my grief.

Somehow, I wanted to honor you in return.

My blood pays tribute to you.

I have lost, JoJo.

It seems that as a warrior,
you stand taller than I did.

Kill the bastard!

Hold!

What betrayal is this?!

What?!

You recreants!

Wamuu!

W-Why?

I am sworn to Lord Kars, but I will

not allow the vampires to attack you.

I told Caesar this as well.

It's not because I am sentimental.

To me, only the strong are real.

Victory alone is just and admirable.

I merely lived according
to my own code of honor.

To me, immortality was a trivial thing.

All that mattered
was living up to my code.

Now...

Drink the antidote for me.

Do it before I fade.

Will you see?

I don't need eyes, a horn, or words.

I will know.

The action is what matters.

I have no regrets.

I am glad I was able
to witness your growth.

Perhaps I lived these thousands
of years in order to

meet you at the end.

Fare...well...

Jo...Jo...

Wamuu merged into the wind.

JoJo immediately gave
his opponent a last salute.

Though he shed no tears,
they had shared a silent song.

They had shared an affinity.

Wamuu, kill him.

B-But Lord Kars...

With respect, he's only a boy.

A boy? That he is.

That's why he must die.

If these Hamon-users grow up,
they'll be deadly enemies.

And humans grow quite rapidly.

Can you do it, Wamuu?

Well, since you can't do it yourself...

...let me show you how.

This is how it's done, Wamuu!

Wamuu...

He was too pure a warrior.

That purity made him weak!

Hey, Wamuu just lost!

What a disappointment.

That fool was just posturing.

Your friends are so low,
it makes me want to puke.

Lord Kars...

H-He's drinking us.

Now only I remain.

However...

I alone always stand on top!

Look at Lord Kars!

Lord Kars is...!

He's ready to fight!

But Lord Kars, there's no reason
to fight one-on-one!

Who needs rules? Let us take them!

We'll turn them into sprays of blood!

I thought you'd do this!

I told you!

T-The Red Stone!

It's me against Kars, one-on-one.

But if you don't like those terms,

I'll just smash it!

I'm a man of my word.

One-on-one.

My promise still stands.

That's why I revealed my horn to you.

As for my underlings' behavior,
they're already dead, as you can see.

Lord Kars?!

All I want is that Red Stone.

However, Wamuu and Esidisi
were my comrades for 10,000 years.

I must honor both their deaths
and their pride.

I will fight you Hamon-users fairly...

...and finish this with my own hands.

And Lisa Lisa, after seeing you fight,
I won't think of you as a woman.

I will fight you with all my strength.

Come!

We fight over there.

The temple at Piz Berlina.

Champions once came here to drink the

blood of the fallen mixed with liquor.

They thanked the gods
for the joy of life.

It's not an arena,
but it will add to our fight.

C-Coach Lisa Lisa, you may be strong,
but you're still a woman.

He looks weaker than Wamuu.
I'll take him!

You won't.

I haven't lived my life so that
a stripling has to stand up for me.

You're 50, all right!

I will use my Brilliant Bone Blade.

I would offend Wamuu
if I didn't offer you a weapon.

Take your pick.

My scarf will suffice.

I see.

Then let us fight.

T-There's no violence in Kars's stance.

How can he fight without violence?

What's wrong? Not coming?

Then I'll have to make a move!

Kars disappeared with that light!

W-Where is he?!

Kars... I can feel something...

But it's coming from both
above and below.

Brilliant Bone Blade!

A crack in the pillar!

Snake Muffler!

This Satiporoja beetle scarf
is a perfect Hamon conductor.

It is a weapon and a life-detector!

It even picks up attacks from behind!

S-She did it!

That's my coach! Wonderful!

He didn't compare to Wamuu,
but barkers seldom bite!

Though you are better than me, coach!

Wha--?!

L-Lord Kars!

Kars is behind her.

Who is b-below her?

W-What the...?!

What the hell is going on?!

Kars wasn't the one fighting!

It was a double!

How utterly stupid.

Why would I fight one-on-one?

All I want is the Red Stone.

My goal is to be the ultimate life form.

I am not a warrior like Wamuu,
nor am I a romantic.

No matter what the method,
in the end...

...victory is all that matters!

T-That's why I felt no violence.

He never intended to fight me himself.

It's over!

Jo...Jo...

The Red Stone is mine!

Now all that's left is for all of you
to kill that annoying JoJo!

K-Kars!

You're going down!

Kars!

Out of the way!
I'll split your damned skulls!

Zoom Punch!

Your Hamon isn't working.

He's weakened! Now--

Rebuff Overdrive!

You look worn out.

Your breathing is ragged
and your Hamon is weak.

And you're all that's left of
the Hamon-users Lisa Lisa trained.

Will you last?

Will you last, JoJo?

Will you last?

S-Son of a...

Flay him alive!

C-Crap!

T-That light!

That face!

Listen up, vampires!

You're up against von Stroheim
and the German elite!

And we're the Speedwagon Foundation
Special Forces!

JoJo!

JoJo!

I-It's Speedwagon!

And Smokey from New York!

My right leg is a bit stiff...

...but my body has been repaired!

Now taste our anti-vampire weaponry!

Ultraviolet lasers!

The Speedwagon Foundation miniaturized them,

but he does like to brag.

Crafty little creatures.

Where is JoJo?

He's gone!

He's as quick as ever.

Take your eyes off him
and he'll hatch a scheme in no time.

You crossed a line
you shouldn't have crossed.

You said you'd fight fairly,
but you cheated Lisa Lisa!

And that act betrayed the memory
of Wamuu, your fallen comrade!

You can save your indignation, scum.

The end justifies the means.

All that matters is the Red Stone.

You have to save effort,
minimize danger,

avoid risks,
and move your pawns carefully.

That is the real battle.

And now I'll maneuver you
into my hands and to your death.

Let me tell you something, Kars!

I've never hated anyone as much as you!

You hate me?

Then show me.

One-on-one. We'll fight
one-on-one like you wanted.

Lisa Lisa is mostly dead.

But only mostly.

I did that on purpose. I left her alive.

Why would I do that?

She's another pawn.

JoJo, she's a pawn I can use
against you.

Bastard!

I've sewn her feet together
with this rope.

Why am I doing this?

Here's why!

Lisa Lisa!

Off you go!

She'd be a bad pawn if she fell!

If you let go, she'll splatter
on the ground and die!

J-JoJo! Lisa Lisa!

Lisa Lisa?

That Lisa Lisa?

Do you mean the baby on the ship
Granny Erina told us about?

T-That means that woman is JoJo's...

Now you're glued to that spot.

Welcome to real battle, JoJo.

I'll just walk up to you
and slice you down while you can't move!

Kars, you bastard!

I hope you rot in hell forever!

JoJo doesn't know.

He doesn't know that
that woman is his own mother!

Next episode

Are the vampires finished?!

I want to kill you at my leisure.

The fire is a gamble!

This child... This child...

Don't, von Stroheim!

No!

Chapter 24: The Ties that Bind JoJoUsing Caesar's bandana,
JoJo barely defeated Wamuu.

Next, Lisa Lisa faced off against Kars.

Von Stroheim and Speedwagon
appeared suddenly with help.

However, in a cowardly turn,
Kars used a double to fight.

He sprang out and
stabbed Lisa Lisa in the back.

JoJo and Lisa Lisa are in
the greatest peril of their lives!

Kars, you bastard!
I hope you rot in hell forever!

JoJo doesn't know.

He doesn't know that
that woman is his own mother!

Don't let go, JoJo.

It's a forest of crystal spikes below.
She'd die instantly.

K-Kars!

Your soul is as rotten as a pumpkin

left in a field that even flies won't visit!

Shout at me. Grumble at me. Insult me.

While you're holding that rope,
that's all you can really do.

From the silent depths

The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

Crimson blood

Summons the valorous to stand up

If inherited love is called fate

Then take another step with smiling eyes

Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

Destiny written into your veins

The undying bonds of honor arise

Take hold of them

Chapter 24: The Ties that Bind JoJo

JoJo! Lisa Lisa!

JoJo doesn't realize
his mother's life is in his hands!

Mr. Speedwagon, we should tell him!

No.

Why not?!

It's not the time.

Von Stroheim, are you done
with the vampires?!

We have to help JoJo!

Give me a break!

You think we can get rid of them
in just a minute or two?!

Get out of my sight!

It's no good. They need more time!

JoJo...

Careful, the rope will slip
if you don't watch it.

While you're holding the rope,
your hasty feet can only move so far.

He kicked Kars,
but Hamon didn't flow into him!

W-We're in a real fix!

Looks like your Hamon is running dry.

You might have just enough
for one last, all-out attack.

I'll just stroll up to you and take

your life like I'm plucking a flower.

Kars!

It's true I might have barely enough
in me for one final attack.

I'm not exactly confident.

But even so, I've come up with a plan.

It's something to make you choke!

Do you want to know what it is?

I won't tell you!

Hey!

You're not tying any ropes together!

This is a match!

What do you think I'll do with it?

Wh-What is JoJo up to?

He set his scarf on fire!

Before this fire burns me,

I'll use all I've got
left to send you packing!

The fire is a gamble!

It's a risk to motivate me!

I seek life within death!

JoJo...

An act like that...

...is just desperation!

Don't toy with me.

You're just dodging around
in order to catch your breath.

I'll say it again:
I want to kill you at my leisure.

I won't play king of the apes!

Come on, now! I need to breathe!

Who cares if I look silly?

Listen.

I can cut Lisa Lisa's rope
whenever I please.

And if you dodge again, I will!

Is that all right?

Should I cut it?

You want me to do it?

You don't, do you?

Don't!

You ran before. Now come to me, slowly.

If you want me to cut the rope,
stay where you are.

The coward!

What's your choice?

Is your life more precious
than this woman's?

Here's my choice!

I don't know what you're planning,

but if I cut this, you'll fall as well!

You fool!

JoJo!

Lisa Lisa!

Idiot. That's two birds with one cut.

What the...?!

He...!

This rope is connected to JoJo!

When did he do it?!

He didn't have the time!

When he first kicked, he let himself
be cut along with the rope!

While he lit the match, he secretly tied

his leg to her rope and made a loop.

He needed a distraction.

So he set his scarf on fire.

And then to tie the ropes together,

he let Lisa Lisa be cut down on purpose!

That cunning devil!

Now you're holding me and Lisa Lisa up!

You deceived me, JoJo!

I never thought I'd hear that from you!

It seems you like tricking,
but you hate to be tricked!

You may have lived
for over 10,000 years.

But to compete with my skills,
you need another decade!

Kars!

Your time is up!

Hamon Overdrive!

D-Did it work?

T-That was the last of my Hamon.

I'm burned out.

I don't have any Hamon left.

I-It got into him!

Yes!

He did it! He hit Kars with Hamon!

Off you go!

You...

Look! Kars fell into the crystal spikes!

He's finished! See?

Hamon will travel right up his arm!

You're weak! Your time is up!

Even we could finish you now!

He's trying to spook us.

All right! Let's eliminate him for good!

Bring out the UV amplifier!

Yes, sir!

Coach Lisa Lisa...

Kars said he didn't quite kill you.

I don't think he hit anything vital.

If we act quickly,
I'm sure you'll live through this.

It's finally over.

It is. I'm glad.

Hey, Mr. Speedwagon?

Can I ask you something?

What is it?

Why did Granny Erina tell JoJo
his mother died when he was little?

Why does Lisa Lisa
hide her past from him?

Smokey, that's...

Granny Erina told me not to ask you,
but I have to know!

She's his mother.
Keeping that from him is awful.

Smokey...

JoJo and Granny Erina are my friends.

They saved me from crooked cops,
even though I was just a thief.

That's why I'm here!
I'll do all I can to help.

All right, Smokey.

I'll tell you.

You did take good care of Erina
while I was away from New York.

But promise not to tell JoJo!

This is a Joestar family issue.

It's not our place to talk about it.

The name Lisa Lisa is an alias.

Her real name is Elizabeth.

She was raised by
a Hamon-user named Straizo.

She and Erina's son, George,
fell in love and got married.

George and Elizabeth had a son.
You know him as JoJo.

JoJo's father George was
a member of the Royal Flying Corps.

Aviation developed rapidly
during the First World War.

George was among the first
brave pilots to fly into battle.

He stood out as a hero
even among the Royal Flying Corps.

However...

...a gut-wrenching horror from the past

came back to haunt the Joestars.

Fifty years before, Dio had created
blood-sucking zombies.

Straizo, myself and the others
thought we had exterminated them.

But one had escaped, hid within society,
and lived for decades undiscovered!

He was a cunning, intelligent creature.

He created no spawn.

He ate even the bones and hair
of his victims, leaving no evidence.

And by some wicked twist of fate...

...he worked as a commander
in the Royal Flying Corps!

T-The Royal Flying Corps?

With JoJo's dad?

The same.

George uncovered his secret.

He had listened well to Straizo and me.

But ultimately,
George was an ordinary man.

He had character and talent,
but he hadn't trained with Hamon.

Before he could unmask the commander,

he was discovered and attacked!

His message to Straizo wasn't in time.

George's death was covered up
as a nighttime plane crash.

Straizo and I found this suspicious,
and eventually found the truth.

That night, I told Elizabeth
as she held an infant JoJo.

Instead of showing grief...

...she flew out of the house!

She was a genius with Hamon,
but her emotions consumed her!

She was witnessed
when she killed the commander.

The military didn't know
about zombies or Hamon.

They concluded that Elizabeth
had attacked their beloved commander,

killed him, and burned his body.

Soon she was known around the world

as a murderer and national traitor.

We used all the Speedwagon Foundation's
resources to cover her trail.

Elizabeth had to leave England behind

without even a word to her son.

Erina knew what had happened,
and she had a request.

When this child grows up
and asks about his parents...

...please tell him they both died.

This child...

This child...

And so Elizabeth became Lisa Lisa.

Why?

Why is it that way?

At least say his mother is alive!

I know painfully well why.

Erina lost her husband and son in

the battle between Hamon and the masks.

But thinking of her grandson, of JoJo...

...she didn't want Hamon in his life!

Lisa Lisa is the same way!

Such a tragic family.

Such a miserable fortune.

But now...

Now JoJo...

JoJo used Hamon
to save his mother's life!

Mr. Speedwagon...

Now there's no reason
for Lisa Lisa to hide.

JoJo knows about Hamon,
and he used it to save his mother!

True.

But it's not up to me.

We have to know how Erina
and Lisa Lisa feel first.

But...

Colonel!

We're ready to fire!

Right! Aim it right at him!

We will have the honor
of executing Kars!

Prepare to die, Kars!

I can't tell you how good it feels
to order this myself!

Don't, von Stroheim! The mask!

The Stone is in his mask!
UV light will help him!

D-Damn it!

Stop! Don't fire the UV amplifier!

N-No!

I-I didn't see him holding the mask.

I didn't see him put the Red Stone in!

Dear God...

Kars...

Next episode

The ultimate life form...

He can manipulate life at will!

Is there no way to stop him?

Kars, the Ultimate Thing, is born!

Chapter 25: The Birth of a SuperbeingN-No!

I-I didn't see him holding the mask.

I didn't see him put the Red Stone in!

Dear God...

Kars...

Chapter 25: The Birth of a Superbeing

He stood up!

Stand your ground!
German soldiers are not cowards!

The ultimate being?

Madness! No creature could
ever become perfect!

Kars...

Look at his arm!
It's still smoking!

The Hamon will ruin him!

He'll melt where he stands!

He might have put the Red Stone
into the mask,

but he is still utterly the same!

And he'll die like that!

Fire the UV amplifier again!

We'll end him for sure this time.

Hurry it up!

Sir!

What's going on with him?

What is he staring at?

L-Look!

See? Over there!

Wh-What the hell is that?!

Am I seeing things?
His hand turned into a squirrel!

It's kind of cute, actually.

Look out!

It's dangerous!
Stay away from that squirrel!

The squirrel!

Get out of here! Hurry!

Unbelievable!
He can manipulate life at will!

Hooray!

The sun is rising!

The vampires...

The sunlight will take care of Kars.
We're saved!

It's no good. He's fine!

He's still standing, even under the sun!

This is a nightmare! It can't be!

This looks like our doom!

A perfect life form combines
the abilities of all other life forms.

It combines all life into one.

But this...

Breathtaking. Such beautiful radiance.

That light is the most
wonderful thing I've seen.

And now I have conquered it.

H-He's invincible!

He has no weaknesses!
Even Hamon won't work on him!

He's immortal! Unstoppable!
No one can beat him!

He is complete!
Kars, the Ultimate Thing, is born!

T-This is my fault.

I let him put on the mask
with the Red Stone in it.

Is... Is there no way to stop him?

Are we humans destined to die,
to become food for him?

No, I have a plan.

What was that, JoJo?

Hold her.

Yeah...

I have one last plan.

A final plan?

Yeah, I save it for last.

What is it?

JoJo, d-do you mean that final plan?

Listen up!
Do it till your last breath!

Do what until my last breath?

Run away!

I knew it!

Hamon-users mean nothing to me now.

But you...

Wamuu and Esidisi need to be avenged,
and I must celebrate.

JoJo, your death...

...will be dedicated to my birth!

He's catching up!

Pipe down!

I'm trying to think up with something!
Keep quiet!

JoJo's going out there to save Lisa Lisa
and the rest of us!

But it's useless! No plan of his could
overcome what Kars has become!

He's coming! Hurry!

Hey, Smokey!

I don't think you understand,
so I'll tell you something!

There's no reason for you to be
running with me!

Kars is after my blood alone!

He thinks killing me is the best way
to ring in his new life!

JoJo, there's something
you have to hear!

Lisa Lisa, your coach, she's your...

He's here! He's here!

Speedwagon, is he...?

Is he really the perfect being?

Yes, the power of the Red Stone will

make him into the ultimate life form!

A perfect being is: One, invincible.

Two, does not age.

Three, will not ever die.

Four, has the abilities of all
other life forms, and outperforms them.

In addition, it is like a Greek statue,
a model for beauty.

T-There's no way to stop him now.

He has no weakness at all!

Humans can't kill him,
not with Hamon or even the sun!

JoJo!

Smokey, your path ends here!

Tell me about it later!

JoJo!

That won't save you.

Let's see who's stronger, Kars!

That's...!

One of our warplanes!

JoJo!

The feathers are
as hard as armadillo shell.

They are coated in an oil
that deflects bullets.

Naturally, their hardness makes them
weapons as well as shields.

His feathers are like knives!

This looks bad!

But...

I got on this plane
to get away from you!

JoJo!

All he can do now is run!

Fly, JoJo! Fly!

That's all we humans can do now.

Current speed: 240 km/h.

No matter how evolved he might be,
he's still just an animal.

I'm safe for now.

I guess he can't keep up
with a plane for long.

The fuel!

Two hours left.

So I can run away for two hours.

Does that fool think he can run
from me for even a moment?

You'll never land safely now.

You won't stand on the earth again.

JoJo! JoJo!

Do you read me? Respond, JoJo!

Hey, Speedwagon!

JoJo! Grabbing that plane
was a smart move!

The Germans and I will do what we can
to help you get away!

Do you have a chart?

It's right here.

Good. Maintain radio contact.

I'll give you the plan.

What?!

First, give us your current position.

JoJo, do you read me?

What's wrong? Hey!

JoJo, respond! JoJo!

Yeah, I read you.

But Speedwagon, no technique
or weapon will work on Kars.

You said he was immortal.

Yeah, I did.
Your plan to run is all we can do.

Listen up, old man.
I have a different idea.

What idea?

Now JoJo, don't do anything rash!

Just keep away from him!

We won't be able to stop him later!

No! Don't even think
of doing something on your own!

Just listen to me, okay?

He's the ultimate being on earth!

But he's from Earth.
This planet gave him life.

And it might take him back!

What do you mean?

How would the Earth take him back?

Magma!

Magma, the hottest thing on earth!

I'll drive him into the lava
at Isola di Volgano to kill him!

D-Don't! You've risked your life
more than enough times!

Let us and the Germans handle it!

Listen to him, JoJo!
Don't be crazy!

Kars will kill you!

Sorry, I can already see the volcano.

The time is now!

Mr. Speedwagon...

It's happening again...

Jonathan's father,
Jonathan and George...

The men of the Joestar family
all led short lives.

I don't want to lose you, too!

Please stop, JoJo!

For Lisa Lisa's sake, too!

Lisa Lisa is your mother!

What was that? Say again!

What is that noise?

This is insane!

Piranhas?!
What the hell?!

They're chewing up the plane!

How did they get in?!

Kars's feathers!

They transformed!

Damn it! My parachute!

You little bastards!

Wh-What now?!

JoJo!

What's going on? Respond!

JoJo!

JoJo! JoJo!

You're brainless.

That parachute is like a spider's web
trapping you, JoJo.

You're just a little butterfly.

I'll take my time killing you!

What?!

I-It's a dummy!

Kars, I'm not going down
without a fight!

You're going with me into that volcano!

JoJo!

Damn you!

Lunatic!

Granny Erina, you told me about
my grandfather once.

You said he sank into the Atlantic
with his lifelong foe to save you.

I hate to sadden you again.

But I guess
this is the Joestar blood in me.

Did you really think I couldn't get away
before you hit the ground?

Kars!

You're dying alone, JoJo!

W-What the...?!

Kars, this plane will be your coffin.

You!

Von Stroheim!

How and when did you get in there?!

I wasn't sure you could handle it alone!

It was cold in this pontoon.

But you came.

But it's time to jump, JoJo!

What do you mean jump?

But I don't even have a parachute!

Listen to me and jump out of the plane!

JoJo, respond!

Say something! Anything!

Just talk to me, JoJo!

JoJo...

Von Stroheim...you crazy bastard.

You're even crazier than me!

B-But I have to thank you.

Y-You look all right,
but what about Kars?

Did Kars take a lava dive?!

You...worms...

Next episode

Did you say Hamon Overdrive?

Bless our mother earth!

Don't you wish to purge your fears?!

JoJo!

Farewell, everyone.

Chapter 26: The Ascendant OneLong ago, an already extraordinary man
wished for further power.

He could live like the birds,
dwell with the fish,

breathe like the trees,
and move like the water.

But he could not face the sun.

So he created a stone mask.

One day he would befriend the sun.

And the world would be his!

Chapter 26: The Ascendant One

Kars...

Did Kars take a lava dive?!

You...worms...

We got him!

I-I need armor.

Like a clam or a crab...

...I'll make armor.

I'll cover myself.

It's not enough!

It's melted rock, idiot!

It's over a thousand degrees!

You're gonna burn to a crisp!

Yeowch!

T-That did it!

Finally!

We finally took down Kars!

JoJo, that shock triggered an eruption!

Let's get to safety
before celebrating!

Good idea. Hang on tight!

What a wonderful sound.

It's music to my ears.

I've been longing to hear
that song from you, JoJo!

Kars...but how?!

A bit of his shell.

I see. Kars...

First, Kars covered himself
in a shell like a crab.

But it was still organic.

It couldn't withstand the lava's heat
and burned away instantly.

Kars's secret
was in a second layer of armor!

That second layer...

...was bubbles!

The bubbles created a layer of air
between Kars's body and the lava.

Heat from lava
Air
Kars's body

As the outer layer burned,
more bubbles came up to replace it.

Kars could survive in lava
for a few minutes.

The Earth gave birth to life.

But now! Alas! In the end...

...Kars had conquered the Earth!

Long, long ago, far earlier than
man's first recorded history

a certain group of creatures evolved
on our planet.

They could only live at night,

as they died when exposed to the sun.

So they lived below ground.

Even without the sun, they led long
lives feeding on other living things.

Early humans that appeared
feared them as gods or demons.

Few died, so they did not have many
children and their population was small.

They knew no strife and lived in peace.

But then...

...a genius was born among them.

There is strength hidden in this body,
abilities undreamed of.

I will unlock greater power!

The genius created a stone mask.

The mask granted him undying power,
but he required more life energy.

He had to consume
more creatures to live.

If left unchecked,
he would eventually consume all life.

His brethren began to fear the mask

and its gifted creator!

His existence is a threat!

He has to be removed from this world!

We have to destroy him!

Fool! Don't you wish to conquer the sun?

Don't you wish to rule over all?

Don't you wish to purge your fears?!

Then fall.

The genius slaughtered all his brethren,

including the parents who raised him.

He and one companion took
the two surviving babies and left.

They set off on a journey
in search of ultimate power.

And ten thousand years later,
that power was in his hands!

He's a god. He's become a god.

Humans can't stand before a god!

Submission is our only chance!

What was that?
Did you just say something, JoJo?

Die! Overdrive!

Ha...mon?

Did you say Hamon Overdrive?

JoJo!

That shock!

I'm melting! No!

My leg is melting!

What? It's like he used...!

It can't be!

It is! That was Hamon, you dimwit!

I conquered the sun, and you still
thought Hamon was beyond me?!

W-What?!

And it looks like my

Hamon is hundreds of times
more potent than yours.

Hundreds of times more potent?!

It's like being burned by the sun!

His flesh is liquefying
and then vaporizing!

So how do you like that taste
of your own medicine?

An excellent response.

Well, let me ease your suffering.

JoJo!

This is it. I'm going to die.

It's over for me.

JoJo accepted this fact completely.

He felt no fear, no pain, no regret.

He thought, I did all I could.

Before the epitome of evil, he watched

his dying self with ice-cold awareness.

Von Stroheim was no different.

Unable to move, he felt he knew how it

felt to be a frog swallowed by a snake.

This way of breathing...

To send a Hamon-user like you
into the black pit of death...

...Hamon really is a poetic vehicle!

Hamon...

...far greater than mine...

Sail into the infinite abyss
of oblivion!

Hamon?!

What?!

The Red Stone!

What?!

The Red Stone!

The Red Stone of Aja!

Why did JoJo hold the Red Stone
toward Kars?

Even he didn't know!

It was instinctive.

He felt the Red Stone
being drawn toward Hamon.

But JoJo's body understood.

His body moved in order to survive.

JoJo's will to live
pushed his body into action!

T-The Red Stone is a Hamon amplifier.

That energy made the volcano's eruption
reach a sudden peak!

T-The whole slab they were on
was blasted into the sky!

S-Such tremendous force!

But do you think a little eruption
will be enough to get rid of me, JoJo?!

I'll become a bird to escape!

Goodbye forever, JoJo!

Bless our Mother Earth!
It shot my arm all the way up here!

Now, Kars!

Your line is,
Did you plan this, too, JoJo?!

Did you plan this, too...

For an instant, Kars was distracted
by JoJo's arm! One fatal instant!

Hot chunks of rock he could have dodged
launched him higher!

Did you plan this, too, JoJo?!

What do you think?!
I planned every little detail!

I stacked the whole deck!

That's a total lie,
but it'll drive Kars crazy!

The material released in the eruption
reached escape velocity!

Even the Earth's power
couldn't kill Kars!

But instead...

...it blasted him out of the atmosphere!

Stars?! N-No!

It's over.

Granny...

Von Stroheim...

Speedwagon...

Smokey...

And Lisa Lisa...

Farewell, everyone.

Jo...

JoJo!

Eight hours later, von Stroheim returned
alive to tell Speedwagon this:

On February 28, 1939, Joseph Joestar
passed away on Isola di Volgano.

I'm in outer space?!

I'll use jets of air to change my
trajectory and return to Earth!

I-It's not working!

I-I'm freezing!

The air is freezing around me!

It turns to ice the moment
it comes out of me!

I-I can't change direction!

I can't go back!

Kars never returned to the Earth.

He became half-mineral, half-animal
and floated forever through space.

And though he wished for death,
he was unable to die.

So eventually, he stopped thinking.

Outside New York City
April 1939

Our Father who art in heaven,

hallowed be thy name.

Thy kingdom come,

thy will be done,

on earth, as it is in heaven.

Goodbye, JoJo.

Now that I think of it,
we only met six months ago.

But I'll always remember you.

Always.

Come, Erina, you mustn't catch cold.

Let's go home.

Just a bit longer.

Guess who?

Hey, everybody!

I finally got to New York
and nobody was there to meet me!

So I heard you were all at a funeral.
I looked high and low!

Hey, Coach Lisa Lisa!
Are you all healed up?

Meshina, you're here too!

I want to ask von Stroheim if he can

fix my hand up with some gadgets.

But it looks like war with the Germans.

Hey, now! What are you thinking?!

This is a funeral, you idiot!

Who's an idiot?!

Hey, did you just call me an idiot?!

Just calm down. Let's go have a talk.

It's...

No way!

Hey! Don't start any trouble!

You aren't getting away
with calling me an idiot!

JoJo!

JoJo's alive!

Alive?

H-Hang on, now!
What's with all the surprise?

It's like you saw a ghost!

Bwah! Why's my name on a headstone?!

D-Don't tell me this is...

JoJo!

You're still recovering,
so you shouldn't stand in the rain!

Take this.

I-It's Suzie Q.

What's that ring on her finger?

Y-You don't know about my wife, either?!

Your wife?!

Your wife? Oh, my!

Being introduced as your wife...

It makes me blush!

Right?

Don't right me!

Back when the volcano erupted...

...the rock I was on shielded me
and fell into the sea.

A fishing boat picked me up.

Then you nursed me back to health
in Venice for two weeks.

But they haven't heard.

You sent a telegram, right?!

T-Telegram?

Yeah, you said you would!

Let's not get all clicky now.

I'm sorry! I forgot!

Oh, no! Unbelievable!
What is that woman thinking?!

Get back here!

JoJo is alive!

I said I'm sorry!

Sorry doesn't cut it!

JoJo...

Later, Lisa Lisa, Elizabeth Joestar,
told JoJo she was his mother.

They moved to America.

In 1948, she married a Hollywood
screenwriter.

Erina Joestar continued her work
as a teacher.

In 1950, at age 81, she died peacefully,

surrounded by those who loved her.

Robert E. O. Speedwagon continued
with his various enterprises

and helped to further
science and medicine.

In 1952, he died
of a heart attack at age 89.

He remained single.

Smokey Brown worked his way through
college, majoring in political science

and became the first black mayor
in Georgia, his home state.

Rudol von Stroheim never saw JoJo again.

In 1943, he died as a proud German
soldier, fighting in Stalingrad.

We are the world's greatest!

Time flowed onward...

JFK International Airport, New York
1987

...to a new generation.

And JoJo...

Oh, I bumped you. Are you okay?

Oh, dear.
You should watch where you're going.

You're right. I'm fine.

We all make mistakes.

Wait a minute. Are you Japanese?

Yeah, why?

Then I take that back!

Alitalia flight 285 for Tokyo
is now boarding.

My only daughter has been married

to a Japanese man for over 20 years now.

Why did she get married
on the other side of the world?

My own grandson doesn't know my face!

I'll never forgive the Japanese!

But...

...I do like my Walkman.

From the silent depths

The pillars awaken from ages-long sleep

Crimson blood

Summons the valorous to stand up

If inherited love is called fate

Then take another step with smiling eyes

Mystify the darkness, dodge in a blink

Avoid the blade,
find an opening and strike

Conviction tested
opens the way to the future

Like a bloody storm
Hot like a bloody stone

Destiny written into your veins

The undying bonds of honor arise

Take hold of them

Part 2: Battle Tendency -- Fin

Atlantic Ocean, near the Canary Islands
1983

Y-Yahoo! We finally got it!

R-Relax! Just bring it up!

It's a hundred-year-old treasure chest!

L-Let's pop it open!All rights for this production are reserved to the copyright holder, and distribution

— 1983: The Canary Islands, Off the Northwest African Coast —

W-We did it!

We finally pulled up the treasure chest
that sank one hundred years ago!

All right! Careful now!

Keep calm! Just bring it this way...

I know! I know!

Up we go.

Isn't it a bit long and narrow
to be a treasure chest?

Hey! You're lifting it too high!

Okay, I'm putting it down.

One, two, three!

All right! H-Hurry up and pry it open.

Wait. Th-This is bizarre.

This box is locked from the inside.

Who the hell cares? Bust it open!

Just hang on! There's something written on it.

D-I-O... DIO.

Is it a name?

What the hell does it matter?!

The sun's going to set soon.

Once it gets dark, we won't
be able to see anything!

Yeah, you're right.

Okay, I'll go get the blowtorch.

Let's say hello to our treasure!

One day, an unmanned
cabin cruiser was spotted.

The boat was in perfect working order,
and there were no signs of an attack.

Aboard, there were only
three half-full cups of coffee,

and...

On deck, a steel box, which had been
opened with an acetylene torch.

The box was empty,

and strangely, it had two compartments,
as if designed to shelter something.

It was thought to have contained treasure,

but after a few months, it was forgotten.

Jotaro Kujo, 17 years old.
Height: 195 centimeters.

His father is Japanese, and a jazz musician.

1987: Japan

He's currently on tour.

His mother is an American of British descent.

Yes, Jotaro is definitely my son.

Apparently, his friends at school call him "Jojo,"

derived from the "Jo" of Jotaro and the "jo" in Kujo.

That's pretty dumb!

S-So...

How many people did Jotaro kill?!

No! Don't tell me! I don't want to hear! No!

Uh, who said he killed anybody?

He got into a fight.

Actually, the thugs he faced were
armed with nunchucks and knives.

There were four, including a former boxer,

and between them, fifteen bones were broken.

They all had their balls crushed, too...

Ah, pardon my language...
And they were sent to the hospital.

Ma'am, please make sure he learns his lesson!

Okay!

But the problem is what happened after.

Could you copy this and pass it around?

Yes, sir.

Your son is quite the oddball.

Come in. We'll show you the way.

Thank you.

Well, anyway, please take him home.

What? He's being released already?

Well, we can't keep him forever.

By the way, ma'am,
your Japanese is very good.

How long have you lived in Japan?

Twenty years.

Ah, no wonder.

Good work, gentlemen.

We've had our hands full lately.

There's even a waiting list for cells.

Your son is just up ahead.

Jotaro!

Jotaro, throw the ball to Mama!

Very good!

Do your best at the sports meet tomorrow.

Yeah!

Jotaro...

Entrance Ceremony

We should celebrate.
What would you like to eat today?

I just want to eat your cooking, Mom.

Jotaro... Jotaro...

Jotaro... Jotaro...

Jotaro!

Shut the hell up!

You're so damn annoying, you bitch!

Bam!

Okay!

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

Stardust Crusaders

He's actually a very sweet child.
Episode 1: The Man Possessed by an Evil Spirit

He's not capable of doing something so appalling.

Hey! Don't fall asleep, Kujo!

You're being released. Get out!

What part of "go home" don't you understand?!

Mom, go home.

I'm not going to leave here for a while.

I've been possessed by an evil spirit.

I don't know what he'll make me do.

Even during the fight,
it took all I had to stop it.

So don't let me out of this cell.

For crying out loud...
See what I'm talking about, ma'am?

We're trying to release him,
but he refuses to leave.

Forgive my asking, but is
your son all right upstairs?

This isn't a hotel!

Please! Let us change cells!

He's telling the truth!

There really is an evil spirit possessing him!

It's terrifying!

We won't do anything bad again!

That's enough! Quiet down!

Wh-What is that?

You've been locked up!
How'd you get that in here?!

I told you.

It's the evil spirit.

The evil spirit brings things to me.

Nokotta! Nokotta! Nokotta!

He tosses him out of the ring!
Chiyonofuji wins all fourteen matches!
H-He's listening to a boombox
and reading Shonen Jump!

H-How?! Th-This is a problem!

This is a huge problem!

Hold it!

This might not be enough to
stop you from releasing me.

I'll show you what a terror
my evil spirit can be.

Just so you'll understand how
dangerous it could be to let me out.

M-My gun! How?!

W-We've got trouble!

Well? Did you guys see
my evil spirit just now?!

If you didn't, then...

J-Jotaro!

There's someone behind me.

It seems to have possessed me recently.

His grandpa, Joseph, had strange powers...

B-But what's happening to my son?

Jotaro Kujo

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

Papa!

Over here, Papa! Over here!

Holly! Hey, outta my way!

Papa!

Papa!

I'm so glad you came!

If my only daughter needs my help,

I can be anywhere in the world within 24 hours!

Where's Mama?

She complained...

But I told Suzie it was a business
trip for Joestar Real Estate Agency.

Papa...

Holly... Holly.

Hey, Holly! Get off of me already!

No!

It's been forever since you've held me, Papa!

Look, you...

You're a 45-year-old woman.
How can you talk like that?

Oh, now you've done it!
I'm going to tickle you!

Tickle, tickle, tickle...
Hey! Stop that!

Take that and that!

What the hell are you guys staring at?

Mama...

Don't look!

I'll take your bag.

By the way, Holly, about Jotaro...

You're certain he said "evil spirit"?

Oh... my dear Jotaro!

Yes. The policemen said they couldn't see it,

but I clearly saw it.

I saw a separate arm...

And it grabbed the gun!

Others couldn't see it, but you could?

Yes...

So Jotaro says that he's
been possessed recently,

but nothing strange has happened to you?

No. But Jotaro says he won't leave
the cell until he knows what's going on.

What should I do, Papa?

There, there, my beloved daughter.

I, Joseph Joestar, am here now,
so there's nothing to worry about.

Right.

First, I'd like to hurry

and see my grandson, Jotaro!

H-How terrifying!

He's got more stuff again...

And it's violent.

There's something terrifying possessing him...

I-If anyone outside found out about this,
I'd lose my job in a heartbeat.

Don't worry.

I'll take my grandson home.

"Grandson"?

Hey, what are you planning to do?

I told you, you can't go in any further!

Convince him from over here! It's dangerous!

It's fine. Step aside! Leave him to me.

We can't be held responsible for this! Y-You...

Come now, you're in the way.

Jotaro! It's your grandfather!

I'm sure he'll be able to help you!

Please come out with your grandfather.

Get out. We're going home.

Get lost.

I didn't ask you to come here.

Help me? What the hell can you do?

Sorry you came all the way from New York,

but there's no way you can help me.

Bam!

Th-The pinky from my artificial left hand!

When was it torn off?

You see? Do you get it now?

That's my evil spirit.

Don't get close to me.

You'll just shorten what
little life you have left.

H-How can this be? I don't believe it...

It was able to deceive me right off the bat...

Yes... I know exactly
what Jotaro's evil spirit is.

But rather than explaining it with words,

if he experiences the truth himself,

he'll understand it much better.

No, he needs to physically understand,

because of the dangers
he'll face in the future.

Avdol, you're up.

This is my Egyptian friend
I met three years ago,

Avdol.

Chase my grandson Jotaro out of this cell.

Don't.

He looks strong, but do you really
think I'd let someone

chase me out of here just
because you told him to do it?

Hell, no.

Now I'm just gonna be even more stubborn

and want to leave even less.

I'll have to get a bit violent.

But soon enough,
he'll be so addled with pain,

he'll be squealing,
"Please get me out of here."

That's fine.

Papa, what are you doing?

H-Hey, we can't have you—

Shut up.

Yes, sir!

That's...

That's right.

Avdol also has a so-called "evil spirit."

An evil spirit that Avdol can control freely!

The evil spirit's name is...

Magician's Red!

I-It's hot! Fire! I'm burning!
My arms are burning!

Wh-What is this evil spirit?

Kujo's plastered himself
against the wall and won't move.

I don't get this at all.

B-But isn't it getting sort of...

How is it that hot?!

That's insane! It's way too hot!

There it is! It's finally shown itself!

And the fact that it's so clearly
visible means it's very powerful.

Why you...

I can't believe he's able to
make it manifest this clearly!

I'm surprised you have an evil spirit, too.

And Grandpa, the identity of the evil spirit...

I know it, yes.

Mr. Joestar,

you asked me to get your
grandson out of the cell.

I was planning on holding back,

but considering its unexpected power,
one misstep and we'll be in danger.

Shall I stop?

If you still insist that I get him out,
I'll have to get violent enough

to send your grandson to the hospital.

That's fine. Give it a shot.

Yes, sir!

Red Bind!

This is...

It's so hot!

I have no idea what's going on!

Papa! What are you doing to Jotaro?!

Holly, be a good girl and keep quiet.

'Kay?

I-I can't breathe...

The evil spirit's withdrawing.

If the heat is restricting your breathing,

your evil spirit will weaken.

I shall reveal its identity!

It may seem like an evil spirit, but it is not.

Jotaro! What you believed to be an evil spirit

is a powerful vision,
created from your own life energy.

Because it appears next to you,
that vision is called...

A Stand!

Bam!

A Stand?

As told in Aesop's fable,

the cold wind only made the
traveler pull his coat on tight,

but the heat made him admit defeat.

Do you want to come out
of your cage now, Jojo?

Enough of this.

The reason I won't leave

is because I keep harming
others without realizing it.

Sure, it interests me that
you have an evil spirit, too.

But if you keep going,

you're gonna die.

He broke the toilet!

Th-That's destruction of property!

I warned you.

Bastard!

Don't say I didn't warn you!

Hey!

Why'd you suddenly turn your back on me?!

Turn and face me!

Mr. Joestar.

As you can see,
I've gotten him out of his cell.

But...

Are you saying you let me win?

Not exactly.

I truly did plan to send you to the hospital,

but I did not expect such power.

If I hadn't stopped this steel rod,
what were you going to do?

My Stand is Magician's Red.

It could melt a steel rod
like this in the air with ease.

Avdol has the same power as you.

You don't have to stay in that cell

to research your evil spirit any longer.

Magician's Red

Mohammed Avdol

Oh, thank goodness.

Jotaro finally came out of his cell.

You're so annoying, you bitch.

Okay!

Hey!

How dare you call your
own mother a bitch, huh?!

And, Holly, stop smiling
after he just called you that!

Okay!

Grandpa, there's one thing...

I'm going to ask you about
one thing I don't understand.

Why did you know about my evil spirit—
no, my Stand or whatever?

That's what I don't understand.

Very well.

I came all the way from
New York to explain that.

But in order to explain it,
I must start at the beginning.

This has to do with the Joestar family.

First, take a look at these pictures.

What are they?

That's a hundred-year-old coffin
pulled up from the Atlantic Ocean,

off the African coast four years ago.

Coffin?

After I obtained and researched it,

I found out that it was on the
boat where my grandfather,

the man four generations before you,
Jonathan Joestar, died.

It was apparently empty
when they discovered it.

But I know exactly what was inside!

Avdol and I are trying to
locate him as we speak.

Him? Hold on a sec.

You're making it sound like
there was a person in there.

Why would you call something lost
at sea for a hundred years "him"?

He is evil incarnate!

His name is DIO!

He has awakened from his hundred-year sleep.

We are fated to fight him!

What was that, Jotaro?!

Don't make a face like this
has nothing to do with you!

This face means,

"That was so stupid, I don't
know what to say," Gramps.

G-Gramps?

Avdol, was it?

I don't know who you are,
but you're sure full of yourself.

And Old Man, do you expect
me to hear such a crazy story

and just say, "Oh, I see," and believe it?

But is it not a fact that our
evil spirits are crazy, as well?

Well, whatever.

Soon, you'll have no choice but to believe.

If you ask me why I know of DIO's existence,

and why I'm after him...

I'll show you the reason.

Actually, about a year ago,

I also suddenly obtained an evil spirit,
or rather, the power of a Stand.

What?

Old Man, what did you—

I shall show you!

This is

my Stand!

Crash!

Did you see it?

The thorns that came from my hand?
This is my Stand!

Its power is to take spirit photos of
visions I captured from far-off places!

Though I have to smash and destroy a
30,000 yen camera every time I do it.

Sir, is something wrong?

We're fine. Go away.

Right...

The vision that's going to
appear in this picture,

Jotaro...

will be what determines your fate!

What?

Jotaro, Holly, have either of you ever
looked carefully at the back of your necks?

What do you mean?

You've probably never taken a close look.

But right around the base of my neck,
there is a star-shaped birthmark.

I'll ask again. What the hell does all this mean?

I asked my mother about it,

and she said that my father,
who died when I was young, also had it.

Apparently, those of the Joestar
bloodline all have this birthmark.

Hey, Old Man,

I'm asking you what's going
to show up on that photo.

It is our destiny, as yet undiscovered!

Papa...
Damn it, just show me what's on it already!

DIO!

He is always the one who
shows up in my spirit photos.

And on the back of his neck...

From this bastard's neck down,

is the body of my grandfather,
Jonathan Joestar,

Rumble

which that bastard has taken over!

A hundred years ago,
an incident occurred in the Atlantic Ocean.

I only know what I heard
from my grandmother, Erina,

but DIO took over the body of
my grandfather and survived!

And this much is certain:

He is currently hiding somewhere
in the world, plotting something!

It's been four years since he came back.

The reason my spirit photos and your evil spirits

all began manifesting in this past year...

is most likely DIO!

In the wider world, our gifts
are considered psychic powers.

I've had my Stand since birth,

but your powers are bound to DIO's body...

In other words, Jonathan's body,
by invisible threads.

All we can say now is that DIO's
existence is what brought forth

the powers that were dormant within you.

Avdol, from this photo,
can you tell where he is now?

I cannot. There's hardly any background visible.

As I thought.

I'll take a closer look.

Please. Hm?

Oh, Holly.

I apologize for bringing all this up so suddenly.

Now, let's go home.

Y-Yes...

I will be staying in Japan for a while.

And I'll be staying at your place.

Yes, Papa.

Let's go, Jotaro.

It happened again...

Just now, it felt as though
someone was watching me again.

Is it Jonathan's descendants, after all?

This body must be sending out some
kind of soul signal to his descendants.

Very well. This might be called fate...

A fate I must be rid of,

a destiny I must erase.

I have already made my move.

Jojo, what were you doing while you

Hey!

You're being too chummy! Stay away from him!

That's why I fell down the stairs.
There's no doubt about it.

But...

Are you all right?

He's able to summon a pretty strong Stand.

I see...

No wonder he wants me to get rid of him.

But...

He is no match for my Stand.

I still like Jojo better.

Me, too.

Me, too.

What?

What are you talking about?

Give it up.

I'm the best for Jojo.

At the time, I was weakened...

Because I was only a head.

If I hadn't stolen Jonathan Joestar's body...

If I didn't have his energy,

I would have had very little.

I never could have survived at the bottom
of the ocean for a hundred years.

But this body itself is like a
bond between parent and child,

and it seems to connect with his descendants.

They are aware of my existence.

The new power that I have acquired
by obtaining Jonathan's body...

The Stand!

This Stand also affects the
bodies of his descendants.

Advantages and disadvantages
come hand in hand. That is inevitable.

I must eliminate them...

I must eradicate Jonathan's family.

What's the deal with this cramped room?

This is why I hate Japan.

Avdol, how can you stand this?

It is quite fascinating...

This thing they call "the tea ceremony."

Tea ceremony, nothing.

Instant coffee is plenty good!

By the way, about DIO...

Mr. Joestar, now that we know of his existence,

wouldn't it be safe to assume
that he knows about us, as well?

Indeed. But if we don't
know what he's going to do,

or even know what his powers are...

Japanese coffee tastes terrible!

That's American coffee.

Jojo, how did you get that cut?

Nurse's Office

You didn't get into another fight, did you?

And take off your hat!

It's poor manners!

For pity's sake...

Sensei, has Jojo ever gotten hurt in a fight?

There's no way that would happen.

Yeah!

Well, you've got a point.

Then I guess I'll believe that
you just fell, you scatterbrain.

Hey, hold on.

What are you trying to do?

I'm cutting your pants.

Like hell you are.

Well, I can't treat you through them.

I'll take them off.

Cutting them is a waste.

You're surprisingly stingy.

Now then, while Jojo is taking off his pants,

I'll take your temperatures and
prove that you're faking ill.

We really have colds.

Yeah. Let us go home early.

Nope!

Whoops.

What is this?

Jotaro Kujo, I will kill you today
with my Stand! —Noriaki Kakyoin

K-Kakyoin?

Hey... S-Sensei!

What are you doing?!

What does it look like?

Swish

I'm waving around the
thermometer to reset it.

Swish

Th-Thermometer? Sensei...

Sensei, that's a pen!

A pen? Did you say a pen?!

Does this look like a pen to you?!

How... How stupid can you be?

This thermometer actually
looks like a pen to you?!

Then have a...

better...

look!

Stab

She's...

Noriaki Kakyoin

My eye! My eye!

Jojo...

You're not going to say

that this looks like a pen, are you?!

How is she so strong?

This isn't a woman's strength.

I saw something unknown
crawling up from the floor earlier.

Was it a Stand?

Noriaki Kakyoin...

Was he the one who cut my leg on the stairs?

Precisely.

Y-You're...

Hey. Short time no see.

My Stand's possessed that
nurse and is controlling her.

Attacking my Stand will
mean hurting that nurse, Jojo.

You bastard... Just who the hell are you?!

I told you. I'm Noriaki Kakyoin.

The name of my Stand is Hierophant Green.

I am human, but my loyalty is to him...

Therefore...

I shall kill you!

Bang

I won't hurt her.

Now that I've dragged it out... I see...

It's just a sleazy Stand that can't
do anything but possess people.

Kakyoin, this is your Stand?

All green and striped...
It looks like a shiny melon.

You're going to regret

dragging that out of her, Jojo.

Squish

Don't try to act tough.

I can see my finger marks on your forehead.

If I go ahead and crush your
Stand's head like a melon,

it looks like your head will be crushed, too.

I'm gonna keep a grip on you for a while.

I'll take you to the old man.

I'm sure he'd love to meet you...

And I'd like to know more about DIO myself.

What?

Green fluid is coming out of his Stand's hands?

I already told you, Jojo...

That you would regret this.

Feel the attack of my Stand, Hierophant Green!

Don't make any weird moves!

Emerald Splash!

What do you think?

Emerald Splash...

What looked like the bodily fluids
of my Stand, Hierophant Green,

was a vision of destructive energy!

It's pierced through your Stand's chest.

Therefore, your insides
have been torn to shreds.

And that nurse...

Wh-What?

I'm certain that I removed the Stand from her...

I already told you...

Attacking my Hierophant Green
would mean hurting her.

My Stand can reach further than yours,
but it doesn't like open spaces.

It prefers to hide within something.

If you drag it out, it gets angry.

That's why, when it came out
from her throat, it hurt her.

It's your fault, Jojo!

This is your responsibility!

This is your fault, Jojo!

You did this!

If you had let me kill you in the first place,
this nurse wouldn't have been hurt.

You're trying to stand up?

But how sad...

If I were to compare you to something,

it'd be a sandbag in front of of a boxer.

You stood back up only to be hit again.

Menacing

I, Jotaro Kujo,

am labeled a punk.

Ramen

I tend to overdo it with my opponents in fights,

so much that some are still in the hospital.

There was one idiot teacher who was all talk,

so I taught him a lesson,
and he hasn't come back to school.

At restaurants that served me lousy food,

I leave without paying the bill all the time.

But...

Even I

know nauseating evil when I see it.

Evil is when you use the
weak for your own gain,

and crush them under your foot.

Especially a woman!

That is exactly what you've done!

Your Stand isn't visible to the
victim or the law. Therefore...

I shall judge you!

Evil?

There, you are wrong.

Evil refers to the loser.

Justice refers to the victor.

The last man standing!

The method doesn't matter!

Grab

The loser is the evil one.

And now, the final blow!

What? The loser is evil?

Emerald Splash!

Well, in that case...

What?!

Impossible! He shrugged off the Emerald Splash?

...you're the evil one after all!

The one who'll be the judge is...

my Stand!

Smash!

What a powerful Stand...

You just caught it by surprise
and hurt its chest a little.

Lucky for me it's not a weak Stand,

but I have a feeling it'll become more violent.

That was close.

She should be fine once her wounds are treated.

What was that? A gas explosion?

It came from the nurse's office!

None of you leave the classroom!

I'll leave the rest to them.

I'm ditching school today.

I've got to have him explain
some things about DIO.

Hierophant Green

Noriaki Kakyoin

Ping

Jotaro's totally thinking
about me at school right now!

I felt like I had a connection
with my son just now.

I'm not thinking about you.

Jotaro!

Wh-What about school? And who is that?

H-He's covered in blood!

D-Don't tell me... you did that?

It's got nothing to do with you.

I'm looking for the Old Man.

Sucks having to find him in such a huge house.

I think your grandfather's in the tea room,

with Mister Avdol.

Oh, Jotaro...

You won't tell me anything.

Even though I... I...

worry about you so much.

But I know that, deep down,

you're a sweet boy.

Hey.

Yes?

You look a little pale this morning.

Are you all right?

Yay! Fine, thank you!

I knew it.

Well, this is no good. It's too late for him.

He's not going to make it.

He'll die in the next few days.

Jotaro, it's not your fault.

Look. The reason that this
man swore loyalty to DIO

and came to kill you...

is right here!

What the hell is that?!

Episode 3: The Curse of DIO

It's too late for him.

He's not going to make it.

He'll die in the next few days.

Jotaro, it's not your fault.

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

Look. The reason that this
man swore loyalty to DIO

and came to kill you...

is right here!

What is that spider-like growth?

You said that's the reason he swore loyalty to DIO?

That is a flesh bud, formed from DIO's own cells.

It connects to his brain.

This tiny little flesh bud was implanted in his brain

to influence his mind.

In other words, that flesh bud is a controller

that draws forth certain feelings.

Charisma!

The feelings that make
soldiers want to obey dictators!

The feelings that make true
believers follow cult leaders!

This young man admired
DIO and swore loyalty to him!

DIO is a charismatic figure,

which means he can sway others

with his overwhelming powers of attraction.

He used that to order this young man,
called Kakyoin, to kill us.

So operate on him and remove it.

The brain is very delicate.

If he were to move while we were extracting it,
we could inflict brain damage.

Jojo.

The following happened four months ago,

in Cairo, Egypt.

I met DIO!

I am a fortune teller by trade.

I have a shop in a souk called Khan el-Khalili.

It was the night of the full moon.

He...

stood quietly on the stairs that
led up to my shop's second floor.

His cold gaze felt as if it was
trying to stealthily pierce my heart.

His golden hair,

his near-transparent alabaster skin,

and his strange sensuality made
it hard to believe he was a man.

I had heard about him from
Mr. Joestar, so I knew immediately

that he was DIO, back from the Atlantic's depths!

I hear that you have powers
that ordinary people don't.

I'd be grateful if you could show them to me.

It was then that I found him truly terrifying.

His words brought such peace to my soul.

They had a dangerous sweetness.

That's exactly why he was terrifying!

Come, Avdol...

Auuuugh!

I ran for my life.

I didn't dare think of fighting him.

I was very lucky.

Because I had heard about
DIO and realized it was him,

I was able to immediately
jump out the window.

I knew the labyrinthine souk below like the
back of my hand, so I was able to escape.

Otherwise, I would have
ended up like this young man,

made into one of his
followers through a flesh bud.

You would have died a few years later,
your brain completely devoured.

Died?

Hold on a minute.

Kakyoin here...

isn't dead yet!

Bang

I'll pull it out using my Stand!

Wait, Jotaro!

Old man, don't touch me!

I'll pull it out without harming his brain.

My Stand moves with such precision
that it can grasp even a bullet.

Stop! That flesh bud is alive!

Don't you realize why part of
the flesh bud is outside of his body?

That's why not even the
best surgeon could extract it!

Shit!

The flesh bud stabbed him with a tentacle!

This isn't good! Let go, Jojo!

It will try to enter the brain of
anyone who tries to extract it!

You...

Don't move, Kakyoin.
If I fail, your brain is done for.

Let go, Jojo! It's gone up to your face!

Wait, Avdol!

My grandson is quite the man.

It's entered his body,
and yet he's completely calm.

He isn't even trembling. Nor is his Stand!

He moves with more precision
and strength than I anticipated.

He did it!

Overdrive!

Wh...

Why?

Why did you risk your life to save me?

Who knows?

I'm not really sure myself.

Mama sees right through you, Jotaro.

First Aid Kit

And done.

Thank you... very much.

Kakyoin, wasn't it?

You should rest for a while.

Stay the night tonight.

Huh? Um...
Papa, please get his futon ready.

Why do I have to do that?!

I've never even liked the
idea of sleeping on the floor!

Holly, replace the futon
in my room with a real bed!

Papa, you're in Japan,
so please just get used to

the Japanese way of doing things.

Oh, and call me "Seiko."

What?!

Holly comes from the word "Holy,"
which is "Seinaru" in Japanese.

So all my friends call me "Seiko."

What the hell is that?!

"Holly" is the wonderful name I gave you mys—

If you don't call me "Seiko"
from now on, I won't answer.

Holly!

Does it hurt, Kakyoin?

I-I'm fine.

Holly!

Good grief...

All right, Kakyoin, take off your uniform.

Huh?

Come on, now.

Holly!

Hmph.

Holly! Hey, Holly.

Hey, where are you?

Take a good look. These are Jotaro's pants.

Where are mine?

The size is just right, but I can't wear these!

Hey, Holly!

Oh, I have to call her "Seiko"
or she won't come out?

No, my daughter is Holly.
Holly! Answer me!

I'm definitely going to go to school today.

That's weird...

Here, a goodbye kiss.

Smooch.

That's usually how it plays out...

Menacing

Bam!

Ms...

Ms. Holly!

Ms. Holly! Ms. Holly!

She's got a really high fever...

Is she sick?

This is... It can't be!

P-Pardon...

H-How can this be?

It's intangible...

It's a Stand!

A Stand has manifested
from Ms. Holly, as well!

Hermit Purple

Joseph Joestar

Ms. Holly has a Stand, too.

B-But this high fever...
The Stand is causing her harm.

We thought that only Jojo and Mr. Joestar
were being affected by DIO's body,

and were relieved that Ms. Holly was unaffected.

No, we merely wanted to be relieved.

But there's no way she could be unaffected.

Anyone who has the blood of
the Joestar family in their veins

should be affected by DIO.

But...

Stands are controlled by a person's mental strength,

and move with their fighting instincts.

Ms. Holly is very gentle and peaceful.

She therefore lacks the
strength to withstand DIO's curse.

She has no power to move her Stand.

That's why her Stand is moving
against her and harming her!

This isn't good at all. At this rate...

She'll die!

She'll be killed!

Menacing

A S-Stand...

Holly...

Smash

This... This is the one thing I feared most!

M-My daughter finally has a Stand.

I knew she didn't have
the power to withstand it.

I knew she didn't have the power
to deny the curse from DIO's soul.

Tell me how we should deal with this!

There's only one way.

We need to find DIO!

We need to kill DIO and lift the curse!
That's all we can do!

Bam

But...

No matter how many times I try,
he hides in the darkness.

In every spirit photo I take,
the background is darkness!

I cannot find out where he
is with my spirit photos.

We've used various means to analyze them,
but with this darkness, it always failed.

You should've told me that in the first place.

I might be able to find out where

Bang

that darkness or whatever is!

Did you see something in the space behind DIO?

My Stand is able to move with

such accuracy that it could
extract a flesh bud from his brain,

and with such precision that it can grasp a bullet.

Let's have him sketch.

Whoosh

Whoosh

A fly! A fly was in that space!

But a fly won't help us at all—

Wait a moment!

I've seen this fly before!

What?!

Jojo, do you have an encyclopedia?

We've got a library.

I'll take the memo.

And I'll go investigate.

Holly!

Papa, I...

Just rest. Jotaro, get some water.

You seem to be doing well.

Sorry, but I'm a little busy right now.

Is it really possible for your own Stand to kill you?

It is. In the past, I have seen
many people suffer that fate.

Right now, it's just her back,

but eventually that Stand,
growing like a fern,

will slowly bind Ms. Holly's entire body.

She will suffer high fevers and various illnesses,

fall into a coma from which she'll never awaken,

and die.

A normal human

would die of something unseen and unknown,

and no skilled doctor would
be able to treat them.

No one, not you nor I,
can do anything about it.

But there is still hope.

It will take fifty days for
her to reach that state.

We will find and defeat DIO before that.

If we are able to destroy
the connection to DIO's Stand,

we can save her!

Thank you, Jotaro.

Really, I wonder what's wrong with me...

I can't believe I took fever and passed out.

But...

I feel better now.
She hasn't realized what happened,
since it's coming from her back.

You gave me quite the scare, Holly.

Come now. You've got to
brush your teeth now that you're up.

Say, "ahh."

Ahh...

We've got to wash your face...

Your hair is a mess, too.

Then we'll take care of your nails...

Ahh...

Ahh...

Papa, help me change my underwear, too.

I'm kidding! It was a joke!

Now, then, what do you want
to eat for dinner, Jotaro?

H-Hey...

Don't move! Just stay in bed!

I-I'm saying that you shouldn't do
anything until your fever goes down.

Just shut up and get better soon.

Holly, come on...

You're right.

You're all so nice when I'm sick.

Sometimes having a cold isn't so bad.

H-Holly!

Sh-She lost consciousness again.

She's acting cheerful, but she's burning up.

The way she acted confirms it.

Though she hasn't said anything,
my daughter is aware of her Stand.

She was actually trying to hide her Stand from us.

She was trying not to worry us!

That's what kind of person my daughter is.

Mr. Joestar, I've found it!

That fly is...

Nile
Nile Ue Ue Fly (Male)

This.

The Nile Ue Ue Fly.

It dwells only within the Nile River Basin.

The ones with the stripes
on their legs are known

as Aswan Ue Ue Flies.

Egypt!

And we've narrowed it
down to the Aswan area.

DIO is there!

So it is Egypt...

Kakyoin.

What do you mean by that?

The flesh bud was planted in
my brain three months ago.

When my family was on vacation in
Egypt visiting the Nile, I met DIO.

You were in Egypt, too?

It appears that, for some reason,
DIO doesn't want to leave Egypt.

When are you going?

I'll go with you.

Go with us? Why would you?

About that...

I'm not sure why I suddenly
want to join you, either.

I've regained my senses because of you.

That's all.

Holly... we'll save you, no matter what.

Don't worry.

There's nothing to worry about...

We'll make you better.

You just take it easy.

Jojo's mother, Ms. Holly, is a woman
who can calm the hearts of others.

People feel at ease when she is nearby.

This may sound awkward,

but if I were to fall in love, I'd like
it to be with someone like her.

I'd feel like I have to protect her.

I'd want to see her happy, kind smile.

Indeed.

There's no time. We're leaving immediately.

They're doctors from the Speedwagon
Foundation. We can trust them.

They will take care of Holly around the clock.

Jojo, before we leave, since I am a
fortune teller, I shall name your Stand.

Name?

With the cards of fate, the Tarot.

Choose a card blindly and it shall be decided.

This will suggest your fate,

as well as suggest your Stand's power.

The Star! The Star card!

Then I shall name your Stand...

Star Platinum!

As I anticipated...

They have figured out my location.

Will you come here to Egypt?

Joseph and Jotaro...

He saw us.

I definitely felt DIO looking at us just now.

Yeah.

Be careful.

The next Stand user may
already be on this plane.

We've already found the next Stand user!

Impossible! It's faster than Star Platinum!

What?

It writhes in pain when torn apart.

Wow... He's so handsome!

There is an emotion called fear.

It's a very natural emotional
reaction found in all animals.

Why does fear occur?

There is the fear caused by animal instincts,

and the fear born of logical thought.

Namely, when you encounter
something stronger than yourself

and realize that you have no way of facing it,

or when you encounter something unknown.

Something as simple as
"not knowing" can evoke fear.

When faced with fear,
you have a number of choices.

You might struggle, resist, flee,
accept, or many other things.

But upon meeting Lord DIO,
a new reaction arises...

Joy!

How do people act once they feel joy in fear?

He is currently on the plane
that Joestar and the others are on.

They will not reach their destination safely.

A... a rhinoceros beetle?

No...

A stag beetle!

Avdol, is that a Stand?

Are we already encountering
another Stand user?

It is very possible.

It could be a bug-shaped Stand.

It hid in the shadow of the seats...

Wh-Where did it go?

Jojo! It's on the side of your head!

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
Stardust Crusaders

Episode 4: Tower of Gray

I-It's huge! It has to be a Stand.

That bug is a Stand!

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

It's disgusting...

But leave this to me.

B-Be careful.

I've heard there is a user of a bug Stand
that likes to rip out the tongues of its victims.

Star Platinum!

I-It dodged!

I-I can't believe it!

It's faster than Star Platinum,
whose speed and precision

are such that it can grasp bullets.

It has to be a Stand.
That bug is a Stand!

Where is he? Where is he hiding?!

Where is the one who's controlling it?!

I-It's attacking!

No!

Jotaro!

Jojo!

Luckily, it could stop the spirit beetle's
mouth needle with its teeth, but...

Since it tried to bite off Jotaro's Stand's tongue...

It must be him!

The Tower card of the Tarot...

The one that depicts a Stand suggesting

destruction, calamity,
and the end of a journey:

Tower of Gray.

Tower of Gray commits mass murders,

making them look like accidents.

The airplane crash that happened last year

in England, causing 300 deaths,

is thought to have been its work.

I had heard rumors,
but it seems he's working with DIO!

I-It dodged it.

Not just the single hand,

but it also dodged a two-fisted rush of blows.

I-It's so fast...

Even if you were to have ten guns
shoot bullets from one centimeter away,

they would not be able to touch my Stand!

And you couldn't kill my
Stand with a bullet anyway.

He has to be nearby!

Who is it?

Where's the one controlling the Stand?

Which one of the passengers is he?

If we can track him down...

It disappeared again.

It moved over there!

What's it planning to do?

I-It can't be!

Burst

Bingo!

Got their tongues!

And my objective...

Massacre!

This word's meaning: to kill everyone!

I-It actually did it...

I will burn it to death!

Magician's Red!

Wait! Wait a moment, Avdol!

It's so noisy...

I wonder what all the ruckus is...

Look out!

I guess I'll go to the bathroom.

What's this slimy stuff?

M... A...

I-Is it blood?! Blood!

Atemi.

We have to defeat it before
the other passengers panic.

But, Avdol,

an active Stand like your Magician's Red

could make the plane explode.

And Jojo, if your power were to put a
hole in the fuselage, it'd be a catastrophe.

My quiet Stand,

Hierophant Green,
is most suited to defeating it.

Noriaki Kakyoin, eh?

I've heard all about you from Lord DIO.

Stop.

If you know that your Stand is quiet,
there's no point in challenging me.

You cannot catch me with your speed.

Fwish

You think so?

Emerald Splash!

Emerald Splash!

You seem to think you can
hit me if you fire enough shots,

but you haven't hit me at all!

This isn't good. It's still dodging with its speed!

K-Kakyoin!

My speed is on an entirely different level.

You're way too slow to get a bingo.

And Kakyoin...

With my next attack,
I'll stab your Stand's tongue with

this Tower Needle, and rip it out!

Emerald Splash!

Don't you get it?

Th-This isn't good!
It dodged Emerald Splash again!

Once this rips your tongue out, you'll go mad...

From the pain!

What? If its tongue is ripped out,
it'll go mad from the pain?

My Hierophant Green?

What?!

If it rips you apart, it'll go mad, all right...

From joy!

Hierophant's appendages had
already slipped beneath the sheet.

Didn't you realize I was trapping
you there with Emerald Splash?

So that geezer was the user?

A repulsive Stand usually has a repulsive user.

It doesn't appear that he has
DIO's flesh bud in his forehead...

From the start, Tower of Gray was
an evil Stand that killed tourists,

making it look like an
accident only in return for pay.

I'm sure DIO was able to
use him because he was

easily bought, and blinded by greed.

Something's wrong.

I could be imagining it, but it seems
like the plane is flying crooked.

It is crooked.

I-It can't be!

Sir, where are you going?

The cockpit is up ahead,
so passengers may not enter.

I know that.

S-Sir!

My! What a handsome man.

Move, bitch.

What a shock!

Whoa, there.

Pardon.

It is inexcusable of him to treat
women in such a cruel manner...

But this is an emergency.

Please forgive him.

Okay...

This is awful!

Bam!

We've been had!

Their tongues have been ripped out.

That stag beetle bastard!

He had already killed the pilots?

It's falling.

The autopilot's been destroyed, as well.

This plane's going to crash!

Splat

What?

I am the Stand that holds The Tower card

which suggests accidents
and the end of a journey.

You will not reach Lord DIO!

Even if you survive this crash,
you are 10,000 kilometers from Egypt!

Those who swore loyalty to Lord DIO
will pursue you every hour of every day!

There are Stands in this world
that you can't even imagine.

Lord DIO is the master of Stands!

Lord DIO has the power to
reign over all of them.

There's no way you'll reach him!

You bastards will never reach Egypt!

You're definitely professionals.

It's a good thing you didn't scream.
That would've been annoying.

Now, I've got a request.

This old man is now going to
emergency land this plane on the water.

Go put life jackets and seat belts
on all of the other passengers.

G-Got it!

Old man.

Well... I have experience
with propeller planes, but...

Propellers?

But, Jotaro... this is my third time.

Have you ever heard of someone being in a

crashing plane three times?

I'm never...

I'm never riding in a plane with you again.

Tower of Gray

Gray Fly

The plane landed 35 kilometers
off the Hong Kong coast.

Jotaro and the others had no
choice but to head to Hong Kong.

Today, a jumbo jet made an emergency landing

35 kilometers south of Hong Kong,
near Lamma Island.

Efforts are underway
to rescue all passengers.

Hong Kong!

Hong Kong Island! Kowloon! The New Territories!

With more than 235 islands in the area,

— Hong Kong —

the view of the area at night is
known as the "Million Dollar View."

Right. That's fine.

Please make sure the only
ones aboard are us and the crew.

Right. We don't want any more victims.

Also...

Hey, big guy!

Are you guys tourists?

Want some rice porridge?

If you're in Hong Kong,
you gotta try dim sum or rice porridge.

We have hot cola, too.

Rice porridge, eh? Not bad.

Did you know, Jojo?

Unlike in Japan, rice porridge
is a staple food in Hong Kong.

I'll have it the popular way,
with pork and a century egg.

Coming right up!

Then I'll have—

Hey!

What are you guys trying to eat?

We're going to go to my friend's shop.

Hey, dandy guy. Want to try
some Hong Kong hot cola?

Hot?!

Everybody knows that
cola's supposed to be cold.

Old man, who were you calling?

Hm? Oh, I'll explain everything
when we get to the shop.

We need to work out a plan that'll get us
to Egypt as safely and quickly as possible.

A plan?

Mr. Joestar, we cannot allow any
more innocent civilians to be hurt.

The quickest way would be by plane, but...

Indeed.

It's now become impossible
for us to fly to Egypt.

If we encounter another Stand user
like the last one on a commercial flight,

we're sure to cause a disaster
that will harm many people.

We'll have to get to Egypt by either land or sea.

But if we fail to meet DIO within fifty days...

If we had stayed on that plane,

we'd probably be in Cairo by now.

I'm aware of that.

But it's too soon to worry about it.

A hundred years ago,
Jules Verne wrote a story in which

the protagonist traveled around the world

in 80 days, traveling 40,000 kilometers.

That was in the age of trains and steamboats.

Even without a plane, in fifty days,

we'll be able to travel
the 10,000 kilometers to Egypt.

As for the route...

I say we go by sea.

We'll charter a suitably-sized boat,

go around the Malay peninsula,
and cross the Indian Ocean.

It'll be the Silk Road of the sea.

I believe that is best, as well.

If we go by land, borders will be a hassle.

And we'd have to cross
the Himalayas and a desert.

If we ran into trouble,
we'd lose a great deal of time.

There are too many dangers.

I haven't been to any of
those places using either route,

so I can't say anything.

I'll leave it up to you two.

Same.

Then it's decided.

The greatest danger will be

the Stand users that DIO sends against us.

We'll have to do our best to get
to Egypt without being spotted.

This is a sign to let them
know we want more tea.

If you do this in Hong Kong,
they'll bring you seconds.

Also, when they pour tea into your cup...

This means "thank you."

Excuse me, do you have a moment?

I'm a tourist from France,

and I'm having a hard time
with the kanji on the menu.

Would you please help me out?

You're annoying. Go away.

Come now, Jotaro. It's fine.

I've been to Hong Kong many times,

so I can at least read the kanji on the menu.

Why don't you join us?

So, what did you want to order?

Food with shrimp, duck,
sharkfin, and mushrooms?

We'll have this, this, this...

And this, too.

Oh, and this.

Gong

This looks like food with beef,
fish, clams, and frog, but...

Roasted Frog        Rice Porridge
Clam Dish                                                    Stewed Fish

Indeed. This is rather different.

I knew this would happen.

Well, it doesn't matter.

It's on me!

It doesn't matter what you order.
It's all delicious!

All right, everyone, dig in.

Wow, this is...

Well? It's pretty good, isn't it?

Well, they've certainly taken
a lot of time to prepare this.

Look, these carrots...

They're shaped like stars.

It reminds me of something...

That's right.

Someone I know has this
exact mark on their neck...

Menacing

You...

Are you another...

Mr. Joestar, look out!

It's a Stand!

Magician's Red!

What?!

Another Stand user!

H-His sword is so fast...

My Stand holds The Chariot card!

Silver Chariot!

Mohammed Avdol,
it appears that you want to die first.

I've made a fire clock on that table!

I will kill you by the time
that clock burns to twelve!

Would you like to be friends with me?

Something is bothering you.

Stick with me,
and it'll disappear from your heart.

That left arm is not a right arm.

fortune-telling to fight a fortune teller...

Your sword is terrifyingly fast.

It's amazing, but do you really think

you'll defeat me by the time
the flames on that table strike 12?

Aren't you being rather conceited,

Mister...?

Polnareff.

Allow me to introduce myself.

Jean Pierre Polnareff.

Merci beaucoup.

I appreciate your introduction.

But...

Monsieur Polnareff,

don't assume that my flames

always burn upward or downwind
as they would in nature.

It is called Magician's Red
because it controls flames freely.

In the beginning, this world
was engulfed in flames.

I expect nothing less from Magician's Red,

who controls the flames that
suggest the beginning of all things.

But, you say I'm being conceited?

You're saying that my swordsmanship

is mere conceit?!

Foom

In the moment they lined up,
he pierced five coins in a single strike!

No. Take a closer look.

That's...

I-I see... there are flames between each coin.

It appears you understand what this means.

It is not conceit.

My Stand has the power to sever even fire!

It can slash the very air and create gaps
between nothingness and nothingness.

Which means your Magician's Red is
powerless before my Silver Chariot.

When did he...

The card that my Stand has,

The Chariot, suggests conquest and victory.

I don't mind taking care of you
in this cramped little space,

but, Avdol, you'd be able to use your

flame abilities in a much more open space, no?

It would be fitting for my Stand to
defeat you under those circumstances.

A fitting victory.

All of you, outside!

Episode 5: Silver Chariot

Wh-What is this place?

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

It's Tiger Balm Garden.

What?

Tiger Balm Garden,

a garden that exists along the hillside
of Hong Kong's Tai Hang Road.

Its unique taste and appearance

make it number one among
Hong Kong's bizarre zones.

I will make a prediction here.

First, Avdol,

you will be destroyed by
your own Stand's powers.

Avdol...

Jotaro, you need not interfere.

With such an open space,

I can control my Stand as freely as I please.

Come on!

Slice

Come on! Come on! Come on!

Come on. What's wrong?

You're not going to use your precious
flames to your heart's content?

If not, I'm going to take my turn.

Come on! Come on! Come on!

That bastard. He's mocking us.

With repeated stabs, he carved a
statue that looks just Magician's Red.

You know...

You fit quite well in this garden, Magician's Red.

Suuuuuck

Here it comes.

You're ready to show your true power?

Sounds like fun.

I'll take what you dish out.

Hey, hide behind something.

Avdol is going to use it.

"It"?

Crossfire Hurricane!

Is that all you've got?!

I told you that my swordsmanship can create gaps

between nothingness and nothingness,
and blow away flames!

Crash

Avdol!

The flames are so strong
that he's being burned, as well.

It's just as I predicted.

You will die, burned by your own flames!

Oh, good, good grief!

You're still going to come at me?

How unsightly!

What is this odd resistance?

What?!

Impossible!

How can flames come out
from the body I severed?

That's not the Stand.

It's the statue!

Your eyes were blinded by the flames.

What you cut apart was the statue
that Silver Chariot carved earlier.

I told you that I could control my flames freely.

The flames that you blew back toward it

melted its joints and caused it to move.

You are the one defeated
by his own Stand's powers.

And now, face this again!

Crossfire Hurricane!

I believe it's ten years too
soon for you to fight me,

a fortune teller, with predictions.

Such terrifying power!

Since his Stand took that head-on,
it must have melted. It's done for!

That's one hell of a burn.

Yeah, he's dead. If he's lucky,
he'll be in serious condition.

Actually, that'd be bad luck.

Either way, he won't be
able to stand for three months.

His Stand is destroyed and unable to fight.

Now, Mr. Joestar,

let us hurry on our journey to Egypt.

Indeed.

Boom

Wh-What?

His Stand is breaking into pieces!

Bang

He flew into the air while still lying down!

Bravo! Oh, bravo!

H-He's...

I don't believe it!

He's perfectly fine!

But why is his body floating in the air?

Take a good look with your inner eye.

That's...

Bam

Yes, this is it.

My Stand with its armor off: Silver Chariot.

You seem shocked,

and it wouldn't be honorable to defeat you

without explaining my powers first.

You could even call it a surprise attack.

Would you give me the time to explain?

Very well.

Let's hear this explanation.

My Stand did not break apart and disappear.

Silver Chariot was wearing armor.
That's what it just took off.

What was burned away by your
flames was just part of its armor.

That's why I was only lightly injured.

And with its armor off, it is lighter.

Did you see it lift me up?

That's right. That's how fast it can move now!

I see.

So you're saying that because
its armor was so heavy,

it had to take my Crossfire Hurricane head-on.

But that would also mean that it's naked now.

Now that it doesn't have its protection,

if it were to take that attack
again, it wouldn't survive.

Oui, precisely.

But that would be impossible.

Impossible? I'd like to test that theory.

Because I'm going to show
you something astonishing.

Oh? Go right ahead.

Line-up

Wh-What?!

His Stand just multiplied into six...
no, now there are seven of them!

I-Impossible.

There should only be one Stand to each user.

It seems that you are astonished.

These are shadow clones.

Shadow clones of my Stand that confuse
not only your eyes, but your senses.

Your senses can't follow its movements.

How do you like its swordsmanship now?

Silver Chariot

Jean Pierre Polnareff

Red Bind!

I told you that you wouldn't be
able to follow its movements.

Your flames can only grasp shadow clones.

Striking at random now?

You're getting a bit desperate, Avdol.

It's true; that'll just use up all his energy.

Crossfire Hurricane!

Non, non, non, non, non, non.

That is also a shadow clone.

Your attack will not work against my Stand.

Come on, come on, come on!

Avdol!

Such precision. Th-This is...

a Stand ability that has
been very highly trained.

For certain reasons,
I trained for nearly ten years.

Now, come at me again.

I will finish you with my next move.

In the name of chivalry,
you keep explaining your attacks.

You're rather honorable.

Therefore, I shall also

reveal a secret before beginning my next attack.

Oh?

You see, there are variations
to my Crossfire Hurricane.

It is a flame in the shape of an Ankh,
but it need not be singular.

I can break it up and make it fly in pieces.

Crossfire Hurricane

Special!

Just try and dodge it!

You waste your time, Avdol!

They formed a circle!

There's no opening!

Naïve! Naïve, naïve, naïve, naïve!

You're naïve!

I will again use this power against you!

Sever! Blow it back at him!

What?!

Kaboom

That's...

The hole that was made by the flames earlier...

I get it!

The first flames were used to dig a tunnel!

And then he shot the Crossfire Hurricane through it!

I told you.

I can break apart my flames

and make them fly in as many pieces as I wish.

Burning is a rather painful way to die.

Use that dagger to kill yourself.

I was conceited.

I couldn't imagine his flames

standing a chance against my swordsmanship.

I'll be a good sport and burn to death after all.

Since I was defeated by your powers,
it is only due courtesy.

It would be disrespectful to kill myself.

Even now, you remember to be chivalrous.

And you did not throw your
dagger when I had my back turned.

Despite having orders from DIO,
your proud honor shines through.

It would be a shame to kill you.

There must be a reason behind his actions...

Jojo!

Yeah.

Ugh. Those tentacles are so gross!

Jotaro, hurry up and get it out.

Shut up, old man.
Hurry! Hurry!

Good! Now that the flesh bud is gone,

we can be buddies. Ta-da!

Kakyoin, don't guys like him
who make stupid puns

seriously piss you off?

The boat that we had chartered
from the Speedwagon crew

yesterday should be at the harbor now.

What's wrong? Is there
something else you needed,

Polnareff?

I haven't thanked you for
freeing me from DIO's spell yet.

For that, you need to thank Jojo.

Don't need it.

It appears there's no one
to accept your kind thanks.

All right. I don't like to be pushy, either.

But there is something else.

Monsieur Joestar, I'd like to ask
you a very bizarre question.

A bizarre question?

Forgive my curiosity,

but even while eating,
you didn't take off your gloves.

Your left arm wouldn't happen
to be a right arm, would it?

What? My left arm, a right arm?

That is indeed a bizarre question.

What do you mean?

I'm looking for the man
who killed my younger sister.

I don't know his face.

But he has two right arms.

I lost it in a battle fifty years ago.

I apologize for my rudeness. Please forgive me.

If you don't mind, tell us what happened.

It's been three years now...

My younger sister was walking home from school

with a classmate one rainy day.

It was a country road in my native France.

On the side of the road, a man stood

with his back to them.

Mysteriously, even though it was raining,

the rain fell around him in a dome-like shape,

as if an invisible screen surrounded him.

Suddenly, as if cut down by a scythe,

her classmate's chest was sliced open.

And then...

My sister was shamed and killed.

That was all that man wanted.

Barely escaping death,
her friend somehow survived.

She said that she didn't see his face,

but both of his arms were right arms.

No one believed her testimony,
but I understood it!

Because I believed that man
may have a similar power to the

one that I had been keeping a secret.

He's definitely a Stand user.

I swore!

My sister's soul would not be able

to rest unless he atoned with his death!

I will use my Stand for retribution!

Menacing

Then, a year ago, I met DIO.

Blam

I see s-something in the crystal ball.

It's...

A vision. I didn't create it.

What's inside your heart is
being projected via my powers.

How about it?

Would you like to be friends with me?

Something is bothering you. You're in pain.

Stick with me,
and it'll disappear from your heart.

What's being shown in the
crystal is what pains you, yes?

Let me help you.

I have pain of my own...

My body cannot go out into the sunlight.

So please, help me, as well.

I shall find this man for you.

And then I was ordered to kill you.

I believed that was the right thing to do.

It's partially because of the flesh bud,

but DIO's also skilled at manipulating others.

Indeed. But according to what you just said,

it would appear that DIO has
found the man with two right arms

and has joined forces with him.

I've decided to go to Egypt with all of you!

If I go after DIO,

I'll be able to find the
one who took my sister's life!

What should we do?

I have no objections.

I'm sure you'd follow us, even if we said no.

Jean Pierre Polnareff.

Jean Pierre Polnareff

Stand name: Silver Chariot.

Silver Chariot

Powers: Fast and precise swordsmanship!

It's an honor.

Good grie—

Excuse me!

Would you mind taking our picture?

He's amazing.

I'm going to use this as my chance.

Thank you!

We want our backs toward the ocean.

You're annoying me! Ask someone else!

Now, now, now, now...

I'll take your picture for you.

Come, come.

You have very nice legs.
Let's get a full body shot.

Ooh, nice!

I'm going to take one more.

Très bien!

Just like the button,

I want to push, push, push
your hearts toward mine!

I don't quite understand his personality.

That was a very sudden change of mood.

More like his head and his lower
half are very clearly separated.

Good grief.

To get from Hong Kong to Singapore,

we'll be on the water for three full days.

Well, let's relax and keep our spirits up.

But seriously, guys...

Can't you do something
about those school uniforms?

You're going to continue
our journey wearing those?

Isn't it ridiculously hot?

Well, we are students...

And students should behave as students.

But I suppose that sounds like a stretch...

Hmph.

Hmph! Japanese students are such stiffs.

I see... so this is Bushido.

Once you clear your mind,
even fire seems cool.

But you know, girls won't fall for stiffs like you.

Let go! Let go of me! You big lug!

Shut up!

Damn it, let me go! Let me go!

What a little brat.

Hey, what's going on?

I thought we agreed there'd
be no passengers on our boat.

Let go!

I'm sorry. It's a stowaway.

This brat was hiding in storage down below.

A stowaway?

Come at me if you're gonna!

I'll kick your balls in!

I'll turn you in to the naval police.

What? The police?!

P-Please. Let me go!

I just want to go see my dad in Singapore.

I'll do anything!
You can work me as hard as you want!

Let's see. What should I do?

Should I let you go?

What should I do?

P-Please!

What should I do?

Ow!
I'm not gonna let you go after all. Hell no.

First, I'm gonna go let the
Captain know, so come wit—

Whoa! He jumped in! Talk about energetic.

Is he planning to swim to shore from here?

What should we do?

Just leave 'im.

I'm sure he dove in because
he's a confident swimmer.

Th-This isn't good!
Sharks gather around these parts!

This isn't good!

Hey, you brat! Come back!

Get back here! It's dangerous!

There are sharks!
Those waters are shark-infested!

Huh?

Crack!

Good grief, you little brat.

You're...

A girl?

And a little runt of one, at that.

H-How dare you grab my chest like that?!

Damn it!

Good grief.

J-Jotaro! Below you!

Something's attacking from underwater!

It's not a shark! It's really fast!

Jotaro! Hurry!

Hurry and swim to the boat!

I-It's too far.

If it's at that distance, leave it to me.

Hierophant Green!

I-It disappeared! It's a Stand!

That thing is a Stand!

A seafaring Stand...

I don't believe I've ever
even heard of such a thing.

This girl... Sh-She couldn't be...

Could she be that Stand's user?

Could she have led Jojo into the
shark-infested ocean on purpose?

Wh-What's with you jerks,

all glaring at me like that?!

I don't know what's going on,

but do you want a fight?!

Don't underestimate me! I'll take you on!

One-on-one!

Face me, one-on-one!

You little shits!

She can't be serious.

Maybe we should toss
her back into the ocean.

Don't be rash.

If she was really an ordinary stowaway,

she'd have been eaten by sharks.

I've already checked the
ten people on this boat.

I don't know who it could be,
other than this girl.

Isn't there a way we can
find out who she really is?

Hey, how's DIO doing?

DIO? What the hell is that?

Don't act like you don't know,
you little brat!

You damn punks!

Do you want to talk to me,
or do you want to get stabbed?

Which is it?!

This demon's blade is telling me that it wants

the blood of its 340th victim already.

What's so funny, you stupid grunt?!

Grunt?

You know, I really don't think it's her.

Yes, but...

So is this girl our stowaway?

Captain.

I'm pretty harsh when it comes to stowaways.

O-Ow... Ow...

You may be a girl,
but if I go easy on you,

we'll just get more and more stowaways.

We're gonna hold you in

one of the rooms below
deck until we get to port.

Captain, I'd like to ask you something.

You've verified the identities of
all ten of the men on board, right?

Of course.

All of them are veterans
who have been on this boat

for over ten years.

I'm not sure why you're so worried about that.

By the way...

I request that you refrain
from smoking aboard this ship.

What did you plan to do with the
ashes and butt after you're done?

Were you planning on throwing
it into the beautiful ocean?

You're a guest on this ship,
but I'll have you follow her rules,

Mr. Outlaw.

Got it?

Hold it.

If you're going to put it out, just put it out.

Don't be a condescending
prick about it, you jackass.

Hey, Jotaro! Don't be rude to the captain!

You're the one at fault.

I'm very aware that I'm being rude.

He isn't the captain... I just figured it out.

He's the Stand user!

Wh...

What?!

Sta... nd?

What might that be...?

That's inconceivable, Jotaro.

Captain Dragon came recommended with
verification by the Speedwagon Foundation.

He's someone we should trust.

There is a 0% chance that he's a Stand user.

Hold on, a Stand? I have no
idea what you're talking about...

Jojo, random guesses will only
make things more confusing!

Do you have any proof, Jojo?

I've found a way to differentiate
Stand users from other people.

What?!

That is...

If a Stand user inhales even a
little bit of cigarette smoke,

a vein pops up on the tip of their nose.

What the hell are they all doing?

You can't be serious, Jotaro!

Yeah, I'm lying.

But it looks like we've found the idiot.

Menacing

Jotaro, how did you know he was suspicious?

Actually, I didn't think he was at all.

Huh?

But I planned to try this
with all of the men on board.

You're cold. Damn, but you're cold.

You're right. I'm not the captain.

The real captain is already sleeping with the

fishes at the ocean's bottom back in Hong Kong.

Then you can sleep at the bottom of Hell!

Grab

Damn it!

Splash

I-I can't move...

Trouble on the water!
Lies and betrayal!

The Moon card, which suggests
fear of the unknown.

Its name: Dark Blue Moon!

If I tried to take five of you at once,
even I'd break a bone or two,

so I was going to hide my identity
and take care of you one by one...

But if you've figured me out,
I guess I have no choice.

I'll have to take on all five of you!

Getting my hands on this girl is a sign

that my luck is changing for the better!

I'm going to jump into these
shark-infested waters with her.

Of course, you guys will end up following us in.

If we fight in the water,

where I have the advantage,
I can beat all five of you.

Don't underestimate me by taking a hostage!

Don't think that I, Jotaro Kujo,
will be shaken by this!

Underestimate? No, this is a prediction!

I hear that your Stand,
Star Platinum, is pretty damn fast.

I'm not trying to brag,

but my Dark Blue Moon
is pretty fast in the water.

It can swim more elegantly
than any fish in the sea!

Why don't we test them out?

Follow me... if you're prepared to
choke to death on all the seawater

you're about to swallow.

Crush

H-He attacked faster than we
could fall... That's impossible...

You're the only one who's
going to choke on seawater.

Avdol, say something.

You tried to out-predict me, a fortune teller...

...but it's ten years too early for you.

Star Platinum

Jotaro Kujo

He's drifting away.

He sure talked up his Stand's powers,

but it looks like he was just an idiot.

Jotaro, what's wrong?
Hurry and lift up the girl!

What's wrong, Jotaro?!

D-Damn it... I'm being pulled in...

Th-These are...

Acorn barnacles!
The crustaceans called acorn barnacles!

They're all over Star Platinum's
arm and on the side of the boat!

He's still planning on fighting.

He attached them to me earlier,
when I hit him.

They keep multiplying!

My Stand's strength is being drained...

H-He suddenly disappeared.

The captain, he's nowhere to be found!

Jotaro! Bring in your Stand!

I can't,

which is why I'm sweating way
more than I want to right now!

Jojo!
Jotaro!

Shoom

Jojo!

C-Crap!

Th-This isn't good!

Welcome! Welcome!

So you've finally come to where
Dark Blue Moon reigns supreme,

the undersea realm.

It's a bad idea to underestimate me, boy.

Even in the ocean,

the Stands can still communicate, so go ahead.

Try to sound all cocky, like you did earlier.

Go ahead, boy!

So what do you want to be?

Tell me what kind of fish dish you want to be.

Fish cakes? Or maybe sashimi?

I'll make a meal out of your Stand.

You fool... You're trying to sound tough, boy,

but inside, this is what you're thinking:

"How long can he stay underwater?"

"I can probably last about two minutes,

but can he last longer than me?"

Let me answer you.

My lung capacity is three times
greater than a normal person's!

And I've trained them.

My best time underwater is
6 minutes and 21 seconds!

I'm sure you're getting dizzy
just hearing that number.

And!

Dark Blue Moon's fins are

underwater cutters that move
sharper than a ship's propeller!

Before you get overconfident again,

take a good, hard look at your Stand!

The acorn barnacles I attached to it will
keep absorbing your power to propagate.

I'm sure you can feel your power draining away.

Trying to run away by swimming back up?

Take a good look around you!

Haven't you realized that
Dark Blue Moon has been

creating an underwater whirlpool, boy?

Swim! Swim!

It's gonna get harder to breathe,

and your power is still draining!

But it's too early to kill a

self-absorbed little brat like you just yet!

I-It's been too long!
He's still not coming up!

A whirlpool!

There's a giant whirlpool!

Where the hell is Jojo?!

Let's go save him!

Th-These are scales!

Th-That guy's Stand has
scales as sharp as razors!

There are countless scales
swirling in that whirlpool.

He wasn't bluffing when he
said he could beat all five of us.

That whirlpool is like a watery ant lion pit!

It's very possible we could all die if we dive in.

H-His scales?

And now I'm going to guess
what you're thinking next!

"In a whirlpool, only one spot stays still."

So mundane!

"It's the center!"

"If I jump into the center
where he is, I can attack him."

That's what you're thinking, isn't it?

If you think you can hit me
with that punch of yours again,

come at me.

Come at me with your worthless Stand,

its power drained by the acorn barnacles.

See if you can manage an attack

that's even sharper than these
underwater cutters, boy!

C-Curses... It's too reckless to act.

It's Jojo!

I could see Jojo in the whirlpool!

This isn't good!

He was limp!

Limp? He wasn't struggling at all?

That might be a good thing.

What?

How dare you say you were
going to turn me into sashimi?!

The one that's going to be
sliced up like sashimi is...

Star Finger!

Wha...

Slice

The one who was turned
into sashimi was you, after all.

Blub, blub, blub, blub...

What's that? I can't hear you
very well since we're underwater.

Speak up!

But your power was being drained...

You let yourself go limp on purpose

to concentrate your power in your fingers...

Th-That's what you were thinking...

Nope. What I was thinking was...

If you pissed yourself when you lost,

it'd be gross since we're in the water,

old man.

Jojo!

That's my grandson for you!

Well done, Jotaro! Hurry and come u—

Th-That captain had
planted some bombs after all!

Damn it!

Hurry up and get the emergency boats out!

We'll signal a nearby boat for help!

Dark Blue Moon

Fake Captain Dragon

Have some water.

We've sent signals for help,
so someone should be here soon.

I don't know what in the world is
going on, but who are you people?

We're hurrying along a journey, just like you.

Though you're on a journey to see your father,

while I'm on one for my daughter.

Pbbt

Hey! That's our precious water!

How dare you spit it out?!

N-No... E-E...

E-E-E-E-E...

Everyone, look!

What is this boat?

The ramp's down, so why
hasn't anyone shown their face?

There are no signs of life.

I'm all sticky from the salt water...

So that's what this means...

You think you've won...

Enyaba, there's something I'd like to ask you.

What does it mean to live?

To obtain what one desires.

To put it simply, that is all it means to live.

People want money, they want fame,

they want food, they want love,

they want a lover...

But when they attempt to obtain what they desire,

there is always a battle, is there not, Enyaba?

Indeed.

If they lose the battle and
fail to obtain what they desire,

they feel frustration and a sense of failure.

They are hurt...

And they feel fear when
faced with the next battle.

I believe that conquering
fear is what it means to live.

The one who will stand at the top of the world

is the one who feels no fear whatsoever.

Do you understand, Enyaba?

I was the one who told you about

the existence of your Stand and how to use it.

And you have an immortal body.

Is there anything that you fear?

Perhaps.

What concerns you?

The Joestar bloodline.

Joestar? Those two? They are mere trash.

They are no match for your Stand!

Yes...

But when the lives of those trash
are so deeply entangled with my own,

I cannot help but believe it is destiny.

To be more specific...

It is not the Joestars that I fear.

It is the fact that I cannot
underestimate the Joestar bloodline.

I feel that I must rid the
Joestars from my wheel of fortune.

You thought to eliminate them
yourself simply because you feel

that they cannot be underestimated?

Yes.

Foolishness!

You should never engage in such foolishness!

We already have seven Stand users—
The Empress, The Hanged Man,

Strength, The Wheel of Fortune, Temperance,

The Emperor, and The Devil— on the move.

You need not worry about
taking action yourself, Lord DIO.

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
Stardust Crusaders

Episode 7: Strength

Whoa!

A-A freighter!

I didn't see it at all.

Jotaro, what are you concerned about?

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

Do you think there might be

another Stand user on this freighter, too?

No, I was just wondering why

no one's shown themselves,
even though the ramp is down.

They came this far to rescue us!

There has to be someone aboard!

Even if they're all Stand users,
I'm getting on this boat.

Grab on. I'll help you up.

Good grief.

Wh-What's with this boat?!

There's no captain in the pilothouse!

There's no operator in the radio room.

There's no one anywhere!

And yet, look!

All the meters and machines are working properly.

Maybe they're all in the bathroom
with a bad case of diarrhea.

Hey! Isn't anyone around?

Everyone, come over here!

A monkey!

There's a monkey inside that cage.

An orangutan.

Who the hell cares about a monkey?!

Let's split up and find whoever's been feeding it.

Well?

It doesn't appear to be broken, but...

Avdol! That sailor's in danger!

Good grief.

A welcome like this is a bit much for a girl.

B-But no one was touching it...

I saw that crane move, even though
there was no one operating it!

Th-That crane impaled him on its own!

Be careful! There's someone here.

Hey! Don't touch any of the machinery.

If it moves or runs on electricity,
don't lay a finger on it!

If you want to live, follow my orders.

Don't leave the cabin down
below until we say it's okay!

Did anyone see even a
glimpse of a Stand just now?

No...

My apologies...

I was the closest to the crane,
yet I felt nothing.

All right. I will have my
Hierophant Green look around.

I-I have no idea what's going on,

but dangerous things keep happening
when you guys are around.

Are you guys jinxes?

I've heard about people who cause
disasters that endanger everyone,

and that I should avoid them.

Is that what you are?

I have just one bit of truth for you.

We are on your side.

Make sure you stay with the others. Got it?

Okay.

You want me to open the cage?

I can't.

I don't know where the key is, and you're so big.

You're giving me an apple?

But it doesn't make sense...

This apple's been cut with a knife,
and the color hasn't changed yet...

It was just cut.

Hey, so there is someone
somewhere on this boat, right?

Do you know where the
person who feeds you is?

Scratch

Y-You're a pretty smart monkey, aren't you?

Is a monkey like you actually into looking at

pinups of human girls?

Hey, be careful!

They say an orangutan has
five times the strength of a human,

so it could easily rip off your arm.

Come on. Stay with us in the
room on the other side.

Don't go off by yourself.

O-Okay...

It's inconceivable.

I've had Hierophant Green search everywhere,

but I can't find any signs of life.

We've searched every
pipe and crevice, but nothing!

Well?

I-It's no use. I can't get a connection.

Well, try one more time!

I'm all sticky from the salt water...

Hey!

Jojo!

Here's your lock!

This ape... is no ordinary ape.

Could it be that he's...

Slice

I-Is he the one that removed the fan?

So this ape's a Stand user.

But where's the Stand?

Why can't I see it?

What?

The steel propeller bent on its own?

Jojo!

Wh-What is this?

Once again, I can't see the Stand,
and yet the window broke.

Star Platinum!

What's with this thing?

The ape sank into the wall and disappeared!

Hey. You saw that, didn't you?

Stay close to me.

Something bad is going down.

The ape vanished into the wall...

But that orangutan has to be the Stand user...

When I touched it with my hand,

I felt a Stand's energy coming from it.

But why can't I see the Stand?

But... if I can see it, that would mean...

Wh-What?

Wh-What is this?!

C-Crap!

Th-This is...

Is this freighter...

C-Could it be that the ship itself is...

So the Stand is the freighter!

C-Crap!

All of it! Everything!
This ship itself is a gigantic Stand!

The ship?!

There are Stands that people,

like that girl and the crew members
who aren't Stand users, can see?

We would have to assume

that it's because the
energy of its presence is so

enormous and powerful.

But it must demand tremendous
power to operate such a gigantic Stand.

Kakyoin! Use Hierophant
Green and contact Jotaro!

I-I can't!

It's got a firm hold on my Stand.

So this is what it means to face certain doom.

We were already hopelessly ensnared.

The pressure is getting greater...

At this rate, our bodies will be torn apart.

E-Everyone will be...

W-We were careless...

The word that the orangutan
was pointing to was "strength."

It means force, energy, power, or aid.

And... it is the eighth card of the Tarot!

The eighth card of the Tarot. It suggests challenge,
powerful will, and hidden instinct.

It suggests challenge, powerful will,
and hidden instinct!

Ba-Bang

This ape thinks it's already won.

"This ship, the entire thing, is my Stand!"

"You've completely lost!"

"You can't do anything!"

That's what it's saying.

That's what this ape is saying!

That button's not part of your Stand.

You mad?

I guess it wounded your pride,
since you thought you'd already won.

No, it's not hurt...

Because apes don't have any pride!

Graaaa

That's exactly what makes you an ape.

What's going to hurt...

is your head!

Good grief.

I've heard that, when frightened,

animals show their stomachs
to signal that they're giving up.

So you're asking me to forgive you?

But you've already broken
the rules of being an animal.

So I don't think so.

Wham! Wham! Wham!

It's distorting...
The whole ship is twisting up!

Hey. Be surprised later.

This ship's about to sink.

We're gonna get out of here,
by the boats we came in on.

I-I can't believe it.

The ship's shape is changing.

It's turning into such a shoddy little boat...

Unbelievable...

So that monkey used its own
Stand to get this far into the ocean.

What terrifying power.

That was the first time I've
encountered such energy.

We were completely overwhelmed.

If Jotaro hadn't figured it out,
we would have been done for.

But are we going to encounter
even more Stands with

unknown powers from now on?

Want some gum?

So we're going to be drifting again.

Good grief. My cigarettes are soaked.

There'll be plenty of sun and
time for them to get dry, Jojo.

We'll just have to pray that we get
rescued and reach Singapore safely.

Tokyo

It's been four days since we left Japan...

Crash

Hong Kong

Cruiser Sinks

Ghost Ship

Singapore

There are 46 days until the time limit.

Cairo

Strength

Forever

It seems Strength has been defeated.

But have no fear.

The remaining six Stand
users are all very powerful.

And one of them is also my son!

My son's right arm shall take care of them all.

You are a strange old woman.

What is it that you desire?

I have already told you many times...

My wish is to stay by your side.

Your guardian spirit has an
unbelievable amount of power.

Your ability to escape trouble,
and your strange life,

are also the result of that.

I would like to see your life!

That is all...

Once upon a time,

a prince from the land of Sumatra

went out to sea, seeking new lands.

He then found an island where

there were white-maned
lions called Singas,

and so he named the island Singapura.

A country of straits that ships and tankers from

around the world pass through!

A country whose people share

both Western and Eastern heritage
thanks to free trade: Singapore!

Good grief. We're finally here.

We'll stay at a hotel tonight and
figure out our route to Egypt.

All right, let's stay at that hotel.

I guess you guys won't even give us a chance to rest.

She'll be in danger if she stays with us.

And Polnareff fell into that trap?

There...

...is...

...a...

...traitor.

Hey, you!

You! I'm talking to you!

Huh?

You! You threw this trash, didn't you?

That's a fine of five
hundred Singapore dollars!

What? Five hundred?

In Singapore, the law says
you will be fined for littering!

Five hundred Singapore dollars...

That's about 40,000 yen.

Trash?

Got it?

Trash?

What are you talking about?

I don't see anything here
besides my own luggage.

Would you be so kind as to tell me
what trash you're referring to?

Where is this trash, sir?

That's your luggage?

That's right.

I-I'm terribly sorry.

Well, I'll be going, then...

Shoo, shoo.

What's with the kid?
She's still following us.

Hey, weren't you going to go see your father?

Why don't you stop following us and get going?

I'm meeting up with him in five days.

I can go wherever I want!

I'm not taking orders from you guys.

She'll be in danger if she stays with us.

Maybe she doesn't have any money.

All right...

I guess we can pay for her hotel room.

Polnareff, bring her,
but don't hurt her pride.

Got it.

Hey!

You're poor, right?

We'll pay for you, so come with us.

Well then, let us check in...

R-Right...

I'm terribly sorry, but we are
rather full at this time of year.

The rooms won't be next to each other.
Is that all right?

Well, I guess we don't have a choice.

Then for the rooms...

Avdol and I will share a room...

Jotaro and I will share a room,
since we're both students.

That would mean the last
room would be Polnareff and...

You're joking! Like I'd room with him!

What?

Well, she is a child, but also a lady...

Could you make it four rooms?

Yes.

Hmph! I can relax more in my own room anyway!

Nothing would suit me better!

Let's go.

We've been through hell since we left Hong Kong.

Let's hurry up and take a shower where it's safe.

See ya!

I guess you guys aren't going
to give us a chance to rest...

Come out.

Episode 8: Devil
Thrum

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

That's some sharp killing intent you've got there.

Why don't you let me know your name

before I, Polnareff, kill you.

My name is Soul Sacrifice.

My Stand suggests the card called The Devil.

It evokes a curse's dark manipulations,
deteriorating mental health,

and an inauspicious path of ruin and downfall.

How did you know I was in the fridge?

Seriously,

are you that stupid?

You took everything out of the fridge and

didn't bother putting any of it away!

Ebony Devil!

Silver Chariot!

Talk about pathetic.

The ape we met the other
day was a much more powerful

and terrifying Stand user than you.

N-Now you've done it, Polnareff!

How dare you do this to me?!

It hurts! It really hurts!

What's with him?

It hurts!

Curse you...

How dare you?! How dare you do that?!

Now I can really hold a grudge against you!

Such... Such painful agony must be avenged!

I let you find me and attack me on purpose!

H-He's gone...

He disappeared?

Wh-What's going on?

Slash

I-I can't believe it! When did he cut me?

I-I don't think I felt an attack...
No, I'm sure I didn't feel it.

Mr. Joestar! A Stand user
was hiding in my room!

Wait, are you Avdol?!

Anyway, listen! He's completely baffling.

I can't tell if he's strong or weak...

H-He was just creepy!

He ran away... damn it, what the hell?

Don't let your guard down!
My leg's suddenly been cut open.

Soul Sacrifice, who suggests The Devil?

You're positive that's what he said?

Yeah. But no matter how much I think,
it still doesn't make sense.

I know for a fact that I
saw a glimpse of his Stand.

But even though I don't remember an attack,

my leg's been gouged.

Anyway!

I'll be there in five minutes.

Room 1212, on the twelfth floor, right?

Contact Kakyoin and Jotaro for me, too! Later!

This is the front desk.

Hello? Room service?

I hurt my leg a bit...

Could you bring up some kind
of medicine and some bandages?

This is Polnareff in room 912.

Understood. We'll bring it up immediately.

Aw, man...

I got hurt in the pants that I
hadn't washed or even worn yet.

Damn it...

Do you know about the one
who attacked Polnareff, Avdol?

Indeed.

Soul Sacrifice.

An assassin who claims to be
a Native American medicine man.

But he's a terrifying Stand user.

Mafioso, militaries, and politicians

from all around the world hire him.

I've seen Soul Sacrifice once before.

He was covered in wounds,

and those wounds were all obtained

by provoking his enemy to attack.

He controls his Stand through the power
of its grudge against that attacker.

That's why, to ordinary people,
it seems like a curse killed the victims.

And Polnareff fell for that?

Sadly, yes.

What kind of Stand does he use?

No one knows.

Everyone who meets him ends up killed.

Right now, it's dangerous
to leave Polnareff alone.

Or any of us.

So he might be able to pick us off, one by one...

He'll be here in five minutes.

Everyone meet up in this room.

Got it. We'll all meet up in room 1212, old man.

What's going on, Jojo?

Let's go. Apparently we're in danger.

That's weird. I can't find my room key.

I could have sworn I set it here...

Damn it! Where is it?

If I don't have my key,
I won't be able to get back in here.

Could I just tell the front desk?

Is there a fine for that?

There it is. Must've fallen
during all the commotion earlier.

Wha...

What?!

Wh-What's...

I-Is this shampoo?! Damn it! My eyes!

Who's there?!

Th-This isn't good!

Being trapped under the bed isn't good!

Mr. Polnareff, this is room service.

I've brought your medicine.

Get away! You'll be killed!

Huh? Wh-What has happened here?!

Get out of here!
I told you, you'll be killed!

Loom

Slam

How dare you?!

How dare you stab one of
my eyes out, Polnareff?!

A doll?! That's the...

Silver Chariot!

Are you stupid?!

Your Stand isn't one that
can fight where you can't see!

Ebony Devil

Soul Sacrifice

Oh, Jojo.

Did you need something?

So you are here.

Listen up. Don't leave this room for a while.

Huh?

I'll come for you again later.

Don't open the door to any stranger, got it?

O-Okay...

Stab

Damn it! How heavy is this bed, anyway?!

It's at least 120 kilograms...

I have to use Silver Chariot to cut this cord...

Y-You bastard!

As soon as I stop attacking, this happens.

Even if I can't see, I'm just
gonna have to keep stabbing away!

You suck!

Looks like even a knight
can't cut open a watermelon

when he can't see!

Talk about dense!

You bastard...

Give a rest already...

You little shrimp!

It's just you two?

What happened to the girl?

Well, we went to check on her...

But she's not a Stand user, so we thought that

we might be putting her in
more danger by bringing her here.

Good point. So that just leaves Polnareff.

But man, is he late...

It's already been way over five minutes.

Let me go!

I've caught you.

I'm going to snap your spear in half.

All right.

Damn it... But a-at least I
finally managed to cut the cord...

I need to return Chariot under the
bed and get the hell out of here.

Wh-What the hell are you doing?!

Huh?

Hey, Polnareff!

I'm gonna bite your balls off now, man!

What an obscene guy.

Chariot!

Whoa, there.

I'm gonna run off to a
place you can't see now.

You numbskull!

Try giving the floor you're
stuck to a good feel.

Th-This is...

It's soaked with beer, juice, and alcohol!

I spilled them on purpose!

If I could take a piss,

I would have done that to
make it even more wet.

And now... what do you
think I'm gonna do with this

short-circuiting hair
dryer and that wet spot,

Polnareff?

I'm not gonna dry you off!

Die!

This should take care of my grudge...

Polnareff!

You're not the only one who's
been scattering stuff around!

H-How did you know where
I was on top of the bed...

so precisely?!

I broke a mirror!

So I can see the top of the
bed really well from this angle.

At last, we meet.

Whoa, there.

Hey, Soul Sacrifice.

I have a question for you.

I'm looking for a man with two right arms.

How about you tell me
who that guy's Stand is?

You idiot! No assassin
reveals their Stand's identity!

The only time they reveal it is
when they or their opponent is dying!

With stupid Stand users like you guys
who keep showing off your Stands,

we already know all your weak points!

If it weren't for that mirror,
I would have killed you by now!

All right. Come at me one more time.

What's wrong?

Didn't you say you were going to
bite off my balls or something?

Just try it, you vulgar little shit!

Bang

I'm gonna...

slice up everything except your balls!

Ka-ba-ba-bang

Gyaaah

Excuse me, sir.

It seems that you've been
in the bathroom a long time.

Are you all right?

Soul Sacrifice

Bam

Soul Sacrifice's... Last Moments

Polnareff, you're finally here.

You're not very punctual.

All right, everyone.
We're gonna get right to it.

Let's figure out what we're going
to do if Soul Sacrifice attacks us.

I-I'm so tired...

Silver Chariot

Jean Pierre Polnareff

Answer me!

Why was there a dead
boy's body in your room?

And the dead body
that was in the bathroom...

They're connected, aren't they?!

Answer me!

I have the right to remain silent.

You're finally here!
I've been waiting for you.

I had the Speedwagon Foundation
take some measures.

Polnareff should be released soon enough.

But that was close.

To think that the enemy's
pursuit would come so early...

As long as DIO's body is Jonathan Joestar's,

he'll know about everything that Jotaro and I do.

That's why he keeps coming after
us without a moment's rest.

But on the other hand, we're able
to read DIO's thoughts, too.

I'll go buy a Polaroid camera.

You don't have to do that.

I can create a spirit photo
even without a camera.

What?

Michael's not here yet? Where's Michael?

This week's number three jumps
up five points from last week...

The price of gold today is...

You look delicious, meow.

What?!

The channels seem to be changing chaotically.

It's trying to connect words
from the TV into a sentence.

It's more spirit audio than spirit photo.

There...

...is...

...a...

There! It said, "There is a"!

...trai...

...tor...

Kakyoin?! Wh-What?!

I-Impossible. Kakyoin is DIO's servant?

This is...

Joseph Joestar,

you're watching, aren't you?!

DIO!

He found us! Look out!

B-But what does that mean?

It's just as you heard.

It said quite clearly that
Kakyoin is DIO's servant

and that he will betray us.

It can't be!

I trust Kakyoin.

There must be a reason.

But if he is indeed communicating with DIO,

he could take our heads while
we're sleeping at any time.

He'd be DIO's Trojan Horse!

Where is Kakyoin?

He's with Jotaro.

Hey, Jotaro. Are you
going to eat that cherry?

Hey, what are you doing,
Kakyoin? They'll die!

Could he really be a traitor?

A back-breaker? Such a drastic move!

This is unforgivable, isn't it?

Where's Kakyoin?

He's with Jotaro.

Can I get some ice cream?

Welcome.

Little girl,

ice cream is good, but this is tasty, too.

It's chilled coconut juice.

How about it?

I guess we can try it.

Give us three.

Thanks. That'll be twelve dollars.

Hey, make that six dollars.

This should cover it.

Okay.

Thanks!

I'll take that!

Menacing

You thought you could get away
with stealing my wallet, you little shit?

Huh?

Cough up your guts!

Smash

Kakyoin!

Why, you...

You're worth about as much
as a sewer cockroach's dick.

The idea that...

Choke

you thought you could steal my wallet with

Crack

Snap

the same fingers that wipe your filthy ass...

Pop

I can't let you get away with that, can I?

Come on! Come on! Come on!

Hey! What are you doing, Kakyoin?

He's going to die.

A-Amazing. A back-breaker?

Such a vicious move!

And he's using such filthy language...

Come on! Come on! Come on!

Kakyoin!

Didn't you hear me tell you to stop?!

Kakyoin, you bastard.

Something's wrong with you.

Did you get worked up?

That hurt...

You didn't have to push me like that.

That guy tried to steal my wallet,
which makes him a very bad person.

Of course I should punish him.

Am I wrong, Jotaro?

He's...

Episode 9: Yellow Temperance

What are you glaring at?

The look in your eyes is awfully hard, Jotaro.

You couldn't be

planning to part ways with me just because

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

I hurt that thief a little, could you?

Hey, a rhinoceros beetle.

Awesome!

A rhinoceros beetle? Where?

There're four of them up there.

I see them!

Awesome!

Jojo,

don't think so hard about this.

I'm just a bit annoyed today.

The trip's exhausted me
and left me in a bad mood.

You're in a bad mood?

Seemed to me you felt pretty good.

The old man and Avdol think it's a
good idea to head to India by train.

We're leaving tomorrow.

We're taking a cable car to
Singapore Station to reserve tickets.

Mr. Kakyoin...

Jojo's getting further ahead.

R-Right. I'll catch right up.

I guess you like coconut juice
a lot, huh, Mr. Kakyoin?

Huh?

Th-That was a rhinoceros beet—

N-No. I must have seen it wrong.

It must have been a fiber from
the coconut or something.

Yes. I love coconuts.

Is something wrong?

I-It's nothing.

Hey, Jotaro.

Are you going to eat that cherry?

If you're not gonna eat it, give it to me.

I'm starving.

Uh-oh! Look out, Jotaro!

Jojo!

Kidding!

I'm just kidding,

dear Jotaro.

Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick...

Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick...

I-It's like Kakyoin-san's
a totally different person!

There you go again!

What're you glaring at with
that stupid look on your face,

Jotaro, my buddy?

Get on, Kakyoin.

The cable car is here.

I told you to get on.

Here, I've got a ticket for you.

Take it and get yourself lost,

now that you've been possessed!

Wham!

What?!

That's not quite right.

"Possessed" isn't quite right.

Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick...

That's not Kakyoin!

Haven't you realized that my
body's been getting bigger?

Who are you?

A Stand?

But I was able to touch him just now...

Is there a Stand that I can actually hit?

Jojo!

I combine with any flesh that I consume.

So I'm a Stand that normal
people can see and even touch.

I'm Yellow Temperance, of the Temperance card.

This is my true, handsome face!

Come on, Jotaro, my buddy!

Take a look at your hand.

There's a little bit of me
there from when you hit me.

Let me warn you.

If you touch that, it'll go
after your left hand, too.

Go ahead and pick your
nose with that left hand!

This is a Stand that devours things slowly...

The more it eats, the bigger it gets.

You'll never get it off!

D-Damn you...

Come on!

Whaddya mean, "come on"?!

While I'm digesting you, I'll be sure
to stuff your mouth with your own shit!

I-It burns.

Y-You bastard...

Oh, J-Jojo's grandpa? There's trouble!

Anne? What's wrong?

M-Mr. Kakyoin is...

Kakyoin?!

Did he actually betray us?

Mr. Kakyoin's face split apart!

But Mr. Kakyoin wasn't actually Mr. Kakyoin!

And...

Jojo's in the cable car and there's

this weird slime eating his finger
and we're in a lot of trouble!

Calm down! Where are you right now?

The cable car station near the trade center!

He's being attacked!

Mr. Kakyoin is attacking Jojo!

Hurry and come back to the hotel—

Did someone say my name?

Where have you been?

Jojo left me behind,
so I was sunbathing by the pool.

With your school uniform on?

Yes. So?

It's all right. He's the real one!

Which means, Anne, your Kakyoin is...

a fake!

I know that!

Jojo!

Jojo just jumped out of the cable car!

Star Platinum

Jotaro Kujo

G-Good grief.

A Stand that combines with flesh?

It's devouring my finger...

Anyway, before I fight him,

I need to do something about this Stand.

If worse comes to worst,
I might have to chop off my finger.

Do you really think you got away?

Well, I guess I'd better tell you.

Get a straw, suck out all the
gunk in your ears, and listen up.

My Stand, Yellow Temperance,
has no weaknesses.

It's not that you ran away.

It's just that I don't have to chase you,

you little shit!

It'll burn me, too,
but I guess I'll burn it to death.

This...

It just made it spread!

Heating it is a bad idea...

Damn it.

Pardon.

Oh, my. Talk about a strange entrance.

Don't mind me.

Hey, kid. Lemme see your ice pop for a sec.

Hey! What are you
doing to that boy's ice pop?

Is this your kid?

No.

Then shut up and enjoy the scenery.

Sorry. When we get to the ground,
I'll buy you a new one.

'Kay.

If I can't heat it...

That bastard!

N-Now it's forming needles and
digging deeper into my hand!

Hey, you! Fire and ice won't work at all.

I told you. It doesn't have a weakness.

You little shit!

You're...

Papa! The puppy! The puppy!

You bastard! You were already in this cable car?

M-My Pocky!

It's dangerous! Don't pull!

Let go!

I'm here to finish you off...

Jotaro, my buddy!

You're fast! But...

Like I keep telling you,
I don't have any weaknesses!

Are you even listening to me?

You dumbass redneck!

My Stand is essentially an
armor that consumes power.

A barrier that attacks!

No matter how fast you may be,
no matter how strong you may be,

it's absolutely useless
before Yellow Temperance!

You can't defeat me!

You can't even run,
unless you cut off your right hand!

Do you understand?!

You have no way of winning!

You can't get away!

Not until you're digested! I'll eat you up!

Good grief.

This thing really doesn't have a weakness.

It could be the most powerful thing ever.

How terrifying.

But the Kujo family... No.

The Joestar family has its own philosophy

when it comes to fighting.

I still have

just one strategy left.

What?

That's...

That's...

...to run away!

What the hell?!

You're in the middle of being eaten, you ass!

My Stand's got a hold of you that you
can't escape, and you say you'll run?

I may be running...

But I'm running into the water.

I-I can't breathe...

You opened your Stand's guard
so you could breathe.

No matter how invincible that Stand may be,

if I defeat the user, the Stand will die, too.

Do you understand?

You sure said all the crap
you wanted to back there.

I'm the type that takes such things to heart.

Crush

S-Stop...

I can't recover anymore!

My nose is broken.

They're going to have to wire my jaw, too.

DIO bought my services.

I don't plan to risk my
life going after you people.

There! See?

How about you talk?

Tell me about the Stand users
that are planning to attack us.

Th-That's the one thing I can't say.

I have some pride.

I can't rat out my own side...

I see. Well, that's honorable.

I remember now!

Death, The Empress, The Hanged Man,

and The Emperor are the
four that will come after you!

I see. And what are their powers?

I-I don't know.

N-No, really! I really don't know!

Stand users don't show others their powers,

because it'd expose their weaknesses.

B-But there is some witch
who told DIO about Stands...

And her son is among the four.

His name is Centerfold.

He's a man with two right hands.

His card is The Hanged Man.

He's the one that killed
Polnareff's sister, isn't he?

I've heard a rumor about his powers...

A mirror. Apparently, he uses a mirror.

I haven't actually seen it,

but Polnareff has no chance of winning.

He's gonna die.

I just realized, Jotaro...

But it looks like the goddess
of fortune is still on my side.

See that drain?

There are a lot of crayfish around it.

Take a good look.

A manhole...

That little drain

is connected to the manhole that's near me!

I'm gonna pull you in and hold you there!

Now you can't attack me!

Looks like what I told you

about the man with two
right hands will go to waste.

Jotaro Kujo!

To think there was a hole so close
that I could pull you into...

Man, am I ever lucky!

I even ate some crayfish and powered up.

I'll crush you up

and turn you into jam!

If I kill you, DIO will give
me a hundred million dollars.

To think I can make that much
from a few minutes of fighting.

Don't you think I'm pretty lucky?

You ball-less little dick!

Good grief.

It's rather hard to observe yourself.

Haven't you realized you
were only lucky up until now?

Before, you only suffered a broken nose.

That was when you were truly lucky!

Crush

A water pressure punch...
f-from inside the drain?!

I-I was just kidding, Mr. Jotaro!

I was just messing with ya!
I didn't mean anything by it.

Come on, now.
Did you take it personally?

Y-You're not thinking of
hitting me any more, are you?

I'm a seriously injured man...

My nose is broken and my
jaw's gonna have to be wired shut...

I have nothing more to say to you.

You're too pathetic

to talk to any more.

Yellow Temperance

Rubber Soul

Good grief.

So we're finally heading to India.

So the man with two right
hands is called Centerfold...

By the way, where's Anne?

She was at Singapore Station

up until the time the train departed, but...

I'm sure that the time for her
to meet her father had arrived,

so she went to see him.

I can't help but think that
the brat was lying about

seeing her father, though...

Well, it's a bit lonely without
her around, isn't it, Jojo?

But talk about creepy...

A Stand that perfectly disguised itself as me.

Apparently, it had already
transformed when we left the hotel.

Jojo, are you going to eat that cherry?

I don't mean to be greedy,
but they're my favorite.

Could I have it?

Yeah.

Thanks.

Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick...

Hey, look, Jojo. Flamingos in flight.

Good grief.

Jojo...

And now

Calcutta

we're about to cross India...

But, well, I'm a little worried.

My image of India is a place where people

only eat curry and you
could fall ill at any time.

I'm worried that my body may not
be able to handle the culture gap.

That assessment is rather distorted.

You needn't worry. It's a nice
country, where simple people live.

I can guarantee it.

Well, we're in Calcutta. Let's go.

Here, have this.

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

This is chai.

It's delicious.

Chai.

A popular drink in India.

A sweet drink made by boiling
black tea, sugar, and ginger with milk.

At last, a little peace.

It's just a matter of getting used to it.

Once you get used to it,
you'll see how wonderful this country is.

I like this place. It's pretty great.

Seriously, Jotaro? You really mean that?

Talk about culture shock.

I'll like it once I get used to it, huh?

Well, they say that people
adapt to their surroundings.

Where's the john?

It's over there.

Polnareff.

Yeah?

What about your order?

I'll leave it to you.

It had better be something amazing.

Gorgeous, splendid food
that suits a Frenchman like me.

Which means we can pick anything.

Let's see, something he'll like...

Excuse me.

Oh, please wait, sir.

Please use this.

What's this stick for?

Hey.

The toilet's shaped oddly, but it's pretty clean.

A nice guy like myself can't
stand it when bathrooms are dirty.

Is something wrong?

D-D-D-D-Don't "Is something wrong?" at me!

Th-Th-Th-Th-The toilet...

The toilet...

Oink

There's a pig sticking
its head out of the toilet!

This toilet is unusual, even in India.

They accidentally made the
pig pen down below a little too high.

So when the pig gets hungry,
it sticks its head out.

Th-That's not what I'm aski—

Er, wait, what?!
That means this pig's food is...

That's why it's there?!

That's why you use this.

Here...

See? Now you can go while the pig's
recoiling from the blow to the head.

Our manager actually gets the
pig to lick his butt and always says

how great it is, because he gets so clean.

Please, take your time.

W-Wait! Don't leave me alone!

Gulp.

Menacing

I don't think I could ever get used to this...

I'll wait until we get to the hotel.

Sorry to keep you waiting.

Crap.

H-He's gone?

I could have sworn I
saw something weird there.

I must have imagined it.

I guess I can't help it.

I mean, there was a pig in the toilet.

It's not surprising I'd see an illusion
of a monster outside the window.

So this is what they mean
by culture shock in India.

Wha...

What?!

Huh? Huh?

Wh-What is this?!

I can only see it in the mirror!

So this is the mirror Stand
that Jotaro heard about.

Th-This isn't good.

This really isn't good!

Silver Chariot!

Wh-What the hell is that?!

Damn it!

Stand!

Where's the user? Who is it?!

The man with two right hands...

There are so many people...

Damn it!

What's wrong, Polnareff?

What's happening?

If that...

If that was the Stand, that means...

That means he's finally here!

Jotaro, the Stand user you heard
about that uses mirrors is here!

The bastard that killed my little sister!

The bastard that stepped all
over my sister's life, soul, and pride.

I can finally... I can finally see him!

The one you seek vengeance upon is here?

Mr. Joestar, I'll be traveling on my own here.

Wh—

Now that I know the guy
who killed my sister is nearby,

I'm not going to wait
for him to come after me.

I'd be at a disadvantage
if I let him attack me,

and it's not my style.

I'll find him first, and kill him!

Even though you don't know what
he looks like, or what his Stand is?

Knowing that he has two right hands is plenty!

And he knows that I'm after him, as well.

He should be worried that I'll
come for his head in his sleep.

See ya.

You'll go out for wool,
only to come home shorn.

What's that supposed to mean?

Just as it sounds.

Are you implying that I'm going to lose?

Indeed.

Can't you see that the enemy
purposely attacked to get you alone?

I will not allow you to travel alone, Polnareff.

Listen up. I'm going to make this clear.

I never cared about DIO.

I told you in Hong Kong that
I was only traveling with you

so I could get my revenge.

Mr. Joestar and Jotaro
should already know this.

I've been alone from the start!

I've always been fighting alone!

Such a selfish man!

Did you forget that you
were brainwashed by DIO?

Have you forgotten that
this all leads back to DIO?

Like you'd ever understand how
I feel after having my sister killed!

I heard that the last time you met DIO,
you got scared and ran away.

A coward like you would
never understand how I feel!

What did you say?

Don't touch me.

You were just lucky that
you beat me in Hong Kong.

Don't lecture me.

Why, you...

Oh, did that piss you off?

But don't forget that I'm a lot more
pissed off than you are right now!

You can just keep acting like
the mature one as always, Avdol.

Why, you—

Mr. Joestar!

That's enough. Let him go.

Now that he's like this, no one can stop him.

No, I'm just disappointed in him.

I didn't think he was that sort of man.

I did indeed run in fear.

That's also why I believe we will win,

and can say with certainty that you'll lose.

What?

Then I'll say this with certainty, too.

Your divination will be wrong.

Tromp Tromp Tromp

Get off.

I'm here to see a friend.

Go back yourself from here.

Please, make me your wife.

I will dedicate my life to you.
Just tell me whatever you wish of me.

So please, let me stay by your side forever.

Don't be stupid. You're still only sixteen.

I'm old enough to marry.

I love you.

Listen. I'm just a drifter.

I live each day like it's my last,
and one day, it will be my last.

Royalty like yourself can't
think about marrying me.

No matter how much we love each other.

Really?

You love me?

Yeah. You're the only one
I love in the whole world.

That's exactly why.

It's because I love you that I can't marry you.

You understand, don't you?

It's hard for me, too.
My chest feels like it could burst.

But I'll come see you once in
a while and hold you like this.

That's enough to make me happy.

Yes...

Later. Love ya.

It's not nice to eavesdrop.

I'm sure you'd like to say
I'm being as indirect as ever,

and that there're girls like her everywhere...

But she's an easy mark, and it's convenient.

She'd do anything for me,
even throw away her own life.

You know how I work, don't you?

Menacing

Mr. Centerfold.

By the way, about Silver Chariot's Polnareff.

Seems he's looking for you on his own.

What will you do?

He fell hook, line, and sinker
for your plan to lure him out.

Shall we kill him first?

Blam

Let's go.

With you and your Hanged Man,
and me, Hol Horse, with my Emperor,

We can kill 'em all.

Hanged Man

Centerfold

So he didn't come back after all.

What?

You saw him?

You're sure you saw a
man with two right hands?

Where?

Huh? That's weird.

I lost him. He was just right there, too.

What?

He was with that man right there.

Fwoosh

The gun is mightier than the sword.

Man, talk about a memorable quote.

Who the hell are you?

Hol Horse is the name.

I'm the user of the Stand
that suggests the Emperor card.

Lord DIO paid me to get rid of you guys.

Hey, country boy.
I don't need the self-introduction.

Do you know the man with two right hands?

Well, that was rude.
You asked, so I answered.

Well, whatever.

I came here with him.

He's nearby.

What?

Where is he?!

No point in asking that.

I, Hol Horse, will be taking care of you.

Trash like you always says that,

and it always ends up the other way around.

Oh? Was that funny?

Lord DIO said that Polnareff was
a man who underestimated others,

and that I'd have no problem beating him.

He was exactly right,
so I couldn't help but laugh.

If I can't see him until I defeat you,
then that's just what I'll do.

Bring it on.

You know Stratego, right?

The tank is stronger than the soldier,
and tanks are weak against mines.

See, it's pretty much the basics of battle.

My Emperor is stronger than you,

so I thought I'd let you know about
my Stand's abilities before we fight.

The gun is mightier than the sword.

Seriously, such a memorable quote.

What are you trying to say?

My Stand shoots.

A sword can't beat a weapon that shoots.

So, what? A pea shooter?

I'll kill you!

You underestimated me, Polnareff!

Blam

And now, you've lost!

Fwoom

If it takes off its armor...

It's nothing but a bullet!

What?!

I-Impossible! The trajectory curved!

C-Crap!

The bullet is also my Stand.

Underestimating me by
not even considering that

will cost you your life!

Polnareff!

Wha— Avdol!

I went looking for you because
I was worried, and look what I find!

You're too full of yourself, Polnareff.

W-Worried?

Damn you! Are you going to lecture me again?

The enemy knows everything about you!

You said you've lived life alone,

but from now on,
you won't be able to win alone!

What bad timing for an outsider to interfere.

Curve

Move, Polnareff! The bullet's coming back!

Magician's Red!

I'll burn it to cinders!

Damn that Avdol!
He went after Polnareff himself.

Where are you, Mr. Avdol? Polnareff?

I have a terrible feeling...

Hey, there's a weird fight going on over there.

The puddle...

What?!

Mr. Avdol!

Man, today must be my day.

My gun and Centerfold's mirror
don't do very well with Avdol's flames,

so we thought he'd be
our most formidable enemy.

Talk about luck!

There are no scary pieces
left in this game of Stratego.

Mr. Avdol!

H-He's just hurt...

It's just a minor wound.

See? He's going to start speaking...

He'll open his eyes at any moment.

Right, Mr. Avdol?

You're going to wake up, right?

Mr. Avdol, wake up!

Please! Mr. Avdol!

Impossible. This was too easy.

It was too quick!

That's what he gets for lecturing people.

Look at him now.

Wha...

What did you say, Polnareff?

Mr. Avdol was worried about you—

Who asked him for help?!

He likes to meddle in other people's business,

but he's slow as hell, so they got him.

Guys like him just get in the way...

That's why I said I'd do this myself.

You bastard...

He saved your life. How dare you...

It really annoys me!

Having people up and die on me...

Polnareff...

It just annoys me so much!

He's got a bold face,
and yet he died so easily.

Come to think of it, she
was really good at sobbing...

Your sister, that is.

Are you telling me to hold back?

Don't fall for the enemy's provocation!

Mr. Avdol told you not to fight by yourself!

Well, the end of someone's life is
usually a pretty sudden curtain call.

It's probably normal to die without
being able to say goodbye.

It may seem like I'm talking as
though I know everything, but...

Polnareff! Please, don't let him get to you!

Do you still not understand?

Mr. Avdol told you not to fight by yourself!

And you ignored that...

You wanted to get revenge,
even if it meant dying with your enemy.

Mr. Avdol followed you because that
worried him, and this is what happened!

So what am I supposed to do?

We need to fall back for now.

Avdol was cruelly stabbed in the back.

My sister was killed without resistance.

You want me to hold these
regrets inside and run away?!

Don't fight them when we don't
even know how their Stands work yet!

Don't fight a battle that will kill you!

That's what Mr. Avdol was trying to tell you.

Hey! Come on, li'l Pol Pol.

Why, you...

Polnareff! Slowly come back towards me.

We're going to use that
truck to get out of here.

Y-You're telling me to hold it in?

A-All ri—

Hey, Polnareff.

Bam

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
Stardust Crusaders

Episode 11:
The Emperor and The Hanged Man, Part 2

Avdol died for you.

I think that means you owe him.

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

He might not have died, if not for you.

Y-You bastard.

Where's your real body?!

Polnareff, calm down!

But there's no need to be sad.
Actually, you should be happy...

Since you'll be together again soon.

You'll die, and then you can be with
those two fools in the next world.

Your little sister was really cute, Polnareff...

Once you're reunited with your
sister, you should ask her

about exactly how I killed her!

Polnareff, don't let him provoke you!

He wants you to attack!

Bastard!

Your Chariot cannot cut my Hanged Man.

I am within a mirror.

Your Stand can't enter a mirror. That's why!

You mad?

I bet you're mad.

Hey, Hol Horse. Fire away.
Let's put an end to this idiot.

Aye aye, sir.

Die!

Emerald Splash!

What?!

What? He shot...

...Polnareff!

Kakyoin, was it? Not bad.

That's out of my Stand's range.

Even if I hit him from here,

the bullet wouldn't hit with much force.

Mr. Centerfold went after them, eh?

He must really want to finish off Polnareff.

S-Sorry, Kakyoin.

I-I...

I thought I didn't care if I died,
so long as I could avenge my sister.

But I understand now...

I understand how Avdol felt.

I won't let his feelings go to waste.

I'll fight to keep living.

Do you really understand?

Yeah.

Crack

Take this instead of a handshake as
proof that we've made up, Polnareff.

Right. Th-Thank you, Kakyoin.

When they come after us again,
we'll defeat them together.

Avdol, you...

At that moment, I'm sure that
I stabbed him with the sword.

But my strike didn't land.

There was no resistance.

Even after breaking the mirror,

his Stand, Hanged Man,
still attacked from the shards.

He'll attack my reflection
from within the mirror.

My Stand can't go inside a mirror...

How am I supposed to attack him
if he's in some kind of mirror world?

Damn it!

Polnareff, you keep talking about

"inside the mirror" and "the mirror world,"

but there is no world inside a mirror.

This isn't some fantasy or fairy tale.

What are you talking about?
You saw it, too, didn't you?!

You can only see him in a mirror,
and when you turn around, he's not there.

Yes.

But what you see in a mirror
is just a reflection created by light.

You don't have to tell me that!

Listen! I'm talking about
what's going on right now.

If there are such things as Stands,
there could be a mirror world, too!

There isn't.

Look, you...

I think that fact is what will let us
solve the mystery of Hanged Man.

If Stands can defeat other Stands,

then there's still something
we don't know about his—

Polnareff! He's inside the
plating on the steering wheel!

What?!

He's caught up to us!

Look out!

A-Are you okay, Kakyoin?

I-I hit my chest, but I'm fine.

What?

Chariot!

Slice

Kakyoin! Get away from
anything that's reflective!

Damn it... I got it. I just saw it.

He's going from mirror to mirror!

He moves by jumping from one
reflective surface to another!

He traveled all this way

by reflecting over and over!

Reflecting?

That means he's actually light!

The true nature of his Stand is light?

Kakyoin! He was just in the car's bumper!

He's going to reflect off of the
car's bumper and into something else.

Don't go near anything that's reflective.

And take anything off
your body that reflects!

Take off the buttons on your uniform!

Mister, are you guys okay?

Want me to bring some medicine or something?

Hey! Kid! It's dangerous, so get out of here!

Hey, your car's totally messed up...

Hey, you're bleeding.

What?!

Are you okay?

Th-That asshole!

He's in the kid's eye!

Hey, kid. Don't look at us.

Huh?

I told you not to look at us!

Stop following me with your eyes! Damn it!

Huh? But you're hurt.

I'm fine! See? Perfectly fine!

So go look over there!

But you're bleeding...

Look over there, you brat!

Damn you, Centerfold!

What are you going to do?

You wouldn't stab this cute little kid's eye out

with that sword of yours,
would you, Polnareff?

Polnareff!

I finally got you.

You can't run anymore.

Not unless you stab the kid's eye out.

What a coward! This is unforgivable!

Hey, Kakyoin.

You don't say things like
that in this kind of situation.

Listen! In situations like this,

you've got to say something more
like this before you get your revenge.

My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff.

For my sister's honor, and so that
my friend Avdol can rest in peace...

I'm going to hurl you

into the depths of despair, Centerfold!

Forgive me, kid! I'll buy you a caramel later!

There's sand in my eye!

Slice

Bam

P-Polnareff, he's in your eye...

I don't really understand the principle,

but he essentially moves at the speed of light.

A speed that you wouldn't
normally be able to see.

But I knew that if the kid closed his eyes,

the next place he'd move
to would be my own eye.

I see...

Hanged Man can only exist
within the world of reflections.

When one world is about to be destroyed,

he has to move to something
else that's reflective.

So...

As long as I can read his trajectory,
he'll be easy to cut with a sword.

His real body is over there!

You bastard. Finally...

Finally!

We finally meet...

Centerfold!

My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff,

and I've seen through your Stand's secret.

It's a Stand of light that
moves at incredible speed.

There's no way I can catch it.

But if I know where it's going to go,

and I slash its trajectory in that moment,

I can slash you, too!

If Kakyoin and Avdol hadn't shown up,

I probably wouldn't have figured that
out and you would have killed me.

Polnareff! He's not the
man with two right hands!

That's not Centerfold!

Wh-What?!

Polnareff!

Emperor

Hol Horse

Polnareff!

Over here.

Bam

You fool!

I'm Centerfold.

You...

He's just a drifter that
happened to be in town.

I just used a knife to give him
the same wound I have.

You totally fell for it!

Coming close to him

without knowing what I
looked like was a big mistake!

You bastard!

Take this! My Emerald—

Hey, hold on a sec.

Take a good look around you.

Hey, gather 'round!

These guys say they'll give you money!

What?!

They'll give us money for nothing!

Thank you!

You have such big hearts!

Thank you! Thank you!

Thank you!

Please give us money!

Have you figured out what's going on?

You say you've seen through my Stand?

You fool.

I've known about my Stand's
weakness for quite some time.

If there are lots of reflective surfaces
so you can't find its trajectory,

it has no weakness!

Don't look! Don't stare!

Don't stare at us!

You can't run anymore.

What are you going to do? Blow everyone up?

You sacrificed your youth to hunt me down...

And you're going to fail before you finish?!
Talk about a lonely, boring life.

Meanwhile I, Centerfold,
will continue to have cute girls

like your sister all around me,
and live a fun, happy life!

Come to think of it, your sister

was really good at sobbing...

You can die now.

Wh-Why, you...

Polnareff, that's not what you say here.

When taking revenge,
you shouldn't say, "Why, you..."

You say this.

My name is Noriaki Kakyoin.

To avenge my friend, Avdol,

and so that the soul of my friend
Polnareff's sister may rest in peace,

I will have you pay with your life.

I'll give this gold coin to whoever picks it up.

It's so shiny, you can see your face in it!

Now I see, Kakyoin.

Looks like all of their eyes
are focused on one point now.

Yeah.

We know the trajectory that
Hanged Man will have to take!

Merci, Kakyoin!

The moment!

Rip

Hold it!

It won't open!

Looks like you're the one who's
really good at sobbing, Centerfold!

Well, you're about to fall to Hell,
sobbing the whole way down.

But there's one thing I can't rely on
the guardians of Hell to do for me.

And that's...

To turn you into a pincushion!

I've been waiting years for this moment!

I'll leave the rest to King Yama.

So this is the true Hanged Man...

He was rotten to the core.

I got my revenge.

Hanged Man

Centerfold

Hold it!

I finally caught up with you guys.

Why are you walking so slow?

If you're gonna run,
run like your lives depend on it.

Right, Mr. Centerfold?

Better say your prayers. Your lives end here!

So act like this is the end and come at us!

Show us what you've got, damn it!

Right, Mr. Centerfold?

Hey, are you listening, Mr. Centerfold?!

I don't think he's listening anymore.

He's rather busy right now...

Since he's being sentenced in Hell!

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

Don't try to pull that nonsense!
Bluffing won't work on me!

There's no way you can beat him!

Even I don't stand a chance
against the invincible Hanged Man!

Polnareff, your jokes suck.

That piece of shit's body is about
two or three thousand meters that way.

Want to take a look?

Okay, I will!

Hey! You're running away?!

I-I don't stand a chance!

I'm at a total disadvantage by myself!

I'll run for now and wait
for the next opportunity!

I'm the type whose power only shows
when I'm paired with someone else.

Being #2 is better than #1!

That's Hol Horse's philosophy of life!

Got a problem with it?!

What?!

Mr. Joestar! Jotaro!

We already know about Avdol.

Though it was a simple funeral,
his body's been buried.

The one who stabbed Mr. Avdol in the
back was the man with two right hands,

but the cause of death was Hol Horse's bullet.

What shall we do with him?

I'll give him his sentence.

Death!

Wha?!

Please run, Sir Hol Horse!

Sir Hol Horse!

What's with this woman?!

I don't know what's going on,

but I'm always thinking of you!

That is my reason to live!

Please run! Hurry!

You bitch! Let go of me!

What are you thinking?!

Jotaro! Kakyoin! Don't let Hol Horse get away!

Too late.

Huh? Oh...

Well said, baby!

I'll gladly accept your
feelings and keep on living!

I'm running away because I love you, baby!

Forever!

Why, you...

Come back here!

Ah...

Don't "ah" me, you bitch!

Polnareff, that woman was
just another one he was using.

And he no longer had any intention of fighting.

We have no time to deal with him.

Avdol is gone.

But we have to hurry ahead.

It's already been fifteen
days since we left Japan.

Damn it...

Well, I guess it can't be helped.

All right! Let's resume our trip to Egypt.

Listen up! In order to defeat DIO,
our hearts have to be as one.

We can't go off on our own!

That's when he'll come after us.

Got it?

Let's get a move on!

Good grief.

My son has just died...

I can sense the misfortune that
has befallen my son, Centerfold,

through the connection we share as a family.

My precious son...

So you died covered with wounds like this...

I sense it through this pain,
the same pain you felt.

You were magnificent as you
fought for Lord DIO, Centerfold!

But...

To kill someone like you, with a soul so pure...

I'm sure they did something underhanded.

Damn them!

The bastards!

I will make sure they pay a terrifying price

with the Empress card!

Crush

Move!

Now is the time to take action...

With the Stand that kills slowly!

I'm so sad!

I shall kill them all!

Episode 12: The Empress

Listen up.

I don't usually lecture.

Stupid people are stupid because
they don't understand something

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

even when you keep repeating it.

You know guys like that, right?

Idiots that just don't understand.

But you know, uh...

I never got your name...

Nena.

Nena! That's a great name.

You're the daughter of

a wealthy family in the sacred city Varanasi
that we're passing through, right?

You're good-looking, and I can
see that you're a smart girl.

I have an eye for people,
so I'm going to lecture you.

Hol Horse is a horrible, lying bastard.

You're being tricked!
Your parents would cry.

Listen up.

You can't end up like this.

It's easy to do that when you're in love...

But you can't look at things this way.

It's important to look broadly, and be rational.

Hey. It's coming into view.

The city of Varanasi.

The holy river, the Ganges.

Saints, the old, the sickly, children,

cows, dogs, monkeys, food,
excrement, burning corpses...

This river gently embraces
all these things as it flows.

Everything from birth to
death is laid bare in this river.

It is said that people can spend months

here in the sacred city of Varanasi
without getting bored.

That is probably because
the scenery one sees in this city

reflects the scenery of one's soul.

Chomp

Man... it's getting worse.

What's wrong, old man?
You don't look well.

Looks like the spot that I thought
was a bug bite got infected.

It's definitely swollen.

It would be best to have a doctor
look at it before it gets worse.

Hey, doesn't that sort of
look like a person's face?

Stop kidding around, Polnareff.

Sorry 'bout that.

Want me to go to the hospital with you?

No! Stop treating me like an old man.

Let's cut this off.

Huh? What'd you say?!

It's definitely infected.

If we don't cut it off and get
the poison out, it'll get worse.

Hey, hey, hey.

Can't we just put some
medicine and a bandage on it?

Don't worry. We'll numb
the area, so it won't hurt.

No problem. No problem at all.

Come now, lie down.

I studied medicine in England.

I can do appendectomies, too.

Uh-oh. It's a little rusty.

Well, that's no problem.

All right.

Let's chop that off.

What the hell?

I don't want to watch it being cut off.

No problem.

Hey, are you done?

Is it over yet?

Shriek

Shriek

What?!

Hey, Doctor!

Trying to cut me?
You're pretty stupid, you moron!

Wh-What the hell is this?!

I'm the Empress, as in the
Empress card, Old Man Joseph!

And now, I'm gonna bloody you up good!

When did you get on me, damn it?!

Clang

It has teeth! It stopped the scalpel!

It's so strong!

It grabbed the scalpel!

Slice

Oh, no!

Th-Thank goodness it was my artificial hand.

You bastard! You're gonna cut yourself?

I'm part of your body, Old Man Joseph.

You can't get away from me now, honey.

Now, why don't I guess what you're thinking?

This is what you're thinking...

Stands can only be beaten by other Stands.

Your Stand, Hermit Purple,
uses the power of remote viewing,

the ability to see things far away.

Is that enough to fight?

Can that defeat the thing
that's fused with your arm?

Nope! Not possible!

Where's the user?

Where was I when you stuck to me?

You fool! Like I'd tell you!

Damn you!

Are you going to your friends?

I wonder if it'll go that smoothly.

Doctor, your next patient is waiting...

Th-The doctor...!

H-Hey! Don't get the wrong idea!

I didn't—

I am the culprit!

I am Joseph Joestar! An American!

I'm staying at Hotel Clarks!

What?!

By the way, girlie.

I have a thing for hot
young nurses like yourself.

What?!

Murderer!

Wait! It's not true!

Oh, no...

Now you can't go back to the hotel.

Now I can kill you without
anyone getting in the way!

Y-You little bitch!

I'll crush you to bits!

What?

Hey, this is your arm.

Take care of it, you shitty old man.

It grew arms. I-Is it continuing to grow?

H-Hey! Let go!

What are you holding on to? Let go!

Nope!

Officer! The culprit's over here!

He's right here!

It's been a while since it came to this...

Hey! What are you doing?

Overdrive!

You moron!

This is your arm!

You think your Hamon would
work against your own body?

You, right there! Don't move!

In that case, Hermit Purple!

I-It's squeezing me...

I can use Hermit Purple this way, too!

I told you not to move!

You! Stop right there!

Damn it!

What are you doing? It's dark in here!

What is happening?

Hermit Purple

Joseph Joestar

So really, Nena...

Real men don't talk big.

That's how you figure out who's a liar.

Since I was avoiding the police,

I ended up going in the
opposite direction of the hotel.

If I'd known this would happen,

I would have taken Polnareff with me.

Instead of a petty guy like Hol Horse,

how about me? Am I not your type?

I don't dwell on the past.

I don't care who you were dating in the past.

What's important is the future.

If our feelings understand each other.

Oh, look over there.

That place is a hotel run by a
Japanese woman named Kumiko.

She manages it with her Indian husband.

Out of the way.

You'll get run into.

We can probably get a room very cheap.

Oh, really?

Now, what about this hotel?

Crunch

Wha...

What are you doing?

I'm eating, Joestar.

To get bigger.

You stole those at the market!
You quick little bastard.

Plop

Why, you...

Wham

Now I'm this big!

You might say I'm mooching off my parent...

Well, I guess in this case
it'd be my parent's arm, Papa.

You ugly bitch!

I'll show you that I, Joseph Joestar,

have many years more
fighting experience than you!

I said that, but what the hell am I going to do?

Damn it...

Anyway, Hermit Purple!

Father, thank you for raising me.

But you shouldn't tie your children down like this.

You need to raise your children to be free.

Chomp

Oh, no!

I-It's no use.

I want to use Hermit Purple's
remote viewing to find the user,

but I don't have a camera!

Wh-What should I do?

At this rate... is not just my arm,

but my whole body going
to become part of her?

I've now grown enough that I can kill you.

See? My hand can reach your neck.

If I bust the carotid artery
in your neck, you're done for.

Oh, no!

What's that guy doing?

You bastard!

What the hell is that?

Look!

That guy's got a nasty-looking growth on his arm.

Damn it! Where's the Stand user?

Polnareff, sir...

I'm a woman who can't survive
without a reliable man.

I love you... Because you're
very reliable and kind.

H-Hey, where did all that come from?

I-Is this for real?

I'm totally going to fall for her!

Lucky!

Hey, Joseph Joestar.

You idiot.

You keep getting further and
further from Jotaro and the others.

Do you think I'm running around
randomly just to wear myself out?

I'm running so I can kill you!

It was so...

I could dunk you in this!

Blop

Stick

You senile old man!

A nail?!

I picked it up earlier.

I picked it up when we were
rolling around on the ground earlier.

So I can cut open your carotid artery!

Did you think I'd suffocate
if you stuck me in here?

Die!

I have a physical form,
but I'm not a living organism.

Did you already forget that?

Only Stands can defeat Stands.

Hey, didn't you say you were going to show

the difference in our fighting experience earlier?

Where's that "experience" you were talking about?

You're just a helpless geezer who's gotten too old!

M-My artificial fingers...

They were on the verge of breaking
from her attack earlier,

and now I can't get any strength in them...

Just one more push, now.

Your life as an invalid is
about to come to an end.

There's not a single way you can defeat m—

Huh?

Not a single way...

What?

Not a single what?

Sorry, my hearing isn't what it used to be.

Run that by me one more time.

Coal tar!

You stuck me into coal tar!

It wasn't to suffocate me,
but to solidify me!

B-But...

How did you know there was coal tar in there?

With the power of my Stand, Hermit Purple.

H-Hey, everyone look...

What is this?

The ashes that foreigner spilled everywhere...

They've formed into a map of the city.

Y-You used spirit photography!

That's how you found the coal tar.

You used the ashes to make a spirit photo!

Now I think you should be able to see
the difference in our fighting experience.

Once your opponent starts to boast
his victory, he has already lost.

This is how Joseph Joestar does things.

I guess I just get better with age.

And...

A Stand can tear away another Stand.

You're going to say,
"Stop, anything but that."

Stop! Stop, anything but that!

Bam

This isn't good. It pains me, too.

Children can't depend on their parents forever.

You've got to go out on your
own once you've grown big!

Now then... where's this Stand user?

W-Well, then, Nena...

Let's swear our love with a kiss.

What? What? What the hell?!

Wh-What's wrong, Nena?!

Burst

Gyaah

So that's The Empress's Stand user...

Huh?

Huh?!

This ugly woman...

She attached her Stand to me
as a tumor with a human face,

and camouflaged herself as a beautiful woman.

That was pretty careless...

She totally played you, Polnareff.

U-Ugh...

Empress

Nena

And here I thought we'd
finally be able to sleep in a bed.

Maybe if the old man hadn't screwed up
and gotten cops chasing him down.

I took care of things.

We can take this car.

Polnareff, you can do the driving.

Hey, are you still in shock?

I was the one attacked by the Stand.

I'd rather have gone through that...

Soon we'll reach the Indo-Pakistani border...

We'll be saying goodbye to India very soon.

Indeed. At first I wondered what
kind of country we'd walked into,

but now I miss the hustle
and bustle of Calcutta,

and the rushing waters of the Ganges.

I'll be coming back again,

so I can make Avdol a proper grave.

Mr. Avdol...

The road's getting narrower.

Stop driving so slow! You're in the way!

I'm gonna pass them.

Polnareff, you're being reckless!

This four-wheel drive is great!

Hey, do you think that might've
flung pebbles at their car?

Who knows? It could have.

We don't need any trouble
or accidents right now.

I'm wanted because of what
happened in Varanasi, you know.

I'd like to get across the border safely.

What's the matter, Polnareff?

I just told you we don't need accidents!

N-No, look! Look who's standing over there!

Good grief...

Hey! Looks like we meet again.

Give me a lift?

I mean, I'm a girl.

Soon I'll be wearing a bra,

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

I'd look pathetic wandering around
the world when I'm that age.

This is the only chance I have! Right now!

To run away from home and see the world...

Don't you think so?

I mean, I feel bad for lying about
going to see my dad in Singapore,

but let's just forget that.

It's the car we passed earlier.

They appear to be in a hurry.

Let them pass.

Yeah...

Hey, now!

What are they trying to do?

I let you pass, so hurry up and go.

Maybe they're mad because
you were so reckless earlier.

Did you see the driver's face?

No... Maybe it's because of
all the dust on the window,

but I couldn't see them.

So you couldn't, either...

It couldn't be...

Be careful, Polnareff.

Now he's telling me to pass!

Looks like he remembered
how shitty his car is.

You should have just stayed behind
me in the first place, dumbass.

What?!

A truck? That's impossible!

It's no use! We're going to crash!

Star Platinum!

Th-That was close!

If it weren't for Star Platinum's power,
we would have been crushed.

Where is it?! Where's that car?

Looks like it took off.

Do you think that car's driver might be
one of the Stand users that are after us?

Or do you think it's
just some random asshole?

Of course it's someone who's after us!

We were almost killed!

But there hasn't been anything
like a Stand attack yet.

Anyway, all we can do is be careful
as we head for the border.

If someone comes after us again,

we'll just take them down,
no matter who they are.

Yeah.

What should we do about that truck?

Star Platinum punched it,
so it's pretty messed up.

Just pretend you never saw it. Ignore it.

So cool... I'm gonna go crazy...

A roadside tea house...

Let's take a break.

If we take our time, we may
avoid running into that car.

What's that?

Sugarcane juice.

Wanna try some?

All right, then...

What?!

I-It's him!

That car's here!

Hey, I need to ask you something.

Where's the driver of that car parked over there?

I-I'm not sure. I didn't
notice when it parked there...

I doubt that the driver will just
come out and announce himself.

He's messing with us!

This leaves us with only
one option. Right, Jotaro?

Yeah...

It'll involve some innocent bystanders, but...

We'll just beat them all down!

H-Hey, Jotaro, stop!

Mr. Joestar, you too?! This is going too far!

A face like yours looks the most suspicious...

C-Come on!

D-Did we just get played?

Did anyone see his face?

N-No. What is he trying to do?

He seems like a random crazy driver,

but also like someone who's after us.

It's going to piss me off

if we don't chase him
down and take care of this.

Not to mention

we owe him payback for the truck
that almost hit us earlier!

Damn it! For a piece of shit car,
it goes pretty fast.

That's strange. According to the map,

we should be running
parallel with train tracks here.

Who the hell cares?

We're gonna catch him in a second.

That bastard!

I'm gonna nail him on that curve!

Impossible! It's a dead end!

He's gone! Where did he go?!

He disappeared after the curve?

And a car couldn't cross
that suspension bridge...

What?!

I-It's him!

He's coming from behind!

How did he get behind us?

H-He's pushing us with immense horsepower...

What the hell is this? A tank?!

It's no use! Everyone,
abandon the car and get out!

Polnareff!

What kind of driver gets out of
the car before everyone else?!

Who's going to hold down the brake pedal?

Huh?

S-S-Sorry!

Hierophant Green!

Fwoom

Stop!

Hierophant isn't strong enough
to hold this much weight!

It'll just tear its body apart!

I beg your pardon, Mr. Joestar,

but I know myself quite well.

I am not a fool.

It flew up holding the car's wire winch!

Hmph. Not bad, Kakyoin.

By the way, do you like sumo?

Especially deadlocks at the edge of the ring...

It's exciting, isn't it?

Ow...

Indeed. I quite enjoy sumo.

But Jotaro, in sumo, it's against
the rules to punch your opponent.

Star Platinum

Jotaro Kujo

Since I didn't see anything that
looked like a Stand attack,

I guess it was just some weirdo.

Yeah. Either way, he can't possibly survive.

Well, I guess he got what he deserved.

But I wonder why...

That car was suddenly behind us.

It's so strange.

It's not strange at all...

It's the radio!

It's coming from the car radio!

It was able to do that
because it's a Stand, Joestar!

What?!

If it knows my name, it must be one

of the Stand users that are after us!

Where is it coming from?

Could it be from the car that just fell?

That's impossible! That thing is totaled!

No, there's a possibility
the whole car is a Stand.

Just like the Stand for Strength was a boat.

The Wheel of Fortune...

That is the card my Stand suggests.

The Wheel of Fortune?!

What is that tremor?

This isn't good...

Everyone, get in the car!

No, don't!

Everyone get away from the car!

It can't be...

The ground!

Crash

Impossible! It burrowed up through the ground!

I think it's pretty obvious
that car is actually a Stand!

It appears that the Stand's user is inside.

What the hell?!

What is that thing?

It's like a living creature!

It transformed! It's going to attack!

Zoom

Hmph.

It wants to see who's stronger.

Don't, Jotaro. Don't fight yet!

Not until we know
what that Stand's power is!

Jotaro!

I-Impossible... I couldn't see it.

What did it shoot at me, and how?

You couldn't see it?

You'll soon find out...

When you're about to die, that is!

Jotaro!

Jotaro! Polnareff! Kakyoin!

What the hell is this?!

The wounds aren't deep,
but it's digging in!

I can't see it at all.

The Stand appeared to be throwing
something at us, but there's nothing

sticking out of our wounds.

Are you all right, Jotaro?

Don't worry about me. Anyway...

I don't know what kind of attack it is,

but it's got good control.

I'll go after your legs so
you can't run anymore,

and then run you over!

Run between the boulders!

Stop running away!

What?!

What the hell are you guys? Cockroaches?!

Oh, no! It's forcing its way in!

We're no match for it.

It's acting like some stupid musclehead
who couldn't figure out a puzzle ring,

so he just pitched a violent fit instead!

Head further back!

N-No one's carrying me!

Yeah, I ran away from home.

I'm a good-for-nothing!
I'm all alone and no one loves me!

I'll just die!

Good grief.

If you have time to say all that,
you can run, you little brat.

I love you, Jotaro!

Climb if you want.

There are literally no roads left for you!

Not for escape, not for survival, not for Egypt,

not even a road toward your shining future!

Because...

This

Wheel of Fortune is going
to grind you into hamburger

and splatter you all over these boulders!

Oh, no!

I-It's climbing up...

Is there anything this car can't do?!

Good grief.

Looks like we're going to have to face it.

Everyone, stay back.

Once it climbs up here,
we'll see the car's underside.

That's when we'll find out who's stronger.

I see. Once the car's underside is in view,

we may be able to attack it.

You're quite energetic, Jotaro!

But not smart at all!

Your bodies reek of something,

and you haven't even noticed!

Come to think of it, I smell gasoline.

It's our bodies!

Our bodies smell like gasoline!

It was shooting gasoline at us!

It was shooting small amounts of
gasoline at high speed, like bullets.

I-Impossible...

So his attacks weren't to wound us,

but to soak our bodies with gasoline?!

Looks like you finally caught on,
but it's too late now!

These electric wires will spark!

What?!

Jotaro!

Jotaro!

Don't go near him, Mr. Joestar!

There's gasoline on our bodies, as well.

Jotaro!

I win! Part Three is over!

Oh? And who exactly is going
to replace me, Jotaro Kujo?

You didn't think it'd be you, did you?

You burrowed into the
ground with Star Platinum!

So the only thing that
burned up was your jacket!

Hmph. By the way, weren't you
saying something about roads earlier?

You were wrong.

A road is something that you make yourself.

And so, I, Jotaro Kujo,
will show you how it's done.

I'll show you exactly how roads are built!

I-I'm being crushed...

Jotaro!

That's how it's done.

Where you went flying,
there is now literally a road.

Good, good.

What an odd character.

His arms were so huge,
and yet everything else is so small.

Talk about a bluff.

Hey! Don't you run away!

Don't kill me! I'm just in this for the money!

Oh, God.

To think that the Stand was
disguising such a small car, too.

It looks like a sheep that's just been shorn.

How pathetic.

I am a priest in training. Please do not disturb
my ascetic exercises by undoing my restraints.

Well, then. Let's take
this car across the border,

since our car was destroyed.

It's pretty beat-up.
I wonder if it'll last that long.

Help! Help!

By the way, you're going back
to Hong Kong on an airplane.

Aw, why?!

Shut up! Don't you get
that you're in the way?

We might not make it...

Help!

Wheel of Fortune

Zii Zii

Sob...

Sob, sob...

Sob, sob...

Sob, sob...

Sob, sob, sob, sob...

All of the seven Stand users
I sent have been defeated.

All of them have been crushed!

I cannot bear to face Lord DIO.

Curses! That hateful Polnareff! Kakyoin!

As well as Jotaro and that geezer Joestar!

I, Enyaba, will now face you personally!

With my own Stand, the Justice card!

Next Episode Preview

The fog is getting worse from over there.

They died with that look of fear on their face!

Why is that?

What is with everyone in this town?

This isn't an ordinary murder.

Joestar and company.

You seem to be travelers.

Assalamu alaikum.

My, that looks so good on you!

I've been working here for years,

but I've never gotten such
a strange request for clothes.

I'm in a hurry. What's the total?

See ya.

Th-Thank you...

Let go! Let go of me!

Don't touch me in weird places!

Shut up! Don't say it like that!

Here's the ticket.

No! I don't wanna!

I want to go with you guys!

Little Miss.

My daughter, who is Jotaro's mother...
Her life is in danger right now.

We're going on this journey
to save my daughter's life.

Give up on running away and go back home.

I'm sure your parents are worried.

There.

Fine. I'll make you look good this time, Grandpa.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

See ya! Life is just a bunch of goodbyes!

But I did sort of want to see
him again before I had to go.

Bye-bye, Jojo! You better
save your mom, no matter what!

I'll be cheering you on!

Indus River                          India

Pakistan is a young country,
established in 1947

following its separation from India.

But when primitive peoples
first began to live in Japan,

there was already civilization in Pakistan.

Here in Pakistan, the people
carry on the five thousand year

history of the Indian subcontinent.

Episode 14: Justice Part 1

But, Jotaro, I'm surprised you were
able to get someone to make you

a Japanese school uniform here in Pakistan.

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

The fit is perfect, too.

It's 100% wool.

Polnareff, is it safe to drive right now?

It appears the fog in this
area is getting quite thick.

Yeah. It might be a bit dangerous.

Since there's a sheer drop to
one side, and no guard rail.

Indeed. The fog gets thicker up ahead.

It's not even 3:00 yet,
but I guess we have no choice.

Let's find a place to stay
in that town for the night.

I wonder if there's a nice hotel.

A nice hotel?

One that has a decent toilet, of course!

I still can't get used to the
toilets in India and West Asia

where you wash yourself with your hands.

Was that a dog's corpse?

What's the matter, Jotaro?

No, it's nothing.

This is a nice little town.

I'd say it has a population of a few thousand.

Let's ask about a hotel
at that restaurant there.

But it sure is a weirdly quiet town...

Every other place has been
super crowded and noisy.

It's probably because of the fog.

Listen up, everyone.

In Pakistan, and further
west in the Islamic world,

this is how you greet people.

First, you smile and say...

Assalamu alaikum!

E-Er... You didn't have to
close up shop so suddenly...

We just wanted to ask a question.
Is there a hotel nearby?

Silence

Hello?

I don't know.

Huh?

Hey, wait a minute.
What do you mean, you don't know?

Wh-What's with that guy...?

I must have imagined it.

I'm sure he couldn't understand you
because your pronunciation's so bad.

Let's ask the guy sitting there.

Hey, guy! Sorry, but we're looking for a hotel.

Preferably a hotel with nice, clean toilets.

Do you know any...

Hey! You!

What's wrong?

What?!

They're dead! They died with
that look of fear on their faces!

Wh-What the hell is this?
Why are they lying dead in the road?

What was the cause of death?!

A heart attack? A stroke?

That could be... But it doesn't
seem to be ordinary heart failure.

A g-gun! This guy is holding a gun...

You just noticed?

There's smoke coming from it. He's fired it.

And it was just fired.
Maybe two to five minutes ago.

Either way, it was right
before we got to this town.

Was it suicide? Did he shoot himself?

No. There don't seem to
be any wounds on the body,

and there's no blood anywhere.

Then how'd this guy die? Look at him!

His face is distorted like he was
screaming in utter terror!

I don't know.

What did this man shoot with his gun?
What in the world is going on?

No one in the town noticed anything?

Excuse me, ma'am.

Someone has died here.
Please call the police.

Pardon. My acne seems to have festered.

By the way, did you need something?

I said I'd like you to call the police.

The police?

For what?

Look! There's a dead body over there!

Oh, my. There's a dead body?

Is there anything I can do?

I already asked you to call the police!

Right, right. Call the police...

All right.

My acne has festered and
it's so itchy. Terribly itchy...

What is with the people in this town?

Someone died and not a
single person even cares to look,

let alone a whole curious crowd.

Did they not even hear the gunshot?

These people are even more indifferent

than people in large cities
like New York or Tokyo.

That dog...

It feels like the fog just keeps getting thicker.

The town seems to be engulfed by this fog.

It's really creepy.

Doesn't that part there look like a skull?

What do you want to do, old man?

You don't think it's the work
of another Stand user, do you?

It seems impossible.

There's no motive.

Would someone who's after us kill a man

who has nothing to do with us,
before we even got here?

If they did, why did they kill him?

But there is a possibility.
His death seems pretty extraordinary.

Let's investigate the body

as much as we can without
touching it, before the police come.

Right...

It appears he was traveling, too, just like us.

He has bus and train tickets.

And he appears to be Indian.
He's carrying Indian money.

He's not from this town.

Oh?!

A wound!

Right under his throat, there's a wound
about the size of a 10 yen coin.

Is this the cause of death?

But why isn't there any blood coming from it?

With a hole this big, there should be

tons of blood gushing from it.

Normally, at least.

Looks like this is no ordinary murder.

We need to know. Let's not hold back.

Take off his clothes.

Bam

Wh-What's with this corpse?

There are holes all over it!

He looks like the cartoon cheese
you'd see in Tom & Jerry!

And there's no blood coming
from any of these holes.

How on earth was this man killed?
What does this all mean?!

Be careful.

The odds that there's a new
Stand user nearby just grew.

Everyone!

Get in the car! We're leaving this town!

What?!

That's impossible!

This isn't the car!

Hermit Purple!

Hey. Old man.

What the hell are you doing?
Are you stupid?

Oh, no!

What do you mean, what am I doing?!
The car was right here a minute ago!

What? Car?

We just parked the car over there.

What?!

B-But just now...

You seem to be travelers.

With this fog, it's dangerous
to leave the town now.

There are many cliffs, you know.

I run a little bed and breakfast.

If you'd like, why not stay there for the night?

I'll make it cheap.

We finally met a normal person!

Hermit Purple

Joseph Joestar

There's a strong possibility that

a Stand user is hiding somewhere in this town.

This thick fog also gives them the upper hand.

We cannot let our guard down at all tonight.

But... even without anyone attacking us,
this is a really creepy town.

Come now, Mr. Joestar. That is my hotel.

I shall lead the way. Please come with me.

This hotel is small...
but about twenty years ago,

one of the 007 films was filmed here,

and John Lennon from the
Beatles even stayed here once.

What? Really?!

No, not at all.

Wha?!

But it is still quite a nice hotel.

There are currently no other guests.

Would meat for dinner be all right?

Or would you prefer fish?

Hold it, old lady.

You just said "Joestar," didn't you?

How'd you know that name?

Come now, sir. That person there
just said "Mr. Joestar" a moment ago.

What? Me?

Well, I guess I might have.

You did, sir.

When you've been in customer
service for many years,

you learn to memorize
people's names quickly.

So I'm sure of it.

By the way, Ma'am,
what happened to your left hand?

Oh, this? I just burned it a little...

It might because of my old age,

but I accidentally spilled boiling water on it.

Age? What are you talking about?

You only look to be about forty.

Maybe I'll ask you on a date.

Please don't tease me so, sir.

What the hell are you saying, you fool?!

I hate you most of all, Polnareff!

I'll make sure you suffer a
thousand times what my son did

when I cut your dick off and
rip out your guts to kill you!

Oh, this doesn't look too bad.

Here, Kakyoin.

Right.

My autograph's worth as much as Lennon's.

Here.

Yeah.
I'm Paulnareff, after all!

Make sure you take care of it.

My, my...

I will do just that.

To commemorate your death!

It's done.

Well, then... I will show you to your rooms.

Man... Talk about a weird town.

All right, I'm going to the bathroom.

It appears to be broken.

Then I won't be able to use Hermit Purple to

get information on the enemy...

Hey, Mr. Joestar.

What's the matter?

Is there a bathroom in this room?

There doesn't seem to be one in mine.

Maybe the bathroom here is communal.

Oh, right!

Good grief. He's so carefree.

An unknown Stand user
could attack at any moment...

So, the Joestar party is on the third floor?

Hol Horse... So, you've come.

Yeah. I just now tracked them as far as this town.

But you surprised me, Enyaba.

I didn't think you'd come here yourself.

Wh-What's wrong, Enyaba?
You just started crying out of nowhere.

I-I am happy, Hol Horse!

Thank you for coming!

Thank you for coming to see
this lonely old woman!

I am very happy to see you!

Hol Horse, you were my
son's friend, were you not?

Friend?

Huh? Wha...

A-Ahem...

Yes, I certainly was.

Sob, sob. Were you close?

Close?

Yes! He was a dear friend.

We were an excellent team.

What's wrong? This isn't like you.

Will you avenge my son?
Is that why you've come?

Yes! That's exactly it!

I'm going to avenge my best friend!

That's why I'm so happy!

Swoop

Stab

Because I can kill you!

E-Enyaba?! Wh-What are you doing?!

How dare you abandon my son
to save yourself, Hol Horse?

I was determined to kill you
as soon as I saw you again.

My son's best friend? How dare you?!

W-Wait! You've got it all wrong!

When I got there,
Centerfold was already dead!

Unforgivable! You are as
unforgivable as Polnareff!

I'll have you die by the
hands of my Stand, Justice!

J-Justice?

I'm sure you've heard of it,
but haven't seen it yet...

I shall show you now, Hol Horse!

Th-The blood from my arm
where the scissors stabbed it...

It's going up into the fog...

Splort

A fine hole has appeared!

That's right. My Stand, Justice,
is a Stand made of fog.

Any wound touched by this fog
becomes a fine hole like this.

And then...

Justice wants to dance!

The fog has entered the
hole in your arm, like a string!

And now, you are my puppet!

Die by your own hand, Hol Horse!

Smash

Damn it! Don't get so cocky!

Emperor!

Die, you shitty old hag!

Justice will triumph!

What was that noise?

That room at the back of
the lobby is really loud...

Is something wrong, Polnareff?

I thought I heard a strange noise.

I'm going to take a look downstairs.

I'll be in the lobby,
so call me if you need me.

Curse you, Polnareff!

Next Episode Preview

I just saw him. He's in the bathroom.

Oh, the bathroom?

The bathroom is just past that door.

I thought I just heard someone say "toilet."

I always seem to get attacked in bathrooms...

Episode 15: Justice Part 2

Polnareff... I want to kill you!

I want to avenge my son
by ripping out your insides!

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

Hey, old lady!
But I can't let him find
Hol Horse's corpse right now.

She's not behind the counter, either.

It'll be even worse if
the other three show up.

I need to kill them one by one, damn it.

Go away for now!

Old lady, are you here?

I thought I heard some kind of crash.

Is everything okay?

I'm coming in, old lady.

Whoa!

Ouch...

What happened, old lady?

Oh, it's nothing.

I just fell and banged my hip.

You fell?

That's really dangerous. You
recently burned your left hand, too.

You sure are careless.

Thank you for your concern.
I'm sorry... I'll be fine.

No problem at all.

Get out!

Who said you could come in here, damn it?!

I'll spare you my wrath for now...

But later on, I'll kill you
just like I killed Hol Horse!

I just need to give you a little wound...

And I can make you a puppet
for my Justice to control!

There we go... Here's your staff.

What? You seem to be sweating a lot.

No, really, don't worry about me.

Please just go rest in your room.

Are you sure?

But, are you running
this hotel all by yourself?

Don't you have any other family?

A son, maybe?

Huh? What was that?

E-Er, I was just saying I've
gotten used to living alone.

I see...

But isn't it lonely?

Like, say your son had a wife.

Your grandkids could run
around happily in the lobby.

It'd be a little noisy, but...

Aren't families great?

If you had kids, would they be older than me?

What's wrong?

Did they move to the big city, or something?

N-No. They've passed away.

Oh, I'm so sorry.
I've been totally rude, then...

You're the asshole that killed him, god damn it!

I'm going to kill you! Kill you!

Here, have a seat.

Want me to rub your shoulders?

I'm alone, too.

I lost my mother when I was really young.

This makes me think of my mom...

Tonight,

you can think of me as your son...

and ask anything you want of me.

You stupid little brat!

Maybe I should kill you right now after all!

Wow, you're really tense.

I guess it's really been tough on you.

Wh-Who is that?

H-Hol Horse? You're still alive?

You must have made your
Stand disappear as soon as it

shot the bullet into your mouth!

Th-That face!

Menacing

P-Polnareff! Behind you...

You're Hol Horse!

Wha—

What are you doing?!

Shut up! I'm the mother of
Centerfold, whom you killed!

Chariot!

Why, you... You're a Stand user?!

All those responsible for
my son's murder will die!

M-Mr. Joestar!

It's too late.

I've already made sure that
you can't contact the other three.

Because...

I've summoned them.

Who the hell are you guys?!

Y-You're...

The Indian traveler we found dead

as soon as we got to town...

These corpses are moving?!

This is my Stand, Justice's ability!

No one can have more than one Stand,
but Justice is a fog Stand

that can control corpses!

It can control hundreds, even thousands!

Aren't you taking this
unjustified grudge a bit far?

To think that such a twisted
Stand user was after us...

The whole town's trying to kill you.

A-And if you get wounded, this will happen...

I just need to give you a little scratch.

Just a little one.

Then my Stand, Justice, will kill you!

Get him!

I'm outta here!

Polnareff! Don't leave me here!

Oh, shut up! Did you forget about Avdol?

I have no obligation to help you!

You can just die there!

I'm not letting you get away, Polnareff!

I'll yank your brain out!

I'll break your spine in half!

I'll crush you to death!

I will get vengeance for my son!

How terrifying!

Can an old woman really run this fast?!

Take this!

Damn it! He ran into the back room!

After him! Break down that door!

Wh-What the hell...

This is a hallway leading
down to the basement.

Even if I try to contact
Mr. Joestar and the others,

I'm so far away now, they'd never hear me!

I don't think I'd lose if
I fought on my own, but...

If I get even a scratch on me, I'll be in trouble.

She'll open a hole in me, and control me.

D-Damn it... Isn't there a way outside?

I can't get out the windows
since there are bars on them.

Damn it...

I'll hide in this room.

That's the sound of the door breaking...

A-At this rate, I'm going to have to fight.

But I can't let them land even one scratch on me.

I hear them walking down the hallway.

They must be checking the other doors.

Damn it, they're getting
closer and closer to here.

Not to mention... What the hell?

Now that I look at it,
is this room a bathroom?

I always seem to get attacked in bathrooms...

Damn it, the toilet is so dirty...

All right, come at me.

But the second you walk in, my Chariot
will chop up four of you in a single breath.

Wh-What?

Now I don't hear anything.

Those things... That old hag...

What the hell are they doing?

Aren't they going to break down the door?

What the hell are they doing?

React in some way, damn it!

Squirm

They were looking in from the other side!

What the hell?!

Sh-Shit...

He stabbed me in the tongue!

Well done! You've finally
fallen under my Justice's control!

You shitty little brat!

Now if you don't open that door
and come out on your own,

I'm going to crush your face, you dumbass.

Laugh!

How very pitiful, Polnareff.

Very pitiful, indeed!

But because of your cowardly
actions, my son, Centerfold,

died feeling even sadder and more pitiful!

Well, now... How about we
have you clean the bathroom,

Polnareff?

Lick the toilet until it's clean.

Lick it all up!

Lick it all up...

Like that!

A-Anything but that...

Anything but that!

Help...

Wh-What is it?

You just walked in without knocking...

What do you need?

I'm looking for Polnareff.

And I did knock.

Maybe you didn't hear me because you

were too busy doing something else,

old lady.

Justice

Enyaba

Menacing

I'm looking for Polnareff. Have you seen him?

What should I do?

Unlike Polnareff, this Jotaro is clever,
and knows the right questions to ask.

The moment I act dumb,
he'll think that I'm suspicious.

So troublesome.

I'll tell him the truth, and as soon
as he turns his back to me,

I'll stab him with these scissors!

After that, my Stand will beat him to death.

Yes, of course.

I know exactly where Mr. Polnareff is, Mr. Jotaro.

Oh?

Crap... Jotaro doesn't know

that even the smallest scratch will spell his doom.

D-Don't come here!
Go tell Mr. Joestar and Kakyoin!

That old lady is the Stand user!

He was just here. He's in the
bathroom now, Mr. Jotaro.

Oh, he's in the bathroom?
Is it inside this door here?

Yes, that's right.

Just go through that door,

and it's the last door at the end of the hall.

You fool! You are a child, after all!

If I kill Polnareff, it'll make
my son in heaven happy!

If I kill Jotaro, it'll make
Lord DIO in Egypt happy!

Oh, that's right.

I forgot to ask, old lady...

Oh? What's wrong, old lady?
You just fell down.

Did you trip on something?

Th-That was too close...

Oh, yeah, that's really dangerous.

Falling while holding scissors...

Thank goodness something terrible didn't happen.

Thank goodness.

Sorry to ask before you even get up,
but I have more questions for you.

Why did you just call me Jotaro?

I never told you my name,

and no one's said my name in front of you.

That's what I want to know.

Well, answer me.

Maybe it's because I liked Columbo as a kid,

but when something bothers me,
I can't even sleep at night.

Wh-Why do you suspect me?

The hotel register!

You wrote your name on
the hotel register earlier!

It's so dry in here.

You wrote "Jotaro Kujo."

Oh?

You mean this thing?

Yes, that exact thing!

"Qtaro Kujo"?

"Jotaro" isn't written anywhere.

I suspected you from the moment you
called me "Joestar" when we first met.

I told the others not to use my name.

And yet, you knew my name... Which means...

It's no use playing stupid.

I already know you're one of the
Stand users that's after us, old hag.

Menacing

Well, what's wrong?

Aren't you going to show me your Stand?

I've already shown it to you!

My Stand, Justice, will win!

I just need one spot! One little spot!

You've fallen into my trap, Jotaro!

Polnareff!

Jotaro, it's me, Hol Horse!

Enyaba's Stand is a fog Stand.

Your wound will turn into a hole like mine,

and she'll control you with the fog.

She can even control corpses!

Shut your mouth, Hol Horse!

Can you punch fog with your fist?

Can you cut fog with your sword?

Can you shoot fog with your gun?

Futile! Absolutely futile!

You guys can't do anything!

Th-That's the ultimate Stand!

Our little Stands don't stand a chance.

There's nothing that can defeat that Stand.

Yes, yes, keep them coming.

Say more things like that.

Now I'll control you, too, Jotaro!

R-Run, Jotaro! You'll get a hole in your leg!

Good grief.

There's no reason to run.

Before that old hag takes another breath,

I'll defeat that Stand.

Oh? What was that?

Before I do what one more time?
You stupid little brat!

Before I take another breath?

I'll do that right—

Just once...

What...?

Jotaro's Star Platinum has
begun inhaling Justice's face...

P-Please stop...

...and he's holding it in!

Whoosh

At this rate, she won't be able to breathe!

Well, now...

It looks like her head is full of

the fog she liked so much.

I'm so angry...!

Why does it even matter
what I've been licking?

You ask such stupid things.

Cough, cough, the toilet, cough...

Eh? You were licking what, again?

I couldn't hear that very well.

Who cares what it was?

I want to disinfect my tongue.

Just give me the medicine already.

Hm? I thought I just heard "toilet"...

Actually, I already know.

But I can't resist picking on him about this!

Hey! Did Jotaro already tell you?!

You shitty old man!

You were just messing with me!

Forget about the medicine!

All right, all right. My bad.

I'll fix you right up, Polnareff.

If you don't take care of that,
it'll get infected.

Ahem! Toilet. Ahem...

You licked a toilet...

Damn it! Let's hurry back on
our journey! Jotaro! Kakyoin!

Everyone, come outside.

What on earth?

We step outside of the hotel,
and this place is...

It's a graveyard.

She was using her Stand's fog

to make this graveyard look
like a town, and a hotel?

So we were talking to the corpses

that were buried in these graves...

Star Platinum

Jotaro Kujo

T-Take her with us? The old lady?

Yeah.

We need to know how many
more Stand users there are,

what their powers are,

where in Egypt DIO is hiding...

And what DIO's Stand's power is.

If we're able to get the old lady

to tell us what it is,

it'll give us a definite advantage.

I doubt that she'd be willing to tell us, though...

We just need to use my Hermit Purple

to project what she's thinking onto a TV.

Oh, right!

Since there isn't a TV in this graveyard,

we'll do it in the next town.

Hol Horse!

That bastard!

Our car!

Yeah, I'm gonna stick with DIO after all.

See ya later!

Provided you guys don't die first, that is.

But I'll give you a warning!

You should kill that old
lady as quick as you can.

Otherwise, that old lady'll show you

just how terrifying DIO really is.

See ya!

What the hell is he talking about?

Why are you here in front of me?

Lord DIO will never...

They should be able to become smaller.

When I say I'm going to do something...

He just went flying like the other guy!

Oh, God!

You don't need power to kill humans...

Hey, a doner kebab place!

Why don't we stop and get something to eat?

Doner kebabs are the
hamburgers of the Middle East!

A slab of meat is placed on a spit,
and its surface roasts as it turns.

They then shave off the cooked meat

and eat it on bread.

It is quite a delicious dish.

Excuse me. I'd like five of those.

Five will cost you a thousand yen.

A thousand yen?

In the Middle East, the logic of Japan and

the West doesn't apply at all.

Namely, prices are very unspecific.

Foreigners who come here for the first time,

with no understanding of the art of haggling,

have no idea what things cost
and are easily exploited.

But in this world, such exploitation
is not seen as a bad thing.

The one who was tricked into
buying is seen as an idiot.

I will now explain how to buy things!

A thousand yen?

In this situation, for instance,
act like you see through the trick...

Don't mock me, now! That's far too much.

...and laugh out loud. And then...

How much would you buy them for?

...they will ask the customer
how much they're willing to pay.

Make it 250 yen for five!

In return, the customer names a price so low,

you'd feel a bit guilty even saying it. And then...

They'll take the attitude,
"Seriously? Have you no sense?"

and act as though you're mocking them...

If I sold them for that much,
my whole family would starve to death!

Then they will gesture as if
their head were being cut off.

But you mustn't give up yet.

Then maybe I'll just buy them somewhere else.

Act like you're leaving...

Okay, friend! I'm very kind to foreigners.

I'll sell you five for 700 yen.

...and they'll say that to try and stop you.

Make it 300.

Let the haggling begin!

600!

350!

550!

400!

450!

425!

I'll take them!

All right! I got them for less
than half his original price!

Take that! I made out like a bandit!

And just as you think that...

I usually sell five for 150 yen!

Bye-bye, thank you!

Hey! That old lady's awake.

Eh?

I-I... I haven't said anything!

Wh-Why are you here before me?

Do you think that I, Enyaba,

would actually tell them
the secret of Lord DIO's Stand?

Huh?

Menacing

Wh-What the hell are these tentacles?!

Why...

Why have you come to kill me?!

It means that Lord DIO truly trusts no one.

I will be making sure you never speak again.

And as for you four there...

I will be taking your lives.

Old lady!

What?!

My name is Dan...

Dan of Steel.

My Stand suggests The Lovers card.

I will see to it that you all
meet the same fate as Enyaba.

How could you?!

That old lady was one of you, wasn't she?

Old lady!

L-L-Lies... Lies...

It's a lie...

Lord DIO would never do this to me....

The thing coming out of the
old lady's body is not a Stand!

They're real! They're real, moving tentacles!

He would never do something like this to me...

He would never plant a flesh bud...

Flesh bud?!

Lord DIO is my reason to live...
We trust each other...

Old lady!

Th-They...

They melted from the rays of the sun.

The flesh bud! It's DIO's own cells!

Precisely! I'm impressed you
were able to figure that out.

That is what the flesh bud,
made from Lord DIO's cells,

looks like when it's grown.

I just grew it inside of Enyaba.

Enyaba, I hear that you were the one

who told Lord DIO about the Stands.

But there is no way that Lord DIO

would ever trust a little
old woman like yourself.

It seems you hadn't realized that.

Old lady!

Tell us what the true
identity of DIO's Stand is!

Tell us!

You placed your hope and trust in DIO!

And now you know he's not
the man you thought he was!

I have to defeat DIO! Please, tell me!

Tell me! Tell me about DIO's Stand!

Lord... DIO...

He believes in me.

I can't tell you...

Oh, God!

How sad...

How truly sad that old woman was.

But the fact that she trusted him so deeply

shows how powerful Lord DIO's evil charm truly is.

Since Enyaba was connected with my sister's death,

I'm pretty conflicted about this.

But I will kill you.

It'll be four against one,
but we won't hesitate.

Prepare yourself.

Stand up.

Hey, jackass!

Don't try to act cool at a time like this.

Even if you won't attack us, we're going to fight.

Do as you please.

But none of you will

be able to even lay a
finger upon me, Dan of Steel.

Smash

What?!

Wh-What happened, Mr. Joestar?

He flew back just like that guy!

You fool! I was still in the
middle of my explanation.

You were very close to killing
your own grandfather.

Listen carefully.

Do you really think I appeared
before you just to kill Enyaba?

Y-You bastard...

You said you had the Stand
of the Lovers' card, didn't you?

Wh-What is that?!

The battle has already begun, Mr. Joestar.

You fools...

No matter how hard you look,
you won't be able to find my Stand easily.

Hey, brat.

I'll give you a tip,
so hit my leg with your broom.

I-It can't be...

Hit me!

What happened, Mr. Joestar?!

I-It hurts!

I don't know what's going on,
but there's tremendous pain...

You haven't figured it out, Joseph Joestar?

My Stand goes inside the bodies of others.

The moment Enyaba died,
it entered your brain through your ear.

What?

Meaning, the Stand and
myself are one and the same.

If my Stand gets hurt, so do I, and vice versa.

If you so much as scratch me,

my Stand, which is within your brain,
will react to my pain and suffering

in that same moment by going berserk.

It will inflict pain several times greater
to the same part of your body.

I'll say it once more...

You will not be able to
lay a single finger on me!

Not to mention, The Lovers has
taken Lord DIO's flesh bud into your body.

It's growing within your brain.

Just like Enyaba, it will eat you
from the inside and you will die!

Ow!

When did I say you could strike me again?

You little brat!

Well, to be honest, my Stand,
The Lovers, is very weak.

It isn't powerful enough to
move even a single strand of hair...

It is the world's weakest Stand.

But...

You don't need power to kill humans.

Do you understand, gentlemen?

The Lovers

Dan of Steel

If I were to be in a car accident,
hit by a baseball,

or even to trip and fall, Mr. Joestar...

Your body would suffer far
greater damage than mine.

I-I can even feel real pain
in my artificial left hand...

And in ten minutes,

your brain will be eaten through,
and you will die like Enyaba.

Jotaro, calm down! Don't do anything stupid.

No. I'm going to kill him so quickly,
he won't have a moment to feel pain.

Without a moment to feel pain, huh...

That's a great idea.

Let's see you try it, Jotaro.

It sounds fascinating.

What were you planning to destroy?

Come on! My face? My throat?

Come on, what's wrong? Just try it!

Let's just see what happens!

How about busting a hole through my chest?

Or how about you give
up on using your Stand,

and crack my head open with a rock?

Here, I'll even get the rock for you.

Is this one big enough?

You don't want to underestimate me.

When I say I'm going to do something, I do it.

Don't do anything rash, Jotaro!

You've already seen his powers!

Are you trying to kill your own grandfather?!

H-He's the type that might actually do it...

You aren't taking me seriously.

Oh...?

You...

Jotaro!

Don't underestimate me, you bastard.

After the geezer Joestar dies, next it'll be...

Look out!

...your brain that I send The Lovers into and kill!

Wh-What the hell are you doing?!

H-How can this be?

My grandson is being beaten up to save me...

We're completely caught up in his pace.

His Stand is inside my brain...

When I was younger, there was a time when
poison was placed into my heart, but...

I must do something... I must do something!

H-Hey!

Jotaro! Keep him away from Mr. Joestar!

We're going to get as far
away from him as possible!

Oh, I see...

So you think that if you move far enough away,

my Stand's power will disappear?

But one's weakness can also be one's strength.

My Stand, The Lovers, may be weak,
but once it is within a body,

I can control it from a distance
far greater than any other Stand.

Even hundreds of kilometers away.

Hey, Jotaro! I'm talking to you!

What are you looking away so calmly for?

Look at me!

You sound like you're starting to lose your cool.

Do you plan to follow me until Joseph dies?

Dan, was it?

I will definitely make you pay for this.

If that's why you're following me,

maybe I should borrow a little more.

Is this all you have?

I see that your watch, audaciously
enough, is a TAG Heuer...

I'll be borrowing this.

There!

It's an electronics store!
Mr. Joestar, they have TVs!

H-Hey! What are you trying to do?

Polnareff, did you think
we were just running away?

I'm going to fight the
Stand that's inside my head.

F-Fight?!

We only have a few minutes.
You'll be assisting us.

Huh?!

Hermit Purple!

There it is!

Oh, no!

How can it be that I had to
see inside my own brain?

I-I can see now that
there's a really tiny Stand

inside of you, Mr. Joestar...

But how do you plan on defeating it?

Your Stand and mine will enter
Mr. Joestar's body, and defeat it there.

Wh-What?!

Stands are images made of energy.

They should be able to shrink.

Kakyoin!

Hey, take it easy on me.

There's no time to lose.
We're going in, Polnareff!

A-All right!

Hierophant Green!

Silver Chariot!

Smaller!

Get smaller.

We're going to be entering a blood vessel.

R-Right...

A drainage ditch...

I could jump across this ditch,

but if I were to trip and twist my
ankle, it could be dangerous.

It'd be a pain to go all the way
to that bridge over there.

Hey, Jotaro.

Lie down across this ditch
and make yourself into a bridge.

I'll walk over it on you.

What? You're not going to be my bridge?

What the hell are you talking about?

I said, make yourself into a bridge!
You ridiculous bastard!

Wh-What's wrong?!

Mr. Joestar!

M-My leg...

I-It's going numb...

What the hell is Jotaro doing?!

What's the matter, Jotaro?

Come on, hurry up.

Good.

You're a rather sturdy bridge, aren't you?

Aren't you? Aren't you?

Aren't you?

Aren't you?

Aren't you...

Mr. Joestar,

the enemy's Stand, The Lovers,

is in the brain stem, the point
where the nervous system begins.

Polnareff and I will enter the
vein from inside your ear,

then swim through the blood
vessels toward the brain stem.

Polnareff, open a hole in the
wall of the blood vessel.

H-Hey, hold on a second!
You're using your Stands, right?

Can't you just slip through it?

At this size, it's not possible.

The blood vessel's wall is too thick.

The hole will be microscopic,
so there's no need to worry.

Cutting through a blood
vessel or nerve right now

would take several minutes.

Otherwise, our Stands would have
already cut down the enemy Stand.

Though we may have already started...

Keeping our Stands this
small is really exhausting.

It requires a lot of Stand power.

Here we go!

Oh, my God! I-I don't feel so well...

My back itches...

I'm in a really good mood right now.

How about I have you lick it for me?

Episode 17: The Lovers, Part 2

You made a nice bridge, Jotaro.

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

Hey, Jotaro. My back itches.

Scratch it!

A little lower.

Lower...

Yeah, that's it.

Don't dig your nails in so much.

Mr. Joestar?

Hey, what's wrong?

I-It feels like someone's tickling my back...

I can't concentrate on my Stand like this!

Mr. Joestar!

Wh-When did all of these people show up?

Mr. Joestar, keep your voice down!

People are staring!

Everyone will think you're nuts!

I-I'm not yelling for the fun of it!

Oh, no!

Poor man...

Let's give him some change.

What is this?

It's not easy having an older relative like that.

You said it.

Kakyoin, go buy the TV.

Let's get out of this crowd.

R-Right.

Are you the owner?

Eh? Yes...

I'd like that TV.

I can't believe Kakyoin's
Hierophant and Polnareff's Chariot

have shrunk themselves
and entered Joestar's body.

They're trying to fight me?

I can see it!

I can see where they'll exit

the artery wall that leads to
the brain stem, and The Lovers.

Over here!

We only have minutes left before the flesh bud

eats through Mr. Joestar's brain!

Hurry, you two!

There we go.

All right!

Now, Mr. Joestar!

Hermit Purple!

Th-This is...

These tentacles are part the flesh bud!

We finally got to the brain stem,

but the flesh bud's already grown so much.

Damn it!

It's him!

L-Look!

He's using his scissor-like hands to
knead Mr. Joestar's brain cells

into a gooey mash, so he can
feed them to the flesh bud!

If we can't beat him and sever
all the flesh bud's roots quickly,

it'll grow big enough to eat through his brain!

All right! I'll cut them apart!

No, not cut... I'll grate them!

Like a daikon radish!

Swish! Swish! Swish!

You bastard!

Now's our chance!

Slash

We did it!

N-No, that wasn't enough!

That thing's pretty fast, Kakyoin.

But I've already seen through his moves.

If that's the best he can move,
he's no match for...

Polnareff!

Who are you talking to?

H-Huh?

Polnareff, that's not me.

And what you cut wasn't the Stand.

Its form is breaking apart.

Wh-What?!

I'm The Lovers!

Polnareff!

It was disguised!

It used the brain cells...

Mr. Joestar's brain cells!

He was using the mash of kneaded brain cells

to disguise himself as my Hierophant Green!

And what you defeated was merely
a dummy made of brain cells!

You were completely fooled, you idiots!

Come on!

What are you doing?

Shine those shoes right, Jotaro!

I'm in such a good mood right now!

I need you to shine my shoes until
they're as bright as I feel right now.

I want the sunny sky to
reflect right off of them.

If you want, you can use
your uniform to shine them.

Actually, why not lick them clean?

Hey! You bastard!

What are you writing?!

Punched in the gut
Hit with a rock
Stole my wallet
Stole my watch
Walked on, like a bridge, over a dirty river

I'm writing down everything you owe me.

Made me scratch his back
Made me shine his shoes
Kicked me

I'm going to make sure you pay it.

I can be forgetful, so I'm writing it all down.

Jotaro, you bastard...

Well, whatever. It won't matter in the end.

Whoa! Kakyoin, look!

Look at that dummy's head!
The one I just cut open!

Wh-What in the world...

He's splitting into two!

Listen up.

In this world, the one
who knows himself best wins!

In Aesop's fable,
the tortoise beats the hare,

because the tortoise knew his own
psyche and abilities better than anyone!

The same goes for me.

I know that I lack the power or speed necessary

to mortally wound either of you.

Everything begins

once you've acknowledged your own weaknesses!

Emerald Splash!

Did it work?

M-More dummies made out of brain cells...

They're multiplying!

B-But a person can only have
one Stand. Only one is real!

Wh-Where's the real one?!

Right here!

Emerald Splash!

So close! I was right next to that one.

The more we hit the wrong ones,
the more it multiplies!

No, no...

It's me...

It's me! It's me! It's me! It's me!

It's me, after all!

Polnareff, that's enough!

Withdraw your Stand.

I can't bear to watch you get hurt
for the sake of my brain.

Damn it!

I can't stand the thought
of leaving things like this.

Withdraw your Stand!
You're going to get killed!

Not to mention...

There's no more time...

Don't give up until the very end, Mr. Joestar!

I can't tell!

I can't tell the difference!

Which one is the real one?

Which one is the Stand?!

Which one is it?!

The weakest of all is also

the most, most,

most, most, most, most,

most, most terrifying of all!

Say, Jotaro. Take a look at this gold bracelet.

It would make a girl happy,

if you were to give her something like this.

Jotaro,

see that space in the glass?

Use your Stand to sneak through and steal it!

I told you to steal it, you dumbass!

Hurry it up!

Or...

I don't mind breaking the glass and taking it myself.

Are you okay with them catching me
and beating the shit out of me?

Joseph would definitely die from the pain.

Hurry up!

The salesman's looking the other way!

This guy's shoplifting!

You bastard...

The Lovers

Dan of Steel

This guy's shoplifting!

Hey, salesman!

Sir! Please don't let him get away!

Sure!

You bastard...

What? A thief?

Who is it?

That guy?

That Asian kid?

Back where I come from,

they chop a thief's fingers off!

Hey, Jotaro.

You better not use your Stand against civilians.

Bastard!

Take this!

Despicable!

You thief!

Get out of our country, asshole!

We'll let you go at that.
You can keep your fingers!

That was great! Well done!

Because of the commotion you caused,

I was able to get my hands
on something even better!

Jotaro!

What the hell are you laughing about?

What's so funny?

I'm laughing in anticipation
of the fun that's to come.

I'm laughing because I have much more
to look forward to now, and I'm excited!

I'm so excited for the moment
when I get to pay you back.

Why, you...!

You seem to misunderstand.

Old Man Joestar will die within seconds.

That's the reality you're facing.

Nah. You don't know us very well.

You don't know Kakyoin.

What?!

"Everything begins once you've
acknowledged your own weaknesses," eh?

I see...

I'd have to agree with that.

To know yourself is an important lesson...

But you clearly don't know
your enemies well enough.

You haven't done your research.

Didn't you realize?

My Hierophant...

can spread its roots along the ground,

so I can inspect every single one of you!

Something's suddenly touching me!

You're the Stand!

Emerald Splash!

Bang

We did it!

Well, well, well, well...

That injury means that
Kakyoin's on the attack now.

I wonder if I'll still have my chance
at payback once he's done.

He's realized he's out of his league!
He's trying to escape into the artery!

He's trying to escape!

He's trying to get out of Mr. Joestar's brain!

Huh? He's leaving?

All right! That's great!

Mr. Joestar, hurry! The flesh bud!

Right!

Over Drive!

The flesh bud is disappearing!

I-I'm saved...

Now we can be more
buddy-buddy with Mr. Joestar.

Polnareff, you know...

Oh! B-But wait...

If it's leaving my brain,

that means the Stand...

...is going back to its user, Dan of Steel!

That's not good! Jotaro doesn't know that!

What's wrong? Why are you stepping back?

You're not going to tell me about
what's happening to my grandfather?

Hey, hey, hey...

What are you so panicked about?

Where are you trying to go?

You aren't trying to run away, are you?

Not after all this...

Please forgive me, Jotaro, sir!

I admit defeat!

I'll change! I'll lie on the ground and lick your boots!

I did an awful thing!

You can hit me as much as
you'd like! Hit me! Kick me!

But please, spare my life!

Lick, lick, lick, lick,

lick, lick, lick, lick, lick...

Soon...

The Lovers will soon be back!

This idiot, Jotaro, doesn't have a clue!

This time I'll invade your brain from your ear!

Kakyoin's several hundred
meters away. Just you wait!

I'll give you pain that will make
you wish you were dead!

I-It's here!

It's here! It's here! It's here! It's here!

Now! Go in!

I figured you were planning something like this.

Don't you know that my Stand, Star Platinum,

possesses excellent
eyesight and precise reflexes?

Are you sure you did your research on us?

I-I-I'm not planning anything!

Your Stand's power...

"Your" Stand? Just "your"?

N-No! I-I meant your majesty's
Stand is more powerful

and more just than any other!

I didn't stand a chance, so it came back!

P-Please look!

That attack broke my arm and my leg!

I can't fight anymore! I can't move!

Well...

As for what you owe me...

I guess I'll take your
arm and leg as payment.

Do you swear that you'll
never appear before us again?

I-I do! I swear!

I'll go to some deserted island!

I'll go to the ends of the Earth
and never come back!

You're not lying, are you?

The next time I see you,
I'll punch you one thousand times.

I'm not lying! I'd never lie!

Get out of here.

Let's play soccer over there!

But then I can't play!

Jotaro!

You fool!

Take a look at that girl over there!

My Stand, The Lovers,
just went into that girl's ear.

He's heading for her brain.

Don't you dare move, Jotaro!

I'm going to stab you in
the back with this knife!

I'll make sure you never move again!

Just try to attack me
with your Star Platinum!

That girl will surely die!

You would never kill such
a young child, would you?

Good grief. Fine, try it.

Hey! Don't you understand?!
I told you not to—

—move? Move...

Huh? Huh?!

What's the matter?

Weren't you going to stab me?

Like this?

M-My body won't move! Why?!

Wh-What's this thing wrapped around me?!

So you didn't notice?

Kakyoin tied Hierophant's tentacle

to your Stand's leg as it escaped.

You must be totally oblivious
if you didn't realize that

you left a trail all the way to here.

Please forgive me!

Ask for forgiveness from Enyaba,
the woman you killed.

We never had any intention of
forgiving you in the first place.

D-DIO paid me in advance...
I-I'll give you that.

Good grief.

You truly are the lowest scum in history.

You can't pay back what you owe

with money.

Here's your receipt.

Jotaro Kujo

I have this feeling like
someone is staring at us,

so I keep looking back.

Are you sure you're not just being paranoid?

I can't help but feel that presence, too.

I really can't shake the feeling
that someone's staring at us.

Something's strange. Something...

Episode 18: The Sun

Now, once you sign this,

you'll be under contract.

Here, right?

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

Man... If a cute girl like you asked me to,

I might even buy them a car.

My, what a talker.

How about we get dinner sometime?

Polnareff, I'm terribly sorry to
interrupt when you're so busy, but...

Mr. Joestar!

We're leaving.

Come on! Don't mess with the hair.

It's really hard to get this hairdo right.

Who cares about your hairdo?

We need you to drive.

Righto.

Bye, Mademoiselle.

But, man, Mr. Joestar,
why are we riding in such a fancy,

expensive car in this sandy place?

Why not get an off-road vehicle?

You'll find out soon enough.

But, man, I can't believe this country.

Every house we see is like a mansion.

Indeed.

All the houses around here would

cost 3 or 4 billion yen in Tokyo.

Apparently, this is the norm for the people here.

Just twenty years ago, this was all desert,

but thanks to massive profits from the oil crisis,

this place grew into a dream-like city.

The sun is harsh,

but with air conditioning, it's
perfectly comfortable inside the car.

No complaints here.

Oh?

What's wrong, Kakyoin?

I-It's nothing.

The view here is amazing.

If anyone were after us,
I'm sure we'd spot them,

but I feel like someone's watching us,
so I can't help looking back.

Yeah, I can't blame you.

Well, with that in mind,

I've been thinking about our route from here.

About 100 kilometers northwest
is a village called Yarpline.

Because of the desert and mountains,
the road is heavily curved.

It takes two days to reach by car,

so the villagers use a Cessna to travel.

I think we should go to the village first,

buy a Cessna, and cross the
vast Saudi Arabian desert.

Up to now, I've been worried
that attacks by Stand users

would cause any airplane we rode in to crash,

putting innocent lives at risk.

But if we have a Cessna, I can pilot it,

and it'll shorten our travel time.

I don't really want to board a Cessna with a man

who's been through three plane crashes.

Well, anyway,

I think we should first cross this desert

to get to the village of Yarpline.

On camels, it would take one day.

Camels?!

A Cessna's one thing, but wait a minute!

I've never ridden a camel before.

Leave it to me.

I know them very well.
I'll teach you how to ride.

Just sit back and relax.

You want camels?

Sure, but they're pretty expensive

and not easy to care for.

We're in a serious, life-or-death situation,

so we need them, whatever it takes.

As for payment, how about a trade for that car?

What?!

That's way too much, sir.

Yeah, Mr. Joestar!

Besides, you just bought that car!

Why else do you think I bought
such a fancy, expensive car?

An off-road vehicle is better in the desert.

But I wouldn't be able to
write a check in a place like this,

and they don't trust cash here.

In a place like this, trading is far more effective.

If you try to buy safety for cheap
in a time of emergency,

you'll end up even worse off in the end.

Well, it just means we've suffered a lot already.

Hey, Mister.

Huh?

This seals the deal, right?

Oh, I know. To make things more even,

I'd like the water in those tanks there.

In a desert, that's the most important thing.

Water is cheap compared to that car.

You sure are an odd one.

All right, everyone. Let's get ready.

Crossing a desert is a tough task.

Let's keep our wits about us!

I-It stinks!

Hey, Mr. Joestar.

How do you get on it?

It's, like, three meters tall.

Well, you see, with camels...

You make them sit first, and then get on.

You make them sit first, and then get on...

You make them sit, then get on!

J-Just one moment.
It's gonna sit down right now.

Hey! Sit! Sit down!

Damn it, you stubborn animal!

Hey, you have ridden one of these before, right?

I've seen that really long movie,
Lawrence of Arabia, three times!

I know very well how to ride a camel!

Though, two of those times,
I slept through half of it...

M-Movie?!

What? You've never actually ridden one?

It's great sunscreen! Didn't you know that?

Listen up...

When dealing with animals, it's
important to understand how they feel.

Exactly how they feel!

Here, doesn't this apple look delicious?

It's tasty!

Come on, come on...

Good boy...

Look! See?! It sat down!

If you take time to understand the camel,
it'll sit down for you!

I did it!

It's so high up!

They can close their nostrils to keep sand out.

Just don't make any stupid jokes

like "Once you get over the hump,
it's easy," or they'll kick you.

All right. Now I'll tell you what to
be careful with when riding camels.

Listen up.

Camels don't walk like horses.

The front and back leg on the same side

move forward together, so they sway a lot.

So just ride with that rhythm.

Like this!

Hey, wait! T-Too fast!

L-Listen to me...

Not that way, I said!

All right. Looks like everyone
got on as smoothly as planned.

Let's get through that desert, everyone!

Onward toward the northwest!

Hey, hey, hey, hey...

Something's wrong.

I still can't shake the feeling
that someone's watching us.

Kakyoin, I think you're worrying a bit too much.

The palm leaves are covering our tracks.

And we can see a great distance around us.

If someone were here, we'd know.

Actually, I can't help but feel a presence, too.

Jotaro, look into it.

Do you see anything suspicious?

No, I don't. There's nothing. But...

Something's weird. Something is...

Hey, let's hurry up and go.

Indeed.

Let's get as far as we can,

and once the sun goes down,
we'll stop and put up our tents.

It's too dangerous to travel at night.

But, man, it's hot. Look, it's 50 degrees Celsius.

It is hot.

But it's always hottest around this time of day...

Eight o'clock? Wha?

Jotaro! What time does your clock say?

Ten after eight...

Hey, Old Man!

So, it is...

I-I know we lost track of time,

b-but what's going on?

It's past 8 PM...

So why isn't the sun going down?

I-Impossible!

The thermometer just jumped
to 60 degrees Celsius!

N-Not only is it not going down...

...but it's actually rising
higher and higher in the west!

Could that sun be...

...a Stand?!

The Sun

Arabia Fats

I-I can't believe this!

We're in the middle of the desert!

Try to hide behind some rocks!

That sun is a Stand?!

We were careless. I didn't realize...

I felt like we were being watched,
but couldn't see it at all...

At this rate, all day long... No, all night long...

That Stand is planning

to boil us overnight, like octopuses,

and kill us!

No. It won't take that long.

It's dangerous to even be in a
sauna for more than thirty minutes.

How can we fight it?

Damn it! It's now 70 degrees Celsius!

Not to mention, we can't even tell
if that Stand is close or far away!

The distance is impossible to judge!

The quickest way to settle
this is to take out the user.

Yes, the user... Whoever it is should be nearby.

We must find them.

They've been concealing their
presence from us somehow while

following us all this way.

Hold it!

What if it's like The Lovers

that we encountered in Pakistan,
a Stand that can be remotely controlled?

That's inconceivable.

A weak Stand can be controlled from a distance,

but I'm sure you can feel The Sun's energy...

The user must be nearby.

This isn't good...

The camels are collapsing from the heat.

But just staying still won't help us!

I'll use Hierophant to look around.

Kakyoin!

I'll just find out the enemy Stand's location.

If we know how far away it actually is,

we might be able to find the user.

Twenty meters. Forty meters...

Sixty meters. Eighty meters...

One hundred...

Something's not right!

Kakyoin! Call Hierophant back!

Something's coming at us!

Before that happens, Emerald...

Kakyoin!

The camel!

You bastard!

I'm busting a hole in the ground, so get in!

Are you all right, Kakyoin?

Yes. I was in the middle of using Emerald Splash.

That guarded me, so I'm not badly hurt.

B-But more importantly, it's hot...

I feel like I'm going to go crazy.

That attack was perfectly aimed.

That means the enemy is definitely watching us.

Where are they?! Where's the enemy?

Don't talk so loud.

The enemy will find us!

Calm down. Let's just sit
tight and see what happens.

Oh, shit!

Things can't go on like this...

Think!

This is the time for an
old-timer like me to shine!

But we're in a bad spot.

I can't even use my best technique.

I have to get some information...

Jotaro!

Son of a bitch!

Where the hell are you?!

How are you watching us?

Is the enemy invisible or something?!

Hey, Kakyoin, what's wrong?

Hey, Kakyoin!

What are you laughing about?

A-Are you all right, Kakyoin?!

Get a grip, man!

J-Jotaro? You, too?!

Y-You, too, Polnareff?!

Oh, my God!

E-Everyone's finally lost it because of the heat.

I'm the only one left who's sane.

Hey! Jotaro, calm down!
Get a hold of yourself!

The best way to win when the
going gets rough is to stay calm!

Wha?!

Don't get the wrong idea, Mr. Joestar...

Look at that rock over there.

Isn't it just big enough for someone to hide behind?

What do you mean?

Now look at the rock on the opposite side.

On the opposite side?

You still don't see it?

There's a rock that's shaped exactly the same

on the opposite side.

The shadow is also reversed. Which means...

It's so stupid!

Move.

Out of my way, Old Man.

Jotaro! If you go outside right now,

you're all but asking to be attacked!

It's dangerous!

A hole appeared in the air?!

Good grief. You're pathetic, Old Man.

I'll just assume that the heat's too much for you.

Otherwise, it's hard to
believe you're my grandfather.

We've defeated the enemy Stand,
so it's night now.

Or should I say it's back to being night?

Either way, we're safe.

How long do you plan to stay in that hole?

R-Right...

Good grief. It's finally dark.

It's a mirror!

Take a look.

Check out the machines behind this mirror.

It's pretty comfortable.
It even has air conditioning.

Man, I didn't realize that
he was reflecting the desert

landscape and tailing us from behind.

He has a tank of water.

We'll gladly take that.

Hey, a drink.

Huh?

Wait, this means... we beat him already?

It's done?

We don't even know this guy's name,

but we've already beaten his Stand, The Sun?

That would be what it means.

The Sun

The Sun                         Retires

The Sun card's Stand, huh?

It was quite the opponent,

but once you figure it out, it's pretty stupid.

Let's hurry to our next destination.

It's quite chilly in the desert at night, isn't it?

W-Wait! Traveling at night is dangerous!

Now we might get lost!

We've defeated our enemy,

so we can have sweet dreams tonight.

Ba-dum-tss.

So noisy...

What is this place?

It's an amusement park!

I've never been here before.

Wh-What am I doing lounging
around on a ferris wheel?

Something's wrong.

I'm sure we were traveling through
the Saudi Arabian desert by camel...

But everyone's gone.

Am I by myself?

Still, something's strange.

There are no children in this amusement park,

but I keep hearing a baby crying.

I wonder where it is...

Menacing

Th-This card is...

Death 13!

The card is moving!

Kakyoin! Kakyoin!

Come on, give me a break!

Stop freaking out and shaking
the bed like you're in The Exorcist.

You scared me to death.

Where are we?

Don't ask dumb questions.

Come on, get up already.

Once we eat, we're flying outta here.

Today looks like another hot one.

I had a terrifying dream.

It was truly terrifying.

Ooh, what did you dream about?

Let's hear it!

Well, I can't remember. I've forgotten it all.

What?

Anyway, it was terrifying.

You saved me when you woke me up.

Man, don't say weird stuff like that.

We're leaving. Hurry up and get ready.

My hand is cut.

When did that happen?

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

Episode 19: Death 13, Part 1

Jotaro and Mr. Joestar have
already headed to the plane.

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

We're gonna travel 500 kilometers today.

My dog!

My dog... is dead!

Who would do such a thing?!

A dog...?

A dog...

I could have sworn I saw a dead dog not long ago...

It's awful, but it has nothing to do with us.

Let's go.

Hey, hey, hey, hey...

Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hold on a sec, Mister.

Whaddya mean you can't sell us the plane now?

You said last night you'd sell it,
and even took my money.

I'll return your money.

You see, the baby's sick. It's a 39°C fever.

Huh?

There's no doctor in this town, so we
have to take the baby somewhere else.

Th-Then how about the plane over there?

That one's broken.

The others are out and
won't be back any time soon.

What's up? Some kind of argument?

Yeah.

A baby...

A baby, a baby...

I seem to recall hearing a baby cry...

But I can't remember where...

The plane will be back tomorrow night.

I can sell it to you after that.

Tomorrow night?

Someone's life is on the line for us, too.

We can't afford to spend two days lollygagging.

Then are you going to let that baby die?

Well...

Um, how about this?

Let's leave the baby with these gentlemen,

who can visit the doctor on their way.

Uh, but that's...

The Cessna only carries four.

But there's room enough for a baby.

I could swear I just saw it smile...

And it already has teeth...?

You sure, lady? You wanna
leave the baby with these guys?

H-Hold it. That's also a problem!

It's dangerous for a baby to come with us.

I said this would be dangerous...

Don't worry, Mr. Joestar.

No one would send their
Stand after us in the air...

We even made sure the
plane itself wasn't a Stand.

I'm more worried about the Old
Man's flying than enemy Stands.

Oh, thank goodness. What a relief.

By the way... I wonder whose baby that was.

You're not its mother?

I found it by the well this morning.

But somehow, that baby's voice made me dizzy,

and made me think it needed to be on that plane.

Wha...

I always get so tired when I get on a plane...

Sorry, Mr. Joestar, but I'm
gonna nap for about 30 minutes.

Sure.

The hell is this?!

K-Kakyoin, what is this place?!

Where's Mr. Joestar? And Jotaro?!

Bam

The dream I had this morning is continuing.

We're inside the dream!

What? A dream?

Yes.

Oh! So this is just a dream.

What a relief. A dead dog
isn't scary if it's just a dream.

Polnareff, what are you saying?

Dreams are only scary
because you think they're scary.

Come on, relax.

You're wrong! How could we
both have the same dream?!

You've got a point. It's kinda weird,

but that could happen in a dream.

Whoa! How did this happen?

This is both convenient and lucky!

See? If you think they're fun,
dreams become fun.

Listen! You saw this dog's
corpse this morning, didn't you?

This dog must have had the same dream I did.

It was killed in the dream!

That's also when my hand was cut.

By who?

The enemy's Stand, Death 13!

The enemy's Stand?

Yes.

Oh, you had a dream about Stands?

Come on, relax already.

No! It wasn't a dream about Stands.

A Stand was in my dream!

Right. So this is a dream, yeah?

You're so dense!

Lali-ho! Talk about a big idiot!

For pity's sake...

I'm saying that you're slow, Polnareff!

I-It's coming from the dog's wound...

Lali-ho! You're in the Death
God's world of dreams, Polnareff!

A megaphone...?

Wh-What the hell is that?

Polnareff, get ready to battle! That's Death 13!

W-Wor—

Come forth, Hierophant Green!

Come out, Hierophant!

Chario—

Hierophant isn't coming out!
I can't summon him!

Chariot isn't coming out!

Is it because we're inside a dream...?

Lali-ho! Don't you think it's romantic,
being able to die in a dream?

Lali-ho!

Death 13

J-Jotaro, do you feel that?

Yeah. I feel it.

Are you stupid?

You know that only a Stand
can defeat a Stand, don't you?

It's time for your eternal sleep, Polnareff.

Lali-ho...

Polnareff!

Die!

Polnareff.

Wake up, Polnareff.

Polnareff, the baby's wet himself.

Change his diaper.

Curses! Someone must have woken him up.

He's quite lucky.

Lali-ho. Well, that's fine.

As soon as he wakes up,
his memory of this is gone.

I'll just have to get him
when he falls asleep again.

Then, Kakyoin, I guess you're first.

Lali-ho!

Hey, are you awake, Polnareff?

The diaper! Change the diaper!

All right...

I feel like I had a terrifying dream...

But I don't remember what
happened in it. I've forgotten...

Once you've changed his diaper,

you can go finish that dream.

I won't wake you up again.

H-Hold on a second!

This kid's crapped his diaper!

Look! Just look at this!

Well, he's a baby.
That's why he wears diapers.

Seriously?! You're serious about this?!

I had no idea! What a vile creature...

Man, it's all over the place...

Stop yapping and change it already.

It stinks.

Aren't you embarrassed?
Hurry up and become an adult.

Does this work?

Well, I say it's good.
Jotaro, hold on to the edge there.

I'm going to pin it.

Right. Like this?

Hey, hold on to the baby.

Lali-ho!

Stop! Stop it!

What's the matter, Kakyoin?

Hey!

What's going on?

Stop! Stop! Stop it!

Crap!

I can't control it!

Hey, are we going to crash?

Stop!

Kakyoin, what the hell is wrong?

He was like that this morning, too!

Whatever, just calm him down.

Old man, hurry up and regain control!

We're going to crash!

Hey, Kakyoin, calm down.

We're about to crash because of you.

Lali-ho.

Talk about a rough sleeper.
You're gonna kill my user at this rate.

Y-Your user is that baby?

I-I can't believe it...

He's only about six months old...

Eleven months. Eleven months!

I'm a genius. A genius!

I may crap in my diapers, but I
know a lot more than you guys.

Lali-ho!

Now you won't be able to scream anymore.

A Stand within a dream...

I have to let Mr. Joestar and
Jotaro know of this somehow...

What are you doing?

Hurry up and level us out.

Stop fussing! I'm a man who doesn't know panic.

I'm working on that right now!

I'm not waking up...

Lali-ho. Looks like no one's going
to notice if you're cutting your arm

with a knife that's smaller than my wee-wee.

Besides, you can hurt yourself all you want
in a dream, but it won't wake you up.

As long as you're asleep,
I control your mental energy.

Death 13 is a Stand that enters
the unguarded mental state of sleep.

Damn it. Stop!

What's wrong, old man?

We're crashing!

I'll control it with Hermit Purple!

I did it!

I got control back just in time!

A close one...

Looks like we managed to avoid crashing.

Those guys are dangerous.

Now then... how about I kill you
by crushing that heart of yours?

Then Joestar and the others will just
think that you had a heart attack.

Die! Kakyoin!

Did you all see that?! How do
you like my flying now, huh?!

Hey.

Smash

Wh-Why is there a palm tree out here?!

Good grief... So...

This is actually happening?

Abu Dhabi

Crash
Cairo

Crash

Crash         Site

Is this enough?

Yeah, thanks.

We survived, but...

Kakyoin, what's going on?

This is all your fault.

I don't know...

I feel like I might have had a terrifying dream.

When I woke up, I was dead tired.

Is there something wrong with me?

Cheer up. I'm sure you're just too tired.

It's been about a month since we left Japan,

and the enemy's been
attacking nonstop ever since.

Hey. Looks like the baby's fever's gone down.

Thank goodness he's safe.

If we lost him, I don't know what we'd do.

Peek-a-boo!

Peek-a-boo!

Such a cute smile!

What's so funny about that?
It's not even a joke or anything.

What an idiot.

Shut it. I'm getting tired of humoring this guy, too.

Hey, Old Man. The radio's not busted.

What should we do?
Should we send out an SOS?

That'll mean DIO can find us, but...

It can't be helped. Let's call for rescue.

We'll do it for the baby.

I thought something hurt...
There's blood again.

Did I cut it when we crashed?

Bam

What? The cuts form letters.

Baby... Stand?

That's what it says...

Wh-What does that mean?
It's my handwriting.

I can't remember...

Did I do this to myself?

There isn't any blood on my knife,

but it seems it was done with this blade.

Did I forget something really important?

Damn it. I heard they were clever...

But he actually carved letters

into his arm while cutting himself...

What was that look in the baby's eyes?

And as soon as our eyes met,
he consciously looked away.

Baby...

Stand...?

Baby... Stand.

Did something really happen to my mind?

I'm starting to think...

that this baby is really a Stand user!

Hey, Kakyoin! What are you doing?

Come on, that's too rough.

You could strangle him doing that.
What's wrong with you?

M-My apologies...

There, there, it's all right.

Let's get something to eat.

I'm sure you'll calm down once you eat.

Hey, Jotaro. It looks like
Kakyoin's really losing it.

There, there, everything's okay.

I wonder if he's gonna make it through this trip.

What do you think about Kakyoin?

Did you see that?!

Kakyoin, that's enough. Stop that.

How foolish are you?

He's a Stand user!

Did you cut that into your arm yourself?

Do they misunderstand even more?

Lali-ho!

Episode 20: Death 13, Part 2

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

Saudi Arabia,

approximately 8,800 kilometers from Japan.

It's been around four weeks since we left.

If we don't hurry, there'll be serious trouble.

Kakyoin...

Hey, Jotaro.

What do you think is up with Kakyoin?

He was flailing around in his sleep on
the plane, and now he looks like this.

He even went after the baby.

Something's wrong with him.
I think he's at his wit's end.

I don't know if he can continue this journey.

I panicked back there, thinking
Kakyoin had figured out who I am...

But now, Kakyoin's half-doubting himself.

And we're in the middle of the desert.

Now, I just have to wait
until they're all asleep.

If there's no one to wake them up...

That smells great. What are you making?

Baby food.

This is milk, egg yolks, bananas,
and bread all stewed together.

Here. Want a taste?

It's good!

I could totally go for this!
Give me more! More!

Hey, now. There won't
be any left for the baby.

You bastard! Don't eat my food!

I'm hungry! Hurry up and feed me!

A—

A scorpion!

Th-This isn't good!

That was close...

C-Crap!

Kakyoin was watching.

He killed the scorpion.

Th-That baby really is...

Sh-Shit!

That's all you get.

Mr. Joestar, Polnareff, did you see that?!

Huh?

That baby isn't normal after all!

He just killed a scorpion!

In the blink of an eye!
He stabbed it with a safety pin!

Kakyoin, hold on.
What are you talking about?

That is not a normal baby!

He's not even a year old,
but knew what a scorpion was...

And he killed it with those tiny hands!

A scorpion?

Where?!

In here!

The dead scorpion on the pin should be in here.

I-It's not here...

B-But it's true!

Where'd you hide it?!

Is it in your clothes?!

We got it, Kakyoin! That's enough! Stop!

Mr. Joestar!

I said this earlier, but you're tired.

Let's talk again tomorrow morning,
after you've calmed down.

Okay, open wiiide! It's dewicious!

Oh? That's strange. I'm sure you're
hungry, but you don't want any?

Say "ah."

S-Stop it!

There's a reason I can't eat right now!

Mr. Joestar! I'm sure of it now!

I don't know where he hid the scorpion,
but he's a Stand user!

And I have the very thing to prove that!

Look at the wound on my arm!
At what it says!

This is a warning.

This must be a wound I got in my sleep.

Oh, my God!

Kakyoin, did you do that to yourself?

Eh?

K-Kakyoin, you've finally...

Oh, my God!

That big idiot!

Didn't you realize that if you showed
them that, they'd think you were a fool?!

D-Did they misunderstand me even more?

A-At this rate... I have no other choice.

I'll have to use force!

Hierophant Green!

Bam

It's no use. He's totally lost his mind.

I-Impossible. I-I'm certain, Jotaro...

His Stand was the one in our dreams, Polnareff.

We can't fall asleep, Mr. Joestar.

Please, believe me. Everyone...
If we fall asleep, we'll be killed.

Please, believe me. Believe in me...

Yes! I got away without being found out!

You guys lose!

You lost to your own disbelief in your friend!

It's my victory, you fools!

I can't believe it...

So Kakyoin can't fight or travel with us anymore?

We'll figure out what to
do with him in the morning.

Let's go to bed.

Polnareff, help me move Kakyoin.

Sure thing.

Jotaro, bring the sleeping bags.

Yeah.

Did you say something?

Not really. He's just heavy.

Now I can slice you all up and scatter
your remains all over the desert!

I see.

Why are we in sleeping bags at an
amusement park, like a bunch of idiots?

That's right!

Th-This is...

Jotaro! Mr. Joestar! Be careful!

I-I remember now.

W-We're inside a dream.

It's terrifying!

This is a world of nightmares!

Oh, so it's just a dream.
Then I'm just gonna relax.

Don't have the same reaction I did!

Listen! What Kakyoin was saying is true!

Baby. Stand.

We're in enemy territory.

I know it's hard to believe,
but the Stand user is that baby!

There's no one to wake you up now.

So there's absolutely no way
for you to escape Death 13's world.

Now I'll finally finish you all.

Since I made Kakyoin pass out,

he should already be somewhere in this world.

We have to find him!

Where are you, Kakyoin?

I have to apologize to him.

P-Polnareff, what's with your hairstyle?

Did you mess up styling it?

Eh?

Polnareff!

Curl

What?

M-My...

My artificial hand!

Pop!

Holy shit!

How are we supposed to fight this?

How?!

A-Anything can happen here.

There are no rules or logic.

It's a world where we're at his mercy!

Wait. There was just one rule.

The thing that'll

slice us into little pieces

is his Stand,

and his Stand alone!

Lali-ho!

Death 13

Manishu Booi

Lali-ho!

Star...

It's no use, Jotaro!

We can't bring our Stands into the dream world!

...Platinum!

Rumble

Th-That's odd... His Stand appeared.

Clank

Lali-ho! I'm a fake!

Loom...

This overwhelming power! This absolute fear!

It's so much fun!

A Stand is spiritual energy.

And dreams are the spirit unguarded!

Death 13 has surrounded that unguarded spirit,

and that's why you can't summon your Stands!

Although...

Whoosh

If you had

summoned your Stands before you fell asleep,

you could have brought them with you,
like the clothes you're wearing,

the sleeping bags, and the artificial hand.

Death 13 will never have to face another Stand!

And the only thing that can
defeat a Stand is another Stand,

so I'll always win!

Now...

How about you give me a scream?

One that symbolizes how happy and
refreshed I feel at my easy victory!

Lali-...ho?

Lali-ho!

Oh, it's just the fake one I made.

Wh-What?!

Impossible!

This one's not a fake!

Crush

This is the real Hierophant!

It's back!

It's Kakyoin!

Kakyoin's right there!

Bam!

When I lost consciousness earlier,

did you forget that I had Hierophant out?

I had Hierophant hide underground
before I fell asleep.

Squish

Help me!

Now, it's time for your punishment, baby.

D-Damn it!

Let go!

Stop, Death 13!

He's completely in your blind spot.

If you keep resisting...

Even if you're just a baby,
your neck will be broken.

Kakyoin!

Kakyoin. We owe you an apology.

I thought you might have become weak-minded.

I couldn't believe in you.

You were fighting this battle alone...

I'm sorry.

No, Polnareff. It couldn't be helped.

I only figured out a way to bring my Stand

with me into the dream after you hit me.

So in a way, this is all thanks to you.

R-Really?

I-I can't help but feel a bit conflicted.

I'm kind of ashamed...

He's holding back because I'm a baby...

Kakyoin, your naiveté will cost your life!

You're still inside my nightmare world!

Hey, what's with the clouds?

The clouds... are moving strangely,

and coming closer!

Don't try anything funny,

Death 13!

Kakyoin! Get Hierophant away from his back!

What?

I'll chop you in half!

I-Impossible!

He chopped himself...

in h-half.

Kakyoin!

Lali-ho!

Didn't you realize it?

Death 13's body is actually hollow!

Death 13 is just the head,
arms, and the giant scythe.

You enormous fools!

Let's see.

Kakyoin's body should also be
split in two inside the sleeping bag.

Just kidding!

Kakyoin!

Y-You're all right?

Please look closer.

My Hierophant isn't so careless
as to stay on his back forever.

He's not chopped in half!

He's taken on a string-like form...

And he's crawling into my ear!

M-My arm is moving on its own...

It's coming in...

Bam

I told you!

He was in your blind spot,

so your scythe couldn't touch him.

Now, if you don't wish to
be destroyed from within...

How about you heal this wound on my arm?

Anything can happen in dreams,

so I'm sure you can heal a cut, right?

R-Right...

All right, everyone. Wake up!

Polnareff, wake up! Breakfast is ready!

I feel like I had a terrible dream...

Same here.

I can't remember it,
but I still feel like it was terrifying.

Kakyoin!

A-Are you all right?

What do you mean?

Wh-What do I...

You were totally deranged last night!

You even carved letters into your arm...

H-Huh?

The wound is gone?

Now, I'll just go change the baby's diaper.

Huh?

Come on, it's morning.

He seems to be getting along with the baby,

so maybe I was just dreaming...

So... Did you sleep well?

Oh, well!

Everyone has forgotten.

A Stand whose existence is completely forgotten...

What a unique Stand.

But I remember.

I'm the only one who brought
a Stand into the dream.

Listen. Because you're a baby,

I won't mortally wound you,
or injure you at all.

We'll take you to a nearby town.

You need to go back to your mother.

But don't ever come near us again.

If you do, I'll punish you.

Just like this...

My poop?

Oh, Kakyoin.

You even made some baby food?

I did.

Let's see. I'm sure you must be hungry by now.

Hey, no... You wouldn't...

Come on, it's dewicious! Open wiiide!

Oh, this again? I wonder what
he's got against this stuff....

At this rate, I'll have to force-feed him.

Stop!

Hey, Mr. Joestar.

If you force him, he'll just hate it more.

In cases like this...

Coochie-coochie-coo... Coochie-coochie-coo...

Coochie-coochie-coochie-coochie-coo...

See? Isn't it delicious?

Ba-dum-tss.

Joestar and the others have now
crossed the Arabian Peninsula,

and are currently crossing the
Red Sea, about to enter Egypt.

But!

Hey, old man. Something's not right.

You're going the wrong way.

Shouldn't you be heading directly west, to Egypt?

You seem to be heading toward that island.

Yeah, that's right. I have my
reasons for not telling you before,

but before we enter Egypt, we need to
make a slight detour and meet someone.

He's a man who's extremely
important to this journey.

An important man...?

I'm the one who let Avdol die.

There's no way I can make up for that.

To thank you for freeing me from the lamp...

It's an actual treasure!

...I'll grant you three wishes!

Can you bring someone back to life?

You seem to be heading toward that island.

Before we enter Egypt, we need to
make a slight detour and meet someone.

He's a man who's extremely

An important man...?

Hey, now. Does someone actually live here?

It's such a tiny little island,
and it looks deserted.

Indeed. Mr. Joestar, does he really live here?

He lives here by himself.

That's what he told me back in India.

Eh? Who do you mean by "he"?

What? Indian curry?

Episode 21: Judgment, Part 1

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

Hey. Someone's watching us
from the grass over there.

What?

He's running away!

From the back, he looks...

Yeah. That's definitely familiar!

Hold it! Please wait!

Come, now. Are you hungry, Michael? Prince?

I kept the nutritional balance in mind
and mixed in the shells you love, too.

There's more over here.

Get nice and fat so you'll
be a tasty chicken, Lionel.

That man... He can't be...

It can't be...

Hold it!

I'll go talk to him. All of you, wait here.

My name is Joseph Joestar.

I'm traveling to Egypt with these three—

Go away! I won't hear it!

That voice...

D-Don't talk to me!

No one comes to see me with good news!

It's only when something bad happens!
I don't want to hear it!

Go away!

Mr. Avdol!

Avdol...

Go away!

I-It can't be!

That's Avdol's...

father.

His father?

He left the world behind,
and lives alone on this island.

I didn't tell any of you about this

because if DIO were to find
out that we had stopped here,

the peace Avdol's father
enjoys here could be compromised.

I didn't want to let that happen.

But telling him about his son Avdol's death

won't be easy to do...

Polnareff!

Avdol's death was not your fault.

No, it's my responsibility.

I have to carry that.

Is his father a Stand user, as well?

Yes, but I don't know what sort of Stand it is.

Given how his father has treated us,

it's hard to imagine he'll help us.

Leave this all to me.

I'll try talking to his father.

Even if it was to avenge my sister's death,

I'm still the one who let Avdol die.

I'm sure there's nothing I can
do to make it up to his father...

How depressing.

This is pretty shiny.

I wonder if it drifted up from some sunken ship...

It's got barnacles all over it.

Looks like it's made of gold, but...

There's some creepy face carved into it.

But it looks valuable.

I'll try to rub these barnacles off.

Wh-What the?!

Kaboom

I-It's gone!

Wh-What was that just now?

Did the air trapped inside
burst out all of a sudden?

It's not Aladdin's magic lamp or anything...

That scared me to death.

Three!

You get three!

I'll grant your wishes.

Tell me three things you desire.

Wh-What the hell is this?!

My name is Cameo.

I want to thank you for
freeing me from the lamp.

So tell me your three wishes.

Are you a new Stand user?!

Silver Chariot!

H-He's pretty good.

He's got incredible power...

Hey! Judging from your power,
your user must be close by!

Who is it?!

Is the answer to that question your first wish?

Are you sure you want to
make a boring wish like that?

Don't "I'll grant you three wishes" me!

Are you saying you could make me
a super rich man right now?

Huh?!

Is that your first wish?

Just try it if you can!
Stop messing with me, damn it!

Very well. I'll grant that wish.

Hail 2 U!

(Fortune be with you!)

Wha...

What the hell was that?

It wasn't the enemy's Stand?

What a strange guy.

He didn't attack me, but
told me to make three wishes.

I don't know what's going on,
but I've got to be cautious.

Something's on this island.

I'll have to tell Mr. Joestar
about what just happened.

It could have something to do
with Avdol's father, as well.

What's that?

I hear a really loud metallic sound...

Th-This is... It can't be!

Th-This is gold from the Napoleonic era.

It's not an illusion, or a dream.

It's the real thing.
It's a real treasure of gold!

A-Are you mocking me?!

No... If he were mocking me,
when did he bury this here?

He didn't have time to bury
this after I made my wish.

How'd he bring this here?

Tell me your second wish.

I shall grant it for you.

Y-You bastard! What are you plotting,
doing something like this?!

Like I'd fall for your trap!

If you're my enemy, act like it, and fight me!

Or I'm going to take this treasure.

Is the answer to that
question your second wish?

Are you sure you want to
make a boring wish like that?

To thank you for letting me out of
that lamp, I will grant you any wish.

Y-You bastard!

All right... Then, make me...

A manga artist!

That was my dream as a kid!

I want to be bigger than Disney!

Don't make me some pathetic sap.

I'm going to build Polnareffland!

W-Wait, hold on.

Hold on just a second.

Wait, just wait...

Actually, I want a girlfriend!

More than wealth and fame...

I want love!

Someone who's really cute,

and a relationship like we're
bound by the red string of fate...

I want to meet a girl who feels the way I do!

If you can do that, do it right now, damn it!

A girl, eh? Very well.

N-No, wait. Actually, hold on a sec.

Can you...

bring someone back...

from the dead?

Is the answer to that
question your second wi—

Oh, stop that already!

Bring my dead sister back to life!

Bring my friend, Avdol, back to life!

You can't do that, can you?!

Very well.

I'll grant that wish.

Wh-What?!

Silver Chariot

Jean Pierre Polnareff

You said... you can grant that?

Indeed. But you made two wishes there,

so I'll grant them one at a time.

I'll start with your second wish, your sister.

Hail 2 U!

H-Hold it! Who the hell are you?!

Why would you—

Wh-What was that sound?

That sound I just heard...

I-It sounded like the ground was being dug up...

I hear the digging again!

Wh-What is that sound?!

I-It can't be!

A-A woman crying?

Who the hell is there?!

Th-This is...

H-Hair...

A woman's hair.

A woman's footsteps...

I-Impossible!

It can't be... It can't be true...

My little sister is buried back at home in France...

Who the hell are you?

Just who the hell are you?!

Don't... come near me...

I'm in pain...

My body's not complete yet...

That voice...

Sherry!

Where did Polnareff go?

He's not here, either.

It's gotten rather dark.
Where could he have gone?

He couldn't have run into the enemy, could he?

Sh-Sherry...

Is that you?

It is you, isn't it?

Wh-Where are you going?

Where are you going, Sherry?!

It's me! Please wait!

Why are you running away, Sherry?!

Where are you? Please, let me see you!

Please wait, Sherry!

Let me see your face... Just one more time...

Brother!

Brother! Raise me higher! Higher!

Yay! Now spin!

Oh, how lovely! I've been
wanting a new umbrella.

Thank you, Brother.

I'm off, now.

Sherry! Sherry!

What... is this dead bird?

It looks like it was bitten apart.

Sherry!

Are you there? Why are you running?

It's me, your older brother!

Because... I'm covered in dirt...

And my hair is all scraggly...

Don't worry about that, Sherry!

No matter how dirty, you're still you.

Why are you crying?

Why are you sad, Sherry?

Sherry...

No.

No, don't.

Don't come near me!

B-But why? What are you saying?

Because...

You'll hate me.

Hate you? Have I ever said that I hated you?

You have.

When we were kids...

When I gave your tropical fish to the cat...

You got really angry and said you hated me.

Yeah, I was angry then,
but I've always loved you!

Even now!

Really?

You've always loved me?

Of course I have!

You'll love me, no matter what I do?

I'll always love you, no matter what.

Sherry, you really are Sherry.

You don't know how much I've missed you.

I see.

I feel the same, Brother.

Sherry, please look this way.

Please show me your face.

Why are you crying? Why are you sad?

Sad?

No, Brother.

I'm not crying because I'm sad.

Huh? Then...

I'm...

happy...

because I can eat you, Brother!

Ch-Chariot!

Sher... ry...

I'm sorry that I bit you, Brother.

My body's not complete yet.

But if I eat your flesh,
Brother, I'll return to normal.

It's okay if I eat you, right?

You always did what I asked you to.

Cameo!

What is it?

Y-You bastard!

What? Do you have a complaint?

I granted your wish.

My only power is to grant wishes.
The rest is up to you.

Th-Then I'll tell you my third wish!

Make my sister...

Make my sister...

Make my sister disappear!
Return her to the earth!

Nooope!

What?!

You still don't get it, Polnareff?

I'm a Stand!

I'm the Stand that suggests the Judgment card!

My power is to grant the wishes people hold

deep in their hearts, giving them form from dirt.

You made your own sister,
from your own heart!

Y-You...

Anything you've created, I cannot unmake.

I win this battle!

Bam

By the way...

You said something about a third wish,

but you've already made
your third wish, haven't you?

You—

You don't mean...

dying because your sister ate you.

Both of you... Return to the ground, please!

Why? You're the one who brought us back.

It's your turn to enter the ground!

I-I was so freaked out that
I forgot to summon Chariot.

I was so caught up in my wish
that I forgot to use my Stand...

Get away from me, please!

Get away from me!

What?!

"Please"? Nope! You don't have any wishes left.

I've already granted your three wishes.

You don't get any more.

Stop!

Hail 2 U!

Make sure you cry and scream
all you can before you die.

You're in this island's backwoods.

Your voice won't reach the shore.
No one will come to save you.

I-It's no use. I'm done for...

I'm going to die. I'm beaten.

Sherry...

Avdol...

Even though they're just clay dolls,
it's not so bad being defeated by them.

Avdol, just like you said, you died because of me.

I have no complaints about
whatever happens to me.

What...?

Are my eyes so blurry that I'm seeing double?

It looks like there are two Avdols.

Of course there's only one clay doll.

If I'm seeing things, I guess that
means death is really close now.

Not to mention how much I'm bleeding...

It makes sense that I'd hallucinate.

Then... I guess I'll die.

I'll have to tap out early.

Goodbye, Mr. Joestar, Kakyoin, Jotaro...

I pray for your victory.

Avdol, for you...

I'll atone in the next world...

What?! Impossible!

I knew it! There is another Avdol!

My eyes weren't playing tricks!

Besides the clay doll Avdol...

There's another Avdol!

Magician's Red!

Impossible! He should have been dead!

He was stabbed by the Hanged Man, Centerfold!

He should be dead...

Tsk, tsk.

Mohammed Avdol!

Yes, I am!

Bam

I-Is it really you?

Tsk, tsk.

Rumble

Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

I-Is it the real you?

Polnareff, you haven't matured a bit.

You're still going on

about your sister without
thinking of the consequences.

Impossible!

There's no way you can be alive!

I was told that after you were stabbed in the back,

Hol Horse blew your brains out,
and you died on the spot.

Indeed, I was shot. Right in the forehead...

But because I was stabbed
in the back, for a moment,

my face was looking up.

Meaning, the bullet grazed me.

I guess this is what you call a blessing in disguise.

Hol Horse's bullet only scratched my skin and skull,

so it never reached my brain,
and wasn't a mortal wound.

But I did completely lose consciousness.

Cameo of the Judgment card, was it?

I'll give you Hell!

Hell 2 U!

The third wish... Just the third wish...

It's real.

It came true.

Judgment

Cameo

Mohammed Avdol is alive.

This bad news...

Shouldn't you hurry and tell DIO and your
other Stand user buddies about it?

Shouldn't you, Cameo?

That's right! I have to tell them!
I have to let them know!

Mr. Joestar, Kakyoin, and Jotaro!

This is, indeed, very surprising news.

But I can turn that news into this:

Judgement's Cameo not only
killed the idiot Polnareff,

but also killed Avdol,
who was actually still alive!

Oh! I shall change it into good news!

Magician's Red!

Whoa, there.

Avdol!

This Stand is rather powerful...

Be careful! It's not just power.
He's got speed, too.

Avdol, is that all you've got?

It looks like I'll be able to
share my good news after all.

May fortune...

be with you both!

What?!

Hail 2 U!

Brother...

No. My Sherry...

Sherry... died.

You're...

just...

a clay doll!

Brother...

Polnareff.

My apologies. I take back my
statement that you hadn't matured.

No, you were right.

I should be the one to apologize.

This battle has been decided.

Avdol! Tell me your three wishes!
I shall grant them for you.

Before you die for real this time!

Go ahead! Give it a shot.

You get three wishes.

Bastard! He's making fools of us!

Avdol, ignore him.

You don't have to make any wishes.

Avdol, are you listening to me?

No...

Make it four.

Wha?!

What?

Wishes. I mean wishes!

I wish to make the three wishes into four.

Tsk, tsk.

You can't be serious...

Are you denying my wish?
Cameo, you're the one that offered!

I will have you keep your promise!

You still insist upon this futile contest of power?

Such a weak kick.

What?!

Yes! Awesome!

Tsk, tsk. My first wish was
to make you scream in pain.

It came true.

I-Impossible! You're strong!
You're much stronger than earlier!

The wound left after I was stabbed by the
Hanged Man hasn't completely healed yet.

I was guarding that wound earlier,

so I couldn't use all of my strength.

Wha—

I was finally able to stand again
just three days ago in India.

I was able to take a plane here,
so the trip was very easy.

Nothing less from you, Avdol!

Now, my second wish...

To make you scream in fear!
And my third wish...

To make you cry in regret!

Th-That bastard! He's running away!

Wait, damn you!

Shh. Be quiet, Polnareff.

With that kind of power and speed...

It is the rule of Stands that the
user must be somewhere nearby.

Is he here?

He should be hiding very close by.

Could that be—

Shh!

The user is hiding beneath the ground?!

Damn him! What should I do with him?

He had the nerve to use my sister,
so I'll show him Hell!

Hell 2 U!

Bastard!

Grind

I'm gonna drop all sorts of things in there...

Like dirt, sand...

A spider...

And ants...

And a match.

Bastard! I'm not done yet! Not yet! Not yet!

Hey, Polnareff.

I do believe nature is calling.

Shall we engage in the
timeless ritual of male bonding,

and take a piss together?

Tsk, tsk.

Huh?

I somehow made it.

C'mon! Laugh, Polnareff!

Laugh! Laugh, Polnareff!

Avdol... Did your personality change?

You weren't a guy who thought up
perverse stuff like this before.

It's not because you were shot in the head, is it?

Come now, aim for it!

Right!

Please forgive me!

My fourth wish. That is...

To not listen to your wishes.

Magician's Red won't forgive you.

Not happening.

Bam

Ba-dum-tss!

Magician's Red

Mohammed Avdol

Hey! You'll never believe this, guys!

Who do you think I met?

Polnareff! We were worried about you!

Where did you get those wounds?

Were you attacked?

Who cares about my wounds?

Listen! Don't be shocked, Jotaro!

Don't let your back go out in shock, Kakyoin.

Who do you think I met, Mr. Joestar?

Behold and rejoice!

Tum-ta-da-da!

Here he is!

That bastard Avdol was alive!

Doo-do-doo!

Well, let's go.

I'll help you carry your luggage.

Hey, Avdol.

It's been a while. How are you?

Avdol, is that wound on your back all right?

It's fine. A bit stiff, though.

Hey...

Has it really been two weeks?

Thank goodness we're all still okay.

Hey...

Jotaro, you still wear all that stuff?
Don't you get hot?

W-Wait a minute, you guys!

Hey! I said wait, you assholes!

Hey, what's the deal with that attitude?!

A guy who was dead came back to life!

What the hell?! Why are you
having normal conversations?!

Oh, Polnareff, I'm sorry.
When I said I buried Avdol in India...

That was a lie.

Casual

Wh— Wh— What?!

It was Mr. Joestar and Jotaro who tended
the wounds on my head and back in India.

Y-You assholes knew that Avdol was still
alive in India, and you didn't tell me?!

You, too, Kakyoin?!

I only found out the day after.

But we couldn't let the enemy know.

And since you have such a big mouth...

Pardon. Since you can't lie,

I suggested that we keep it a secret from you.

If you'd let the secret slip,
Avdol couldn't have recovered in peace.

We were planning to tell you
as soon as we knew he was safe,

but we had no idea you'd run into him first.

Oh, yeah, Avdol!

Your dad is on this island!

Let's let him know you're here!

Oh, that was me in disguise.

Wh-What?!

Th-Then you guys... That was all...

Go away!

No one comes to see me with good news!

I don't want to hear it!

Avdol's death was not your fault.

Did you have to go that far?!

How dare you guys leave me out like that?!

Hey, now. There's no reason to cry.

I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd be this hurt.

I'm sorry, Polnareff.

There's a reason I came to this island in disguise.

A reason?

It was partially so the enemy wouldn't find out,

but I also had Avdol do a little shopping for me.

A little shopping?

It was a very conspicuous purchase.

So I disguised myself as a
rich Arab when I bought it.

Now, everyone, we're gonna ride that and leave!

Polnareff, cheer up already. Come on.

It's almost here!

Wait, what's almost here?

There's nothing—

What?!

A submarine?!

That's right. From here, we'll ride to Egypt in this!

Y-You're kidding! You really
bought something like this?!

Next Episode Preview

How about this glistening design?

A submarine, huh...

Perhaps a refreshing white would be best.

Hurry up and make some coffee.

I just don't know which one to pick.

Kakyoin, why are you taking that cup?

Hello? Oh, is that you, Joseph?

That bastard Avdol was alive!

Doo-do-doo!

It was Mr. Joestar and Jotaro who tended
the wounds on my head and back in India.

I also had Avdol do a little shopping for me.

From here, we'll ride to Egypt in this!

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
Stardust Crusaders

Episode 23: The High Priestess, Part 1

The Red Sea.

Divers all agree:

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

it is the most beautiful sea in the world.

The east and west shores are both red deserts,

Egypt
Sudan
Saudi Arabia

which is why it's known as the Red Sea.

There are no cities nearby to pollute it,

nor rivers that flow into it.

It is an unsullied sea.

Hey, can you drive this thing, Avdol?

Tsk, tsk. No problem.

I can drive it, too!

You're not driving this thing.

I'm not letting you crash us again.

Hmph. My grandson is so harsh.

A submarine, huh...

This is my first time in one,

but it's not as cramped as I expected.

Yeah. This is a vessel that the rich use
to explore the sea floor for pleasure.

As you see, it even has windows.

Oooh! Nice!

Whoa.

I've always kind of liked this sort of thing.

I wish I could've ridden it with a cute girl...

I see you haven't changed, Polnareff.

We didn't come here to play.

What's that?

It's a sonar.

It uses reflected sound waves

to detect things underwater, a bit like radar.

Wow...

All clear. Nothing is coming toward us.

With this, we can detect anyone trying
to attack us, from any direction.

But if we were to be attacked in here,
we'd have nowhere to run.

We are 60 meters below sea level, after all.

Wow... I guess this is to be expected
of pleasure cruiser for the wealthy.

A refrigerator, coffee maker...

Not to mention the latest satellite phones.

Wow!

Get me a drink, Kakyoin.

I'm parched.

I'd like one, too.

All right.

Is cola okay?

Hey, old man.

What's the matter? You're just standing there.

Everyone, be quiet for a moment.

I'm going to make a phone call.

A phone call? To where?

It must be very important,
if you're calling from here.

Yes, it's an important and delicate matter.

Everyone, please be quiet.

Oh, I don't know... Which one should I pick?

The sparkly design is more to my liking,

but it's for the charity event tomorrow.

Maybe a refreshing white would be better...

What do you think, Rosas?

They both look lovely on you, Madam.

Coming!

Hello?

Oh, Joseph, it's you.

It's been a while. By the way, where are you?

It's a bit hard to hear you.

R-Right... I'm at a hotel.

I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll be

back any time soon, because of work.

Oh, goodness. That must be very difficult.

Traveling on business to another
country right after going to Japan...

It's been nearly a month now, hasn't it?

Y-Yes. I'm sorry.

By the way, Suzie...

Have you spoken to Holly?

Yes, I just spoke to her on the phone yesterday.

She mentioned catching a cold

that's developed into a bit of pneumonia.

She says it's not serious, but I'm
thinking about going to visit her.

No. There's no need for that.
I'm sure she'll recover quickly.

You're such a worrywart...

This was the important conversation?

Yes. Madam Joestar is full of vitality,

Yes, I'll check up on that myself.

so he needs to check in now and then

to make sure she doesn't visit Miss Holly
in Japan, and discover the truth.

Right.

Meaning that she...

Right.
Of course, she hasn't been told anything.

There's no need to worry her.

It's all right. There's nothing to worry about.

Well...

I see. All right.

I'll hold off on going to Japan.

By the way, Joseph, I have
something I'd like to ask you.

I'm trying to decide between a
white dress and a purple one...

R-Right. Hey, Suzie, could
you let me talk to Rosas?

What?

Madam.

Have you considered your blue dress?

It should be in the back of the closet.

That's right. I'll go take a look.

Hello, it's me, Master Joseph.

Where's Suzie?

She has left the room.

There is no chance of her overhearing us now.

I see...

Actually, right now, I'm calling you
from the submarine that I spoke of.

So you were safely able to
meet up with Master Avdol?

Yes.

So, how is Holly doing?

Have you gotten hold of the doctors
from the Speedwagon Foundation?

Well, actually...

Miss Holly says on the phone
that she only has a cold.

She is quite insistent...

But her condition worsens by the day.

Master Joseph! Perhaps we should
tell Madam Joestar the truth.

No.

There's no need for that.

We will end all of this very soon.

It's best if she can just go
back to her daily routine.

Do not let Suzie know anything
under any circumstances.

I'll contact you again.

As you wish. I pray for your safe return.

Oh, Rosas, did you already hang up?
I wasn't done talking to him!

Madam...

Oh, well. It's fine. Let's have some tea.

You'll have some, too, won't you, Rosas?

Oh?

M-Madam!

Please have a seat.
I shall serve you the tea.

Really?

You have my condolences, Mr. Joestar.

But don't worry. We're here with you.

Egypt's right in front of us.

We must defeat DIO as soon as possible
and save Miss Holly.

That is exactly why I have returned.

Right. Thank you, everyone.

This is actually pretty easy.

I guess it's no wonder you can drive it, Avdol.

For crying out loud!

Hey, don't get overconfident.

There are many obstacles in the sea.

Yeah, I know. All right!
Let's speed up just a little bi—

Polnareff!

That wasn't me!

I'm so tired. Are we there yet?

One, two, three, four, five...

Oh, there are exactly five cups.

Hey!

Hurry up and make some coffee.
I want some now!

Make it yourself, then.

Hey. I can see the coast of Africa.

We're about to arrive!

Near this coral reef, there is an
underwater tunnel formed by erosion.

The exit is 200 meters inland.

Let us surface there.

So, we've finally made it to Egypt.

Yeah, finally.

Egypt, huh...

Yes, finally.

What's wrong?

Nah, I'm just really happy.

It's been a while since all five
of us were last together.

Hey, Kakyoin.

Why did you bring six cups?
There are five of us.

That's odd. I guess I wasn't paying attention.

I could have sworn it was five...

Wh—

What?!

Old man!

Mr. Joestar!

Screech

Impossible!

It's a Stand! At some point,
a Stand got into the submarine!

I-It disappeared!

No, that's not it!

It transformed!

It turned into one of the gauges!

Just as it turned into a coffee cup!

Seriously?

We're at the coral reef!

We were only a few hundred
meters from surfacing in Egypt!

Mr. Joestar is unconscious,
but his wounds aren't deep.

It was just his artificial hand.

Th-The phone?!

Who is it at a time like this?

Ignore it, Polnareff!

Don't get distracted!

It's the High Priestess.

The enemy is using the Stand that
suggests The High Priestess.

You know of it?

I've heard of it.

The name of the the Stand user is Rose.

It's a Stand that can be controlled from far away,

so the user is probably on the surface.

What's its power?

It can turn into anything that's metal or glass,

as long as it's a mineral.

So that includes plastic and vinyl, as well.

Even if we touch it or hit it,

unless it attacks, we have no way of recognizing it.

B-But where did it sneak in here from?

I see... So that's how.

How simple... So it cut a hole and came in?

It broke the surfacing system.

We're sinking faster!

We're suddenly low on oxygen.

Navigation is impossible!

Damn it! Shut up! Who the hell
is it at a time like this?

Jotaro?!

Hey! Don't touch things without thinki—

Hi, Joseph, it's me!

I wasn't done talking to you,
so I made Rosas give me the number.

Why aren't you speaking?

Not to mention, what a rowdy hotel you're in.

I hear something like... a siren?

And the sound of water...
Is a bathtub overflowing?

Sorry, but the old man can't
come to the phone right now.

That voice... Is that you,

Jotaro?! Where's Joseph?

You should be in Japan.

Why are you with your grandfather?

Answer me, Jotaro.

There's nothing to worry about, Grandma Suzie.

The old man has me.

Later. Once things calm down, we'll call you back.

Jotaro!

Hold on! We're going to hit the sea floor!

Oh my God!

I knew this would happen!

Every vehicle we ride in gets destroyed!

I'm never getting in a submarine again.

High Priestess

Rose

How strange...

I could get through until a moment ago.

It seems as though the line is dead.

But...

Why was Jotaro...?

H-Hey, the oxygen's getting thin in here.

Kakyoin.

Did you see which gauge the Stand turned into?

It...

It looked like it turned into this one.

No! Jotaro! It already moved!

It's right behind Kakyoin!

Hierophant Green!

Slice!

Kakyoin!

Roar

Everyone, head toward the door.

It's become part of the hull's
surface and started moving.

You say that, but...

If we stay in this room, we'll all get badly hurt.

Are you all right, Kakyoin?

Y-Yes...

Everyone, head to the next room!

We'll seal this room and trap it inside!

I-Impossible!

I-It already moved and
transformed into the door wheel...

I-I have to take my hands off!

Its nails tore off Mr. Joestar's artificial hand...

What?!

Yes! We got it!

Th-That was close...

Apparently, it can't move faster than Star Platinum.

What should we do with it?

Jotaro, don't hesitate!

Show no mercy! Hurry up and rip its head off.

Aye-aye, sir.

B-Bastard...

Bang

It turned into a razor!

I-Impossible...

It's strong!

I can't believe it landed an attack on Jotaro.

What an enemy...

Wh-What's going on?

I'm not sure what's happening,

but are we in a pinch?

Shut up, old man.

If we touch it, we'll get attacked.

So, we just need to not touch it!

Magician's Red!

Silver Chariot!

It's hard.

Chariot's rapier can't pierce it!

We should strike while it's visible.

Everyone, stand back.

Th-There's still oxygen over here.

But it's just a matter of time.

Are you all right?

Yeah.

Leave it, Jotaro! It'll transform again.

We're sinking, so we need to trap that thing!

We'll figure out how to fight it then!

I, Jotaro Kujo, will end you myself.

Bam

What?! Jotaro, you answered
a phone call from Suzie?

Damn it... You shouldn't have done that.

Well, whatever. Anyway, we'll talk
when we get out of this predicament.

Leave it to me.

Do you have a plan?

Yeah... A brilliant one.

I, Joseph Joestar, have been in
a number of situations like this.

Why was Jotaro with Joseph?

Have you heard anything?

N-No...

But... I was happy to hear that
boy's voice after so long.

I heard he's become rather wild lately,

but deep down, he's a sweet child
who cares very much for his family.

I'm sure he's helping Joseph out in many ways.

Yes, Madam. Master Jotaro and Master Joseph

are most likely fighting a common
enemy together right now.

To save Miss Holly, someone very
dear to them, from the evil curse.

What do we do now?

I'm not sure if it's us or the Stand that's trapped.

Sooner or later, it'll cut its way
out of that room and get here!

We are definitely at a disadvantage in
this closed space filled with machines.

This submarine is done for.

We need to abandon it and escape!

We just need to surface in Egypt!

But we're 40 meters below sea level!

It's not that deep, but how are
we going to get to the surface?

Now we're scuba diving?

I've never done this before...

Hurry up! Step on it!

Good grief.

But I can't make the necessary
preparations to dive with this hand.

Help me out, Jotaro.

Do it yourself.

Next Episode Preview

First of all, make sure not to panic.

The ocean floor is so beautiful...

If it's okay, you'll do this...

If we're in trouble, do this.

I think I'd like to see your face sometime.

Th-This isn't good!

Don't lose your cool.

It's times like these when
men need to be prepared.

It's hard to get this stuff on
without my artificial hand.

Who here has scuba dived before?

Not me.

No.

I haven't.

The High Priestess is still
attacking from the next room!

Quickly, teach us how to dive!

Don't panic, Avdol.

Above all, never panic.

That's the most important thing in scuba diving.

When you're underwater,

for every ten meters you go below the surface,

the pressure increases by one atmosphere.

At the surface, there's one atmosphere of pressure.

We're forty meters below the surface right now,

so we'll endure five atmospheres of pressure.

If we try to surface immediately,
our lungs and blood vessels will burst.

We have to go up slowly,
so our bodies can adjust.

We're near the Egyptian coast,

so we'll go up along the sea floor.

Now...

I'm going to let water in.

This is a regulator. There's a valve inside

that only lets in air from
the tank when you breathe in.

When you exhale, your breath
comes out the left side.

What about your spit?

What happens if spit or phlegm
comes out while you're underwater?

That stuff just comes out here.

By the way, this should be obvious,

but we can't talk underwater.

We'll use hand signals instead.

Let's keep things simple and use two.

When everything is fine,
we'll use this to say "okay."

When things aren't good, use this.

Mr. Joestar, given who we are,

couldn't we use our Stands to talk?

That's a good point.

Aww, but I know a hand signal message, too.

"Your underwear is showing."

Yeah!

We're under attack and could die anytime!

Stop fooling around and let's go!

This room will soon fill with water.

Put on your goggles and regulator.

P-Polnareff!

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
Stardust Crusaders

The High Priestess, Part 2

Wh-When did...

I-It had already transformed into a regulator!

Th-That bastard...

It's going to go in through
his mouth and tear him apart!

This is bad!

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

You've got to drain the room.

It's too late for that!

She must have been waiting for this moment!

C-Crap!

It's inside Polnareff now!

I-It's going to tear him apart!

Wh-What should we do?

Hierophant Green!

Hermit Purple!

Wriggle

H-Hey...

I got it before it went down his throat, Kakyoin!

Me, too!

Let's force it out before it transforms!

We did it!

All right, keep hold of it.

Look! It's transforming into something else.

Clang

A speargun! It turned into a speargun!

Emerald Splash!

Silver Chariot!

Now!

It's reloading!

This isn't good!

H-Hurry!

Hurry up, old man!

I know, I know!

Th-That was close...

It's too soon to relax.

The bastard knows exactly
how to hit us where it hurts.

Polnareff, are you all right?

I-I'm fine...

You guys saved me.

Merci beaucoup.

The sea floor is so beautiful.

I wish I could have come here on vacation.

This is no time to take it easy.

We must surface before our oxygen runs out.

Will it come after us?

I can't see that happening.

The High Priestess can transform
into metals and glass,

but she can't become fish, water, or sea foam.

Just watch your back while you swim.

If she pursues us,

she'll probably transform into
a screw on our gear to do it.

Be careful of moving pebbles and stones, too.

Look, it's a sea tunnel.

Our depth is seven meters.

We're finally at the Egyptian shore!

Swim along these rocks to the surface.

What?!

Th-This is...

The S-Stand... It was disguised as the sea bed!

It's so big...

W-We're being sucked into its mouth!

Crush

I-Impossible!

How is it so gigantic?!

What's with its size?!
What's this Stand's power?!

It was so small earlier!

You boys are so slow.

Didn't you realize that
if the rocks are mineral,

that means the sea bed is
mostly mineral, too?

The Stand's power has increased
because its user is nearby!

She must be very close!

Precisely!

I'm seven meters above, on the shore.

But the High Priestess will grind you all to bits,

so you'll never see my face.

I-I wonder exactly where in the Stand we are.

We're still inside its mouth.

We weren't sucked down its throat.

Hey, Jotaro!

Jotaro, you're my type,
so this will be hard for me.

It's too bad I have to make my Stand,
the High Priestess, digest you.

If only we had met under
other circumstances. How sad.

But if I kill you, Lord DIO will praise me.

Don't hate me!

Good grief. Do I have to say that?

Say it! Come on, just hurry up and say it!

Say what?

I see...

Rose,

I'd like to see your face once.

You might be my type.

I might fall for you.

I-I think she's probably gorgeous!

I can tell from her voice.

Indeed. I get the impression
of an elegant woman.

It's my fortune teller's instinct.

Doesn't she sound like
the actress, Audrey Hepburn?

If only I were thirty years younger.

You bastards! You don't mean any of that!

I'll kill you!

Holy shit!

Everyone, look!

Wh-What is that?

I-It's a tongue!

It's the Stand's tongue!
Look out! Be careful!

Jotaro!

Jotaro!

Where's Jotaro going to land?

Its teeth! The molars!

Jotaro! Dodge!

You'll be crushed!

You want to pit your strength against mine?

S-So strong...

Jotaro! These teeth are as hard as diamonds!

You'll never break them!

I'll kill you first!

Save Jotaro!

Don't get in my way!

It's the tongue again!

Magician's Red!

Th-This isn't good!

Pull him out!

Jotaro!

High Priestess

Rose

Jotaro!

J-Jotaro was crushed by the teeth...

J-Jotaro...

We didn't make it in time?

No, wait. I can hear something.

It sounds a bit far away...

It sounds like it's getting closer.

Th-This voice...

The teeth! It's coming from inside the teeth!

Everyone, brace yourselves!

Huh?

Despite the teeth being as hard as diamonds,

he managed to dig his way out.

Oh, my God!

While he's at it, he's breaking
the other teeth, as well!

For crying out loud...

As usual, that Stand's power is immense.

Hey, we're getting out of here.

Ker-Splash

Good grief. Well, they were pretty hard teeth,

but I still busted them.

I guess your diamonds were a little low on calcium.

That was awful...

Hey, there's a woman passed out over there.

I assume it's Rose, user of the High Priestess.

What should we do? Is she incapacitated?

Maybe I'll go see if she's hot or not!

Looks like she's got a nice figure.

Let's see...

Well? Polnareff?

N-No comment...

Stop! Don't look!

Her teeth are all busted,
so there's no point in looking!

Anyway, we've finally made it to Egypt.

Indeed. In a jet, this trip
would've taken twenty hours.

But it took us thirty days.

We visited many places.

Inside a brain, and even inside a dream.

A dream? What are you
talking about, Kakyoin?

Hey, now. It's morning. Wake up already.

Oh, right. You guys didn't know about that.

Well, whatever. Let's go.

The Stand.

A mysterious, spiritual power
symbolized by the Tarot.

Around the World in 80 Days.

Joseph Joestar once described
their journey in that way.

Traveling from Tokyo to Hong Kong, they encountered Tower of Gray.

On their way to Singapore by sea,

they encountered Dark Blue Moon and Strength.

In Singapore, they encountered
Ebony Devil and Yellow Temperance.

In Calcutta, India, it was
Hanged Man and Emperor.

In Varanasi, India, the Empress.

Near the Pakistani border, Wheel of Fortune.

In the mountains of Pakistan, Justice.

In Karachi, Pakistan, the Lovers.

In the deserts of the
United Arab Emirates, the Sun.

In Saudi Arabia, Death 13.

On a small island in the Red Sea, Judgment.

And now, on the Red Sea floor, the High Priestess.

Aswan
Red Sea
Saudi Arabia
Abu Dhabi
United Arab
Emirates

After defeating many of DIO's assassins,

they have finally arrived in Egypt.

Red Sea
Egypt
Aswan
Where they surfaced

Only a few of the Tarot Cards remain.

But Jojo and the others do not yet know

that new threats still await them.

That's...

One, two, three... nine.

Nine of them? Men and women...

Huh?

What... is that?

Have the flies swarming
nearby been eliminated?

The Speedwagon Foundation...

I can't let my guard down
for a minute. For pity's sake...

I've gotten quite used to this body now.

Do you feel it, Jonathan?

Your descendants are coming closer.

It's so very cruel...

this world of ours.

Oh, I see. So Jotaro is helping you with work.

Good, very good.

Hmph.

He's got a long way to go, compared to me.

So, is your work that important?

Yeah. It's a very important task.

I can't mess it up.

But if we work together, we will get it done.

Say, Joseph. Could I speak to Jotaro?

Sure, but what about?

Nothing much.

Is it wrong that I want to hear
my darling grandson's voice?

No.

Jotaro.

It's me.

I've heard all about it, Jotaro!

Do your best. Take care of
your grandfather for me.

Yeah.

I'm sure if you work together, you Joestar men

can overcome any hardship.

I truly believe that.

Grandma Suzie, you...

Hm? What's the matter?

You sound so serious all of a sudden.

It's nothing.

All right, I'm hanging up.
I look forward to good news. Ciao!

Madam...

It has been thirty years now that
I've worked for the Joestar family.

B-But this is the first time
something like this has...

Oh, you're overreacting.

It's just a business trip, isn't it?

W-Well...

It's so troublesome when men act selfish.

But I'm used to it by now.

The Joestar family has been

like this for a century.

I'm sure she'll say so, too, and laugh it all off.

What's wrong, Jotaro?

It's nothing.

All right, let's go.

The ties to DIO that we've had for a century...

We Joestars will finally bring that to an end.

It's won't just be us.

Hey, Mr. Joestar!

We got the car!

Let's hurry up and go.

Let's get where we're going,
before it gets too dark.

Old man.

Yes, we're quite lucky.

If you don't hurry up,
we're gonna leave you behind.

All right, we're coming.

Egypt: a nation that is 97% desert.

But, thanks to the blessings of the Nile,

beautiful, fertile green spreads
all the way down its river banks.

As well as the culture of the ancient Egyptians,

Egypt is also home to Persian, Greek,
Roman, Muslim, and Arabian cultures.

It is a blended nation.

In this eternal land,

what misfortunes await Jotaro
and the others on their journey?

Episode 25
Iggy the Fool and Geb's N'doul, Part 1

Wh-What's that?

They're here.

It's a helicopter!

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

You don't have to state the obvious.
We can see that.

That's a helicopter from
the Speedwagon Foundation.

They're looking for a place to land.

Speedwagon Foundation?

Your old friends who are taking
care of Mom back in Japan?

Yeah, that's right.

Don't tell me we're going
for a ride in that helicopter.

No. As much as I'd like to,
the crew aren't Stand users.

If we were attacked, they would be at risk.

Then why is that helicopter here?

They've brought us a helper.

What? A helper?

He has a few personality issues,

so it's taken a while to get him here.

Mr. Joestar!

It's impossible for him to
come with us on this trip!

There's no way he could be helpful.

Do you know him, Avdol?

Yeah, very well.

Hold on. If he's a helper,
that means he's a Stand user, right?

He's the Stand user whose Stand
suggests the card called The Fool.

The Fool?

The Fool?

Hah! That card sounds like an idiot.

We're lucky that he's not our enemy.

You wouldn't be able to beat him.

What'd you say, you asshole?

You'd better watch your mouth.

It's the truth.

And what's with the hand? That hurts.

Sounding all high-and-mighty and shit...

Knock it off already.

The helicopter landed.

Mr. Joestar! Thank goodness you're safe.

Thanks for coming out here. I appreciate it.

So...

Who's the Stand user?

I'm asking which one of you is the Stand user.

Is it you?

No, it's not either of us.

He's in the back seat.

The back seat...

I don't see anyone there.

No, he's there.

Hey, hey, hey!

You say he's there, but where is he?

Is he really short or something?

Get the hell out here! Come on!

W-Watch out!

Hm?

What's this sticky stuff?

Please, be careful!

The helicopter ride was rough,
so he's in a really bad mood.

Don't get close to him!

I told you, he's got some personality issues!

Polnareff, you can't win.

And I'm asking where the hell he is—

Whoa!

H-H-H-H-H-He's...

...a dog!

Don't tell me this dog is....

Yes! He is The Fool Stand's user.

His name is Iggy.

He loves to tear out human hair by the mouthful.

We don't know where he was born.

When even the dog catchers in
New York couldn't get him,

Avdol was able to find and finally capture him.

Oh, I just remembered.

While he's ripping out hair, he likes to...

fart in the human's face.
He's kind of vulgar.

God damn it! You're gonna pay for that!

Damn you...

Chariot!

Th-That's...

So that's The Fool.

We met an orangutan Stand user
off the shore of Singapore, but...

Who the hell do you think
you are, you stupid mutt?!

Don't make me cut you in half!

Slice

What the?! It's like it's turning into sand...

I-I can't cut it!

Now it became solid and swallowed up my sword!

That's...

Simply put, it's a Stand made of sand.

Yeah... And the simpler they are,
the stronger they are.

I'm not sure if I could hit it.

Hey! Help! Do something about this dog!

Sorry, Polnareff,

but I'm not about to get
my hair ripped out, too.

You monster!

Do you have his treats?

If we didn't, we wouldn't
have been able to make it here.

Stop! Help me!

His sense of smell is incredible.

What is that?

Coffee-flavored chewing gum.

It's Iggy's favorite treat,
and he'll do anything for it.

Mr. Avdol! Keep the box hidden from—

Oh, no! He got the box!

He loves coffee-flavored chewing gum,

but he still won't let down his guard for anyone.

At least take the paper off first.

There's no way he could actually help us.

Good grief.

Damn it...

My beautiful hair's been thinned...

You stupid bastard!

While he's eating the gum, he should be fine.

Let's get the supplies out now.

Here's some food and water for your trip.

Oh, thank you.

There are medical supplies
and a change of clothes, too.

Also, a new camera, for taking spirit pictures.

TVs don't work so well for spirit photography.

Oh, I know.

Hey, you guys.

I see. It'll make a nice memory.

Avdol! Hurry up with the gum!

But you're already such good friends, Polnareff!

Mr. Joestar, we'll be taking our leave now.

There's something I'd like to ask you.

About my daughter...

How is Holly doing?

Give it to me straight.

Well, sir... I hate to say this,

but I'm afraid she's not doing very well.

Her energy is fading,
and her life remains in danger.

According to the doctors from
our Speedwagon Foundation,

she'll be lucky if she survives
for another two weeks.

There's no time.

Damn it...

Also, we have some information for you.

According to the report, two days ago...

Nine mysterious men and women

gathered in a building that DIO
is believed to be hiding in,

and then they all departed together.

DIO and nine others?

We don't know who they are.

The person who reported this was killed,

and the mansion had already been cleared out.

We were unable to locate
the nine men and women.

Any further investigation of
this matter is impossible for us,

since we are not Stand users.

Were they new Stand users?

Hold on.

Any remaining Stand users with Stands that

suggest Tarot cards...
Excluding Hol Horse's Emperor,

the only card left is The World.

I had thought that The World
would be DIO's Stand, but...

Avdol?

I-I don't know.

I have no idea. Nine of them?

Apparently, DIO's head hasn't
gotten used to its new body yet.

DIO is very proud, so there's
no way he'd flee from Cairo.

It would appear that he's trying
to stop us from reaching Cairo.

Good grief. There's only two
weeks left, and nine of them...

We might end up a little tired.

We'll be off, then.

Please have a safe trip.

Thank you. Take care of Holly.

That dog...

It noticed the presence of the Great N'doul, eh?

Damn. So close.

I was almost able to get it.

I guess I need more practice.

The Nile Ue Ue Fly, eh...

It's because of this fly
that Joestar and the others

were able to pursue Lord DIO this far...

The Fool

Iggy

Mr. Joestar, can't you
do something about this?

Why is that shitty little dog sitting in

the seat while we're stuck in the back?

It's so cramped, my back hurts.

You'll have to wait until the flavor from his

beloved coffee gum fades.

Once that happens, I'll throw
a new piece of gum into

the back so he'll go there.

Then you can change seats.

All right, all right. Calm down! Damn it...

Wh-What the hell?!

L-Look! Over there!

Th-That's...

The helicopter!

The Speedwagon Foundation helicopter
that flew off earlier is down in the sand!

There's no sign that it was attacked.

It's like it just fell to the ground.

It couldn't be!

Be careful!

It's very likely we'll be
attacked by the enemy's Stand!

Look! It's the pilot!

He's dead...

There are marks where he
clawed the helicopter's side...

This is horrible.

Approach carefully.

Something could be hiding there.

It's water.

So much water...

It's coming from the pilot's mouth...
No, from his lungs.

There's even a small fish.

He drowned in the middle of the desert!

What on earth?

H-Hey...

The other one's over here.

He's alive!

Are you all right? Get a hold of yourself!

What on earth happened?

Wa...

Water...

What? You want water?

Polnareff, hand me that canteen.

Right.

Here, get a hold of yourself.
Here's some water.

Drink slowly.

No! The water's going to attack!

What?!

I-It's the enemy Stand!

The enemy Stand is inside the canteen!

D-Damn it!

The Speedwagon Foundation crew wasn't

part of this fight,
but they were still attacked!

Avdol, did you see what kind of Stand it was?

I only saw a hand.

But it's still inside the canteen!

I haven't seen it leave.

Who could it be?

They mentioned that DIO
gathered nine men and women...

Is the attacker one of them, then?

Jotaro, locate the enemy's body.

I'm looking for it right now.

But...

The enemy's body isn't anywhere I can see.

I even looked for something like
that stupid mirror The Sun had.

But it seems the enemy is
operating from very far away.

Polnareff, attack the canteen.

Huh? Me...?

Th-The pilot's head was completely
sucked into that tiny little canteen.

So if I poke a hole in that thing...

Hell no!

Kakyoin! You're closer!

You should just hit it with an Emerald Splash!

I don't want to.

Don't try to make someone do
something you won't do yourself!

What the hell is wrong with you?!

No means no.

Well, I say that I don't want to do it, either!

Th-This is...

Kakyoin!

It's the water!

It had already left the canteen,
along with the blood!

It's not that the Stand was
inside the canteen...

The water is the Stand!

It got Kakyoin!

I-It got Kakyoin's eyes!

Polnareff! Stop panicking!

Bring out Chariot and defend yourself!

Crap. It's going to get Polnareff, too.

What's going on?
It attacked the pilot's corpse!

No, not the corpse. The watch.

It attacked the watch's alarm.

Sound! It attacks by locating sounds!

Sounds?

Shit! Polnareff!

It's coming for you this time!

Run to the vehicle!

I-It's so fast!

Hurry, Polnareff!

It cut me!

Hermit Purple!

It soaked into the ground...

The enemy can detect sound
through vibrations in the ground.

It can move freely around underground,

without being seen, and before we know it,

it can attack us from behind,
or through the bottoms of our feet.

And its user is able to remain far away.

They all got onto their vehicle.

He must have realized that I,
N'doul, was finding them with sound.

Too bad figuring that out
won't do them any good...

H-How's Kakyoin?

It's not good.

He may have been blinded.

Let's drive.

We have to get him to a doctor immediately.

But if we move, it'll attack.

We can't be careless.

What?!

These footsteps... It's the dog.

That dog...

It left the car before my attack.

It anticipated my Stand's attack.

It seems that dog is going
to be a problem after all.

The tires are in the water! Shit!

It's no use. We're being pulled in!

We're going to slip!

Move further back!

Helper! Come on, damn it! Help, already! Hey!

That accursed dog...

It must also know that I'm
only four kilometers to the west.

What should I do...

I'll have to take care of the dog first!

How careless can you be?!

You stupid dog!

No, I'll leave the dog alone.

It doesn't appear that Joestar
and the others can control that dog.

If it's just going to sleep, it's harmless.

Now, without hesitation...

It's so sharp!
It cut the front tires in half!

Go even further back!

S-So that's what it's trying to do...
Shit! Everyone hang on!

I can hear it! I can hear it!

Don't make a sound.

He can smell where the
enemy's going to attack next.

The water started chasing Jotaro!

If we can just find their body,

there's a good chance we
can defeat that fearsome Stand!

It's Iggy.

Everyone, hold on!

Oh, no!

The water sank... Everyone, don't move!

No one make a sound!

It's too late to be quiet now.

I know exactly where each of you fell.

Four... Five steps.

They're tip-toeing.

I hear it, I hear it.

Now, that must have sounded like walking.

Accursed water Stand! Attack that spot.

As soon as you show yourself,
my Magician's Red will engulf you in flames.

Episode 26
Iggy the Fool and Geb's N'doul, Part 2

Here he comes!

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

Wait. Why did he take only five steps?

Why hasn't he moved any further?

Now!

Magician's Red!

What?!

Wha—

Avdol!

Who is out there?

S-So strong...

Avdol!

That was a sneaky little plan.

I must listen more carefully.

Those weren't footsteps at all.

It seems he just threw
some ring-shaped objects.

And this burn...

That must have been Avdol.

But I defeated him.

Time to finish you...

There it is!

...Avdol!

This time, I definitely hear someone running.

You fool! Jotaro, what are you doing?!

Judging from the distance between
footsteps, he's about 190...

No, 195 centimeters tall.

It's not Joestar. These are
a young man's footsteps.

It must be Jotaro.

Jotaro, where are you going?

Hey! It dived!

The water's started chasing after Jotaro.

So that's what he's trying to do.

It won't attack Avdol again, but... Jotaro!

He's going to catch up to you!

I've heard that Jotaro's Stand,

Star Platinum, is the most
challenging of their Stands.

If I can dispose of him, I'm sure
Lord DIO will be very pleased.

For Lord DIO, I'll give my all to defeat Jotaro.

Jotaro picked up something
from the ground just now.

What was at that location?

What was it...

No, it wasn't a thing.

It's the dog! Jotaro picked up the dog.

He must have realized, then.

Good grief, you bastard.

You jumped out of the car
before it got attacked, didn't you?

You can tell where the enemy's
coming from by the smell, can't you?

Don't stop, Jotaro!

Now, then. You're going to help me out, Iggy.

Where's he going to attack? Tell me, Iggy!

Otherwise, you'll die, too!

You won't get any gum from me, either.

Iggy!

He can float, too?

You're not getting away!

I may be heavy, but don't
you dare try to escape alone.

My Star Platinum is incredibly fast.

If you try to shake me off,
he'll snap your neck in an instant.

What? The footsteps disappeared after the jump.

They haven't landed anywhere yet.

Impossible....

This is good.

Jotaro's going to travel through the air

and use Iggy to find the enemy's body.

If we can find the Stand user's body,

our chances of defeating
that fearsome Stand are good.

He's gone...

The sound of Jotaro's
footsteps has disappeared.

Where is he? Where did he go?

Why have his footsteps stopped?

He's gradually losing altitude...

Looks like The Fool can't fly very far.

So now it's just gliding, like a paper airplane?

My feet are about to scrape the ground.

Hey, don't strain so much.

It's making you fart.

Don't make us hit the ground.

I guess there's no choice.

I'll have to help you gain height
by kicking off the ground.

We regained quite a bit of speed from that,

but the sound of that impact
put us at a major disadvantage.

He'll know now that we're
traveling through the air.

I see. That dog's Stand...

It can fly.

And it's coming closer...

Toward me!

I must defeat Jotaro before he gets close!

That guy's Stand is chasing after Jotaro!

He must've figured it out from that step.

We have no choice but to entrust this fight

to Jotaro.

It's coming after me.

A helicopter is loud due to the vibrations,

but Iggy's Stand only makes
sound as the wind hits it.

The enemy probably can't
figure out our exact location.

If I can get to the Stand user
before I lose altitude, I can win!

I finally found him!

I'm about 400 meters away from his body!

It seems the enemy is a blind man.

S-Sand! Sand is falling on me!

He's spiraling sand into the air...

Not good!

He can hear the sand bouncing off of us,

like a submarine's sonar!

I can hear it... The reflected sound.

I even know how high you are...

Jotaro!

Geb

N'doul

Shoot him!

Star Platinum!

No matter how fast Star Platinum may be,

if he can't tell where I'm coming from,
I'm still a second faster!

One more shot!

Th-This dog...

That dog is trying to save itself!

He pointed out Jotaro's location to my Stand.

He's trying to abandon him!

B-Bastard...

You shitty mutt...

You've acquired such a
selfish dog as an ally, Jotaro.

This is the end.

I will gratefully bring this to an end...

Shwoom

Wha—

What? Something was thrown this way!

It's slicing through the wind...

What is it?

It's Iggy.

Come on, now.

If you and Iggy don't use your
Stands to defend yourselves,

there's going to be a collision.

This overwhelming power...

Curses! He's going to crash into me!

What kind of person is he? Throwing a dog...

Damn it! I was one blast away
from finishing Jotaro...

Damn!

I couldn't verify Jotaro's location
because I was too busy with the dog!

Where? Where is he?

He's not moving...

He's staying absolutely still somewhere.

This must be his plan!

Where are you, Jotaro?

Where? Where the hell are you, Jotaro?

Right here.

I see...

I didn't realize you had gotten so close.

If I hadn't recalled my
water Stand to defend me,

you would have already
knocked me out from behind.

I guess I don't need to use this
staff to help me listen anymore.

But I'll need this staff to help me get home.

You knocked off my hat.
Even the ocean couldn't manage that.

But don't worry. I held back.

You aren't critically injured.

Impossible! You just used your own Stand to...

What the hell are you thinking?!

Jotaro, surely you considered interrogating me

about the other eight of us,
who you are about to encounter.

Joseph Joestar's Stand, Hermit Purple,

is able to read thoughts.

So I must not say

anything that might leave
my lord at a disadvantage.

DIO...

Why are you all so loyal to DIO?

So loyal that you'd die...

Jotaro, I have no fear of death.

Because of my Stand's power,

I haven't known fear of death since I was a child.

I could defeat any enemy,

and could commit murders
and other crimes as I pleased.

The police didn't scare me at all.

I'm sure that dog understands how I felt.

He was the first and only person to make
me feel from the bottom of my heart

that I did not wish to die by his hand.

He was so powerful, deep, large, and beautiful.

And he was the first in this world
to acknowledge my worth.

I waited so long to meet him.

I have no fear of death, but...

I feared that he might cast me aside and kill me.

The evil need an evil savior.

I will tell you one thing.

My name is N'doul.

My Stand represents what could
be called the Tarot's origin.

It suggests the deity Geb,
one of the nine Egyptian gods.

Menacing

He is god of the Earth.

The nine Egyptian gods?!

What do you mean?!

I'm only going to tell you about my Stand...

Since it was my Stand that you defeated.
But that is all I'll say...

DIO, who makes fanatics out of people...

Just who is he?

And those who suggest the nine Egyptian gods...?

I don't know what's going on,

but all we can do is continue our journey.

Hey, hey. No need to be defensive.
I'm not mad or anything.

From your point of view,

the old man dragged you out
into a desert against your will,

and forced you into a fight.

That had to be a real pain in the ass.

Hey, Iggy. Want a piece of gum?

Knock it off. I'm apologizing, aren't I?

Here.

Good grief. What an annoying dog.

You're in the middle of the desert.
Do what you want.

Well, I'll be damned.
You picked up my hat for me?

Maybe you're not so bad.

Thanks.

Blob

G-Gum. Y-You shitty little mutt...

You're no ordinary dog.

Hey!

Jotaro!

Jotaro! Are you all right?

Good grief.

Oh? Could that be manga?

How unusual!

So there's manga in Egypt, too?

Would you like a snack?

Tasty
Donuts

Say... I might be asking too much,

but could I take a look at that manga?

I'm a manga artist out on a research trip,

and I'm very interested
in rare manga and books.

In exchange, I'll let you use these binoculars.

What's this? The title is
Zenyatta Mondatta Brothers Adventure.

There's no author credit...

Huh.

These pictures are pretty unique.

It's well-printed, and in full color!

In a certain place,
there lived two very close brothers.

My name's Zenyatta.

My name's Mondatta.

The younger brother, Mondatta, was very shy,

so he couldn't do anything
without his big brother Zenyatta.

He was always alone.

While his big brother, Zenyatta, was out,

Mondatta met a traveler who was very kind to him.

Smile
Smile

The traveler gave him snacks and
let him look through his binoculars.

Mondatta had a very good time.
Peace                                                       Eek Eek

Oh, it's 10:30!

But that kind traveler

impaled his throat on an electrical pole and died.

What a strange manga.

Is stuff like this popular in Egypt?

And this book itself is pretty weird.

The pages from here on are all blank.

Nothing's been printed...

So it's missing pages.

But it's an oddly realistic and thrilling manga.

I know I may be asking too much,
but would you please sell me this book?

Not happening.

What?

My little brother's book is not for sale!

Menacing

Get the hell out of here.

Little brother?

Didn't you hear me?!

Little bro, I told you not to talk to strangers.

There are a lot of bad people in this world.

Everyone! The bus for Aswan is about to depart!

Let's go.

They should be heading to

a hospital in Aswan to treat their wounded.

I see...

I guess we can't do much about that.

We'll have to wait for the next bus.

Ba-bam

Next Episode Preview

We are unstoppable brothers!

Who's there?!

It's me, Polnareff.

Jotaro, what happened to your uniform?

You're acting weird today.

Could it possibly be that you're...

Could it be...

Could it be...

Zenyatta, the predictions are absolute.

Oh, a new page

has appeared.

La la
La

The buddy brothers, Zenyatta and Mondatta,
took the bus that came four hours later.

So they weren't in the accident. La la!

Trot
Trot Trot

What new adventure awaits the buddy brothers?

As they entered the city of Aswan...
"Oh! There they are!"

"The five nasty bad guys are there!"

"They're talking to each other."

They seemed so worried...

It's them.

They drank black tea that was poisoned. Gulp!

B-Brother...

So all we have to do is poison them.

My brother, we are invincible together.

With your Stand, a manga that tells the future,

and my Stand,

which transforms my face...

They're as good as dead!

Our cards are the God of Knowledge,
Thoth, and the God of Creation, Khnum!

We're the Zenyatta Mondatta brothers!

Episode 27
Khnum's Zenyatta and Thoth's Mondatta

It's definitely at this café,

at this table, where they will
drink the poisoned black tea.

Th-The predictions made

by my Stand, the God of Knowledge,
Thoth, always come true.

How are those two doing?

Avdol's neck wound didn't damage
anything vital, fortunately,

so he'll probably be released tomorrow.

But Kakyoin's injuries are serious.

He might go blind.

I'm worried.

Sadly, Kakyoin might be out
of action for the rest of this trip.

Hey, there are a lot of cafés around here.
Let's get a drink and relax.

Great idea. Which one?

My cigarette picked that one.

Welcome.

What would you like?

Let's see... I'd like some black tea.

Same.

All right. Three black teas, then?

No, we'd better not.

Huh?

Listen. We're in Egypt, which is enemy territory.

More enemies are lurking around
us than ever before,

and we don't know when they'll attack.

We have to be more careful than
we've been when it comes to poison.

From now on, only drink from bottles or cans.

What? Are you serious?

I am serious.

Hey, forget the black tea.
We're going to have cola instead.

Cola?!

Yeah. Something wrong with that?

N-No. Okay. Cola, right?

So three colas, then.

Oh, and we'll take the caps
off at the table ourselves.

Also, I want the third, fourth,
and fifth colas from the right.

C-Cola with the caps on?!

I won't be able to poison them...

Was the prediction wrong?

No, my brother's manga is always right.

B-Believe! I must believe in my brother!

If I, the big brother, don't make
an effort to achieve our destiny,

we won't be able to defeat them!

Brother, the predictions are absolute!

Hey, Manager! This cola isn't cold at all.

Your shop serves warm cola?
I'm not gonna pay, you jackass!

Hey, are the colas not cold?

Th-The refrigerator is broken.

You're being too paranoid.

Even if that guy were our enemy,

and if he were really trying to poison us...

How would he know that we'd come in here?

This city has all these cafés,
and I happened to choose this one.

If there were only one café,
maybe, but there are plenty.

I'm just saying that being careful can't hurt.

If you're that concerned, then let's change cafés.

We'll go to the one across the street.

All right.

Fire!

Huh?

My café is on fire!

A spark from a cigarette some jackass
left in the road got into the trash!

Hey, Manager. We'll take three black teas after all.

W-We won...

Man, to throw a lit cigarette in the trash...

This world sure has some real jerks in it.

They're drinking it... They're drinking it!

D-D-D-Drink it all down...

Th-They drank it!

Eek! This dog ate my cake!

Who the hell brought a dog in here?!

Iggy!

Whose dog is this?

Hey! Get this dog outta here!

Damn it, Iggy!

Stop, you shitty dog!

Damn it! They even had it in their mouths!

Shit! What's supposed to happen after this?

I-It doesn't say yet...

B-But the prediction wasn't wrong.

Just, Thoth can only see the very near future.

This time...

This time, we'll use the next
prediction to kill them for sure!

That's right. We're...

The Zenyatta Mondatta brothers!

"Damn that dog! Curses! We failed!"

"We were so close!"

Big brother Zenyatta and little brother
Mondatta were very frustrated.

But after pulling themselves together,

Zenyatta and Mondatta chased
after the three guys and their dog.

Hup Hup

While chasing them,
although this isn't really important,

the brothers passed a man
with a very annoying face.

The brothers hated guys who looked like that.

I bet he did something in a past life...

I'm so pissed off all of a sudden. I'll punch him!

Bam

Ugh!

Even though he had done nothing wrong,
Zenyatta senselessly punched him!

Eek!

The man with the annoying face panicked!

He accidentally dropped his wallet,
which was full of money.

"Yay! We're rich!"

The brothers sure are lucky! Peace!

Idiot.

W-We scored big, Brother.

Ah! B-Brother, it's showing up.

They continued to chase Joestar and the others.

Joestar and the others got in a car

and headed to the hospital
to see Avdol and Kakyoin.

Smile
Smile

Zenyatta planted a bomb shaped
like an orange in their car.

Jotaro went flying!
Kabam

His head was split into two bloody halves,
and he was out of the game for good!

Th-Th-Th-That prediction is so detailed...

Yes!

Khnum

Zenyatta

Clank

Menacing

Kabam

M-M-My Stand, Thoth, can
only see the immediate future.

But once it prints a prediction,
there is no way to change it! At all!

Jotaro will definitely explode!

The bomb will detonate three seconds
after he sticks his finger in to peel it.

Without fail!

His fate

has been decided!

Who's there?

Wha—

Who's in our car?

It's not Jotaro?

No. Jotaro said he was going
straight to the hospital.

Be careful!

C-Crap...

Don't let him get away!

C-Crap! It's Joestar and Polnareff!

Yeah, I know!

Hey, don't hide in there!

Who are you? Come out.

We told you to come out, damn it!

Hurry it up!

Hey, hey, why the panic?

It's me, Polnareff.

Oh, it's you, Jotaro.

My Stand, Khnum, is a transforming Stand.

I can change my height, weight,
and even smell to whatever I want.

I made the hat by transforming my hair!

But what happened?

You said you were going
straight to the hospital.

Huh? Um, uh... Yeah.

I left something in the car, so I came back for it.

My wallet. It was my wallet, yeah.

Good grief.

Jotaro, what happened to your school jacket?

S-School jacket?

Wh-What? What? School jacket?

That's really not a good look on you.

Oh... Right, clothes. School jacket, huh...

I-It's at the cleaners!

I took it to the cleaners,
and didn't have any money.

Th-That was a good answer. Yeah!

Huh. I see...

Then hurry up and get in the car. We're going.

Huh?!

Huh? The car?

I-It can't be...

It can't be... It can't be!

The Jotaro that gets his head blown in half

isn't the r-real Jotaro, but... No! M-M-M-Me?!

Impossible!

Nah, a-actually, I think I'm going to walk...

What the hell are you talking about, Jotaro?

From here, it'll be a lot faster to take the car.

Z-Zenyatta!

C-Crap...

I have to get out of this Jotaro
disguise as soon as possible.

O-Or I'll be the one who gets blown up!

I-I know! I just have to throw the orange away!

I'll just throw the bomb away

and put it back in the car later,

so it can blow up the real Jotaro!

Yes!

There! Now I'm safe!

Hey, it's Iggy! I can't believe he
jumped in while we're moving.

He's got an orange in his mouth!
Did you steal that, Iggy?

That might be a nice gift for Kakyoin and Avdol.

Wha?!

Yow!

"Yow"?

You don't usually make noises
like that. You're acting weird.

N-No... Yow. You know, y-yow.

I-I was saying there was a cyow over there...

Jotaro... You're really weird today.

You're not together, man.

You're not actually...

a fake, are you?

G-Good grief. What the hell are
you talking about, Polnareff?

Are we at the hospital yet?

Say, Jotaro. Do that special trick of yours.

Ba-dum!

Special... trick?

What is he talking about?!

I learned it from you.

You know, this!

Hey, you've gotten better.

O-Oh, that's what you meant.

I'm saved! If that's the trick,
while it seems dangerous, I can do it!

Sure! I'll do it. It's easy.

All right! Do the one where you
have five in your mouth at once!

F-Five?!

Come on! Hurry up and do it.
I wanna see it again.

C-Crap. What the hell kind of
weird talent does Jotaro have?!

I-If I can't do it...

They already think I'm acting strange.
They'll be even more suspicious of me!

Polnareff already looks like he might start
to peel the orange bomb at any time!

A-All right, damn it!

I'll do it!

F-Five, right? Five.

Ta-da!

Come on, hurry up!

I'll do this! I'm gonna do this!
I just gotta do this, right?!

All right! My secret talent!

O-Ow, hot! Hot!

H-Hot... Hot...

I did it! I did it, damn it!

There! Did you see that?! I did it!

People can do anything when
their lives are at stake!

Here.

Last time, you drank some juice
without putting the cigarettes out.

Come on.

Aw, you failed.

Jotaro, are you all right? Oh my God!

Brother! Brother! Mondatta!
Please make this prediction go away!

Get rid of that page!

Zenyatta! The prediction is absolute!

Hurry up and take off your transformation!

If you undo the transformation,
then the real Jotaro will get blown up!

You can do it!

Jotaro, you're acting really weird today.

I-I just... f-feel a bit under the weather...

C-Crap!

K-Knowing them, once they get suspicious,
they're going to keep poking at me!

If I undo the transformation,
they'll beat me half to death,

but if I don't, then I'll get killed by the bomb!

Kabam

Good Idea

Th-That's it! I'll just use feeling bad as an excuse.

I'll say that I have a stomach ache,
and have them let me out of the car.

Jotaro, the way you have your hands together...

You've got your left thumb on top!

C-Crap! Does the real Jotaro
always put his right thumb on top?!

Crap! What am I going to do?!

H-H-H-How am I going to fool them now?

The way you put your hands together proves
that you were a woman in a past life!

My fortune said

that since I put my right thumb on top,
I was a man in a past life!

Wow, really? I always put my
left thumb on top, myself.

Then you were definitely a woman
in a past life, Mr. Joestar.

What do you mean, definitely?

How would you even prove that?

It's so stupid!

M-My stomach really is starting to hurt...

Being with these two is going to kill me.

A-All right. I'm going to tell them
that my stomach hurts...

Jotaro, let's see who can eat
a whole orange faster!

What?!

H-Hey...

Stop, damn it!

Whoa! What are you doing, Jotaro?!

Oh...

Wh-What's wrong, Jotaro?

Oh, it's nothing.

You really are acting weird.

I don't think y-y-you should eat that orange.

Huh? Why?

W-Well, you know...
It's the one Iggy picked up.

It could have been in the gutter.

Eat this one instead.

It's not dirty or bruised. It's fine.

Whatever. I'll eat this one,
and you try with one of those.

Ow!

H-Hey.

My stomach hurts!

My stomach hurts so bad, I can't stand it!

S-Stop the car! Hurry!

Your stomach hurts?

I can't stand it anymore!
Let me out! Let me out!

I'll go behind some rock!

But the hospital's right there...

Just go ahead without me.
Seriously, just go on ahead!

Hold it, Jotaro!

Here's some paper.

I...

I did it!

I actually got away, God damn it!
I finally got away! Serves you right!

I'm gonna go undo my
transformation behind that rock!

An orange that Iggy picked up, huh...

It really could have been in a gutter.

What should I do?

Throw it away?

Yes! Now I can use my Stand Khnum's
powers to undo the transformation.

And then I win!

The Zenyatta Mondatta brothers win!

We win!

Squish!

Ah?

Oh, shit!

What was that sound?

Don't worry about it.
Probably construction or something.

Z-Zenyatta...

S-Speak to me!

We've lost, Mondatta.

No...

N-No! My Thoth hasn't lost yet.
I-I will k-kill them myself!

Mondatta...

Don't, Mondatta.

They're not normal. It's impossible.

I made up my mind! I'll do it on my own!

I can do it on my own!

You were always so shy...
You've grown, Mondatta.

I'm going to kill them!

What's Thoth's next prediction?

Found you...

Th-They're the ones!
They punched me and stole my wallet!

Everyone! If you beat the shit out of them,

I'll make sure you're richly rewarded!

It's that guy!

Brother! I'm really scared!

Despite finally deciding that
he would do it on his own,

Mondatta didn't have time to get revenge.

But don't give up, Mondatta!

That's just how life is.

Huh?

Well, if it isn't Jotaro.

Hey. Took you long enough.

Long enough?

You're way too quick at taking a shit outside!

You got here faster than a car...

And you got your jacket
back from the cleaners, too?

What the hell are you two...

Hey, an ambulance.

Looks like someone's hurt.

That's too bad...

Oranges, huh? I was just getting thirsty.

I'm going to have one.

Oh?

That man's clothes...

Do you know him?

Of course we don't.

Now, let's go find out how
Avdol and Kakyoin are doing.

Ba-dum-tss

The brothers were taken
out of the battle together.

The fight had ended without
Jotaro and the others

even knowing they had been attacked.

Ba-dum-tss.

Hey, look, it's a sword.

He's holding a sword.

It won't come out... It won't even budge.

I want to cut you down now, too.

Use me, and kill them.

Come at me with your Anubis Stand.

Have your wounds healed, Avdol?

Yes. But I'm much happier
that you'll be all right, Kakyoin.

So I will.

He didn't cut my pupils,
so I've been told it will heal soon.

In junior high, one of my
classmates was hit by a baseball

so hard that his eye was mashed in,

but he was fine by the next day.

It was just fluid leaking out of his eyeball.

Seriously?

No!

In a few days, I can take off my bandages.
I'll catch up with you then.

We're less than 800 kilometers
from DIO's lair in Cairo.

Everyone, please continue on, and be careful.

Hmm, the numbers on this receipt from
the hospital... Are they Arabic numbers?

It's so confusing.

This 0 is actually 5, right? And this
dot is actually zero, and this 7 is a 6?

And this wormy-looking one is...

A 4. So, the amount we owe is...

46,350 Egyptian pounds?!

That's expensive!

How cute!

What's with this puppy?

It's so unique.

What in the world? He's chewing gum.

Is he waiting for someone?

He's so well-behaved.

And here I thought he
was just waiting outside.

Good grief.

He's a hit with chicks!

I wonder why he's chewing gum.

What a strange puppy.

Um, hello?

Let me give you some advice.
You'd best get away from that dog.

He may seem charming,

but in general, he hates people.

If you let your guard down,

you'll regre—

D-Damn mutt! G-Get off of m—

I-It stinks!
Oh, goodness! It farted!

So cute!

You get along so well.

W-We don't get along at all!

Damn it, Iggy! Get off of me!

We're heading in, you lovebirds.

M-Mr. Joestar?!

Hey, hang on!

Y-Y-You...

You shitty little dog!

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

Stardust Crusaders

Episode 28  Anubis, Part 1

They say the ancient Egyptians
always buried their dead

beyond the Nile's boundary,
where the sun sets.

That's why the whole city is
on the east side of the Nile.

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

All structures built on the west
side involve graves and the dead.

But our enemies don't
care about east or west.

They'll attack from every direction.

Man, your cow is so lazy.
She's pretty strong, though...

Hey, Chaka! Hurry up and walk!

Stop wasting time!

Damn it! He's so worthless.
Who the hell do you take after?

The cow and the kid both look just like you!

A sword?

What's it doing here?

Hey, look! It's a sword!

Give it here!

What? Did someone drop it?

Who drops a sword?

This is amazing! It looks pretty expensive.

Hey, maybe the owner's around somewhere.

I bet he's in a panic if he dropped this.

Maybe it's just some antique
that's been lying around.

Should we take it to the cops?

Idiot! We could make a fortune if we sold it.

But I'm the one who found it...

If it's just a replica, it's worthless.

Come on! Hurry up and draw it.

Right!

What's wrong?

I-It won't come out! It won't budge at all!

Give it to me.

Here.

Hold that end.

Right.

I-It's no use. The blade isn't even showing at all!

Let me try, too.

Shut it! If I can't do it,
there's no way you could, idiot!

M-My hand!

My hand!

M-My hand! My hand's been cut!

What cut my hand?!

The blade wouldn't even come out!

I haven't touched anything but its hilt!

What a creepy sword...

Hey! Let me try to get the sword out, too!

Shut up! If you want to try, then just do it!

I-It came out so easily.

I didn't even have to pull hard.

But...

I can hear the blade ringing...

I-I'm no expert on swords or anything,

but I've never seen a blade this beautiful.

It looks like a Japanese sword!

It's as if the blade were wet...

What an amazing find!

Hey! Give it here!
You shouldn't be holding it!

Give it to me!

H-Hey, wha...

What... What did you do?!

I-I don't know...

Y-You were standing behind me, Dad.

I-It's not my fault...

What the hell are you doing?! Hurry!

Hurry up and take him to a doctor!

Slice

Th-There's something weird about this sword!

It's like it's got a mind of its own!

Calm down.

Calm down, Chaka.

It is nothing.

Nothing at all, Chaka...

Wh-Who are you?

I can hear a voice from somewhere...

My name is Anubis.

I am the Stand whose card

suggests the God of the Dead
and the guardian of the graveyard.

You unsheathed me.

You shall become my user...

Yes, you are my user!

You have become an expert...

You are an expert in swordsmanship.

You are stronger than anyone.

Wield me, and kill!

Both he and Dad deserved to die.

I feel like slicing you up, too.

Wh-What? H-Hey, Chaka, stop!

Please stop!

Swoosh

I-Impossible! But the cow's not hurt...!

Kill Joestar! Chop up Polnareff!

Slice Jotaro in half!

You are an expert! A master swordsman!

You are stronger than anyone
and can cut anything!

Kom Ombo?

Do we really have time to stop here?

Stop griping.

As long as they let us ride
the ferry, we can't complain.

Man, I'm starving!
Let's get something to eat.

You're so loud. Here.
For now, that'll have to do.

That's for Iggy!

Well, don't worry about it. Just take it.

By the way, where's the restroom?

Let's go look for one.

Hey, mister, over here.

Want some papyrus?

Papyrus is what paper's made of.
Why not buy some as a memento?

Look, look! It's the real thing!

Papyrus?

I'll sell it cheap.

It's totally the real thing?

You betcha. This piece was made
by a famous Egyptian craftsman.

Hm...

This is a fake. If it were real,
it wouldn't rip so easily.

I know these things.

Huh?

Where did Mr. Joestar and the others go?

Huh?

Iggy?! Why, you little... Hold it!

Hey! Pay for this!

That stupid dog totally gave me the slip...

Menacing

Hey.

You've got some balls,

to attack with so many people around.

It's unusual, too.

You guys usually don't let us see you,
or attack us head-on.

That's pretty manly.
I didn't think any of you were like that.

Identify yourself.

My name is Chaka.

I am the user of the Stand which
suggests the God of Death, Anubis.

Jean Pierre Polnareff,

I will take your life.

"I will take your life"?
That's a pretty straightforward line.

You're a tougher, more manly enemy than I thought.

Come at me with that Anubis Stand of yours!

Chariot!

He's got a sword, but...

Does he plan to fight me with that
sword instead of using his Stand?

Something's wrong.

The way he moves... The way
he wields the sword, his stance...

He's a complete amateur!
But something's not right.

This isn't good.

I should keep my distance.

Anubis

Chaka

Wh-What the hell?

The sword passed through the pillar.

And my shirt isn't cut!

He somehow cut just me, but not my shirt!

If I hadn't kept my distance, I'd be dead now.

You bastard! Chariot!

Stop hiding, and show yourself!

C-Crap...

What the hell? I lost him.

I-I don't know which pillar he went behind.

That Stand can phase through
matter to cut its target.

My Chariot is only able to strike at
a bit more than a meter, at best...

Damn it. He's got me at a disadvantage.

Attacking me, Polnareff, with a sword and
getting a hit in... You've got some nerve.

But this is the end of
you and your confidence.

Well, Chakster, how about this?

Bring it on!

All I have to do is stay away from the pillars!

You're not gonna pop up out
of the ground at me, are ya?!

What?!

The pillar...

I can do more than just pass through them!
I can cut the pillars themselves in half, too!

Die, Polnareff!

Th-That was close.

That's Chariot's secret technique,
which not even Jojo knows about.

Launching the blade like that...

I only have one blade. If an opponent
dodged that, I'd be unarmed.

So I only use that attack
when I'm in real trouble.

Well, I guess he's not dead.

Definitely down for the count, though.

That's strange...

The sword's still in its scabbard.

Did it just slip back in by chance?

Now that I see this sword up close,

it's really beautiful.

I think I'll pull it out more...

Hey, Polnareff. There you are.

You went off by yourself, so we were worried.

What if the enemy attacked you?

Polnareff?

Huh? O-Oh. It's you, Mr. Joestar.

I'm not sure if it's because

I turned around too quick, or because
of my wound, but I feel so out of it.

Polnareff, why are you crouching?

Did you step on a turd?

What? You've got a sword...
Did something happen?

Yeah... A stupid guy decided to attack me.

What? The enemy?!

It's over now.

He said he was the Stand Anubis's user.

He was an expert swordsman, able
to phase through objects and cut them.

He was a powerful enemy.

"Of course, he definitely wasn't as strong as me,"

Polnareff thought to himself.

He attacked me with this swor—

Huh?

It's gone?!

Mice! Mice are trying to take the sword!

Hey!

Talk about creepy...

So thieving mice living down here?

If you're gonna steal,
steal some damn cheese!

How strange...

Now the sword is in so tight,
I can't get it out.

Polnareff!

I'm glad that you're safe,
but we should always travel in pairs.

Be careful!

Our enemy won't hesitate to
attack anyone who's found alone.

Oh, no! That's our ship's whistle.

Let's hurry back. We're going to Edfu today.

Wait. Hey!

Polnareff...

What are you going to do with that sword?

I'm going to hand it over to the police,
since it's clearly a dangerous weapon.

Yes, that would be best.

If you left it in those ruins,
you don't know who might pick it up.

It looks valuable, too.

Hey, Iggy! Quiet!

What if we get thrown out?

What the hell is with you today?

Well, the damn dog won't shut up.

I guess I should take care of it now.

Polnareff! I thought we told
you not to go off on your own!

I just told you! Jotaro, go with him.

Right.

Hey. Shouldn't we get to the police station?

Oh, come on!

A man's got to look his best, right?

Oh, right.

Hey, Pops, would you put
this sword over there?

Sure.

No matter how you look at it,
it's clearly a dangerous weapon.

I was rolling around so much yesterday

that this handsome nice guy got all dirty.

Make me shine, Pops.

Sure.

Ow! Ow...!

Hey, Pops! That razor's dull.

Sharpen that thing!

This ought to be the best part of a haircut!

Good grief. You're such a whiner.

Really? Sorry about that.

Good!

Now it's cutting good and close. Feels nice.

That's so... good to hear.

Très bien! Très bi-e-n!

Could you get under my chin, too?

Sure.

Right here... underneath your chin, correct?

Right under your chin! Right, Polnareff?!

What?!

It's me, you fool.
The Stand that represents Anubis!

Next Episode Preview

Grr, grr!

The sword itself is a Stand!

I won't lose to someone I've faced before!

He's strong...

The more I fight him,
the faster his attacks become.

The look in Polnareff's eyes...

I'll have your head!

Right under your chin! Right, Polnareff?

What?!

It's me, you fool. The Stand that suggests Anubis!

Wh-What should I do?

Die!

I'll shave your chin right off!

Wh-What the hell are you?!

Aren't you the owner of this place?

C-Could it be that sword...

The sword is actually the Stand,

and it controls the wielder?

So the guy in Kom Ombo wasn't the user?

Polnareff...

No matter how many times you try,
you're still no match for me!

Th-The power in this sword...

After last time, I memorized
your Chariot's moves and powers!

I'll never lose to someone I've fought before!

Come on, now.

Come on, you've almost got it.

Episode 29  Anubis, Part 2

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

Oh?

Polnareff and Jotaro seem to be taking a while.

Polnareff, what's...

Who is that?

Stay back, Jotaro!

Th-This sword is a Stand.

It'd be pretty dangerous for your Star
Platinum to fight it with his bare hands.

And the guy's not the user! He's just a puppet.

N-Not to mention, this Stand's gotten stronger!

You bastard!

Whoa, there.

Does that sting?

Now I've learned just how much
punishment you can take, too.

I wonder if you'll be able to
withstand this next attack, Polnareff.

Polnareff!

I-It's getting stronger... with every strike!

I-I can't take this. I-I can't hold him back!

Now!

Take this!

What?!

I've learned all of your attack patterns.

Once I've fought an opponent,
even if my wielder has changed...

No matter what, no matter what,
no matter what, no matter what...

I won't lose!

I-It's no use. I don't have a weapon anymore...

C-Crap! Help me out, Jotaro!

Star Platinum!

D-Did it work?

No, not even close.

It took everything I had just to land that punch.

Hey, Khan. Are you all right? Hey...

Shit. This thing is strong.

This is the first combat Stand

we've seen in a while that doesn't
rely on schemes or spells...

Just as I'd expect from Star Platinum.
You're as fast as I've heard.

But now I've learned all of those moves.

Menacing

Wh-What's wrong, Khan?

Stay back!

He's being controlled!
If you don't want to be cut down,

get indoors and hide!

Th-This isn't good, Jotaro.

The more we fight it, the faster it gets.

Th-The next attack will be the fastest,

strongest, and most intense attack yet!

Out of the way, Polnareff.

He's trying to cut me down.

Run, Jotaro!

Die!

H-He caught it?!

I can't believe you caught my blade...

I see. Star Platinum's strength doesn't
come from its speed and precision alone.

It's also Jotaro's ability to stay cool under fire.

Yes, I know that now...

Is he dead?

No, he's just unconscious.

Jotaro, don't touch that sword!

Even now, the Stand's evil
powers could still be active.

Anyone who touches the
drawn blade falls under its spell.

Let's sheathe it, but without touching it.

What should we do?

If it gets drawn again, we'll be in trouble.

This thing's learned about our powers.

We may not be able to beat it again.

How about we toss it in the Nile
to lay at the bottom forever?

Forever, huh? That's a good idea!

Hold it! This is the police!

Nice timing. Could you get this guy to a hospital?

I came when someone reported
a fight, and I find this!

Why do you have a sword?!

Hand it over!

Hey, stop!

Don't pull it out!

Gwaaang

Polnareff!

It can't be...

Polnareff's e-eyes...

Did he fall under the
spell of the cursed sword?

Hey! You drew the sword!

I drew the sword?

Hey, now. Don't you dare lie.

Aren't you an officer of the law?

H-Hey, what are you doing?

You're the one who drew it, aren't you?!

I don't know where the Stand's real user is,

but it seems Polnareff's fallen under their spell.

But I've never thought about
fighting Polnareff before.

I know I can't hold back
if I end up fighting Chariot.

Even if I win, it'll mean killing Polnareff.

Don't forget that I, Anubis, have
learned all of Star Platinum's moves.

Someone I've fought before can
never, ever hope to defeat me!

Hey, now.

H-His speed... This isn't good!

He's getting faster. I-I can't take much more...

I have to stop the sword!

I'll have to catch it again!

It sped up!

I'll have your head!

Wha—

What tremendous speed and power.

This is the fastest Stand that we've faced.

I-I'm going to lose this fight.

If I don't fight Polnareff with my full
strength, I'm going to be killed.

To think you'd escape from a
failed blade-catch with a headbutt...

I almost had you. Too bad.

But...

I know that move now, too.

Jotaro.

You're thinking about how you'll die
if you don't kill Polnareff, right?

How weak of you. Weak, weak!

I'm going to show you something so amazing,
it'll finish you off right here and now.

Can you

beat this,

Jotaro?!

Silver Chariot plus Anubis: dual-wielding!

Anubis

Khan

This isn't good...

If he gets faster on top of having an extra sword...

Even my Star Platinum...

What's the matter? Did you fall asleep,

Jotaro?!

I'll stop him before he kills me!

Star Finger!

My right arm is as light as a feather now.

I see. I guess that was one option...

You look shocked.

Here I go! Undone armor!

You fool! There's no way your "ora ora" can
withstand two master Stands' dual swords!

Your chest is wide open!

Stab

I've got you now!

I did it! I won!

Lord DIO! I've taken care of Jotaro!

I, Anubis, have defeated Jotaro!

Yes!

Don't think you'll be able to
stop the blade or pull it out.

This cursed sword has already

memorized and surpassed the
power of your Star Platinum.

I'll just push it in farther...

Y-You're going to push it in?

Yeah, that's right!

Indeed I will! Lord DIO will be pleased!

S-Stop. Don't push it any further...

It'll be murder.

I will not stop! I'll push it in
and tear your guts to shreds!

Bam

Wh-What?!

I-I'm going to snap! I-I have to pull free!

Stop!

By the way, didn't you say
you were going to tear me up?

Crack

That's why I said that if you pushed
it in any further, it would be murder.

The sword had stopped moving,
so it was easy to target.

Still, that was a strong enemy.

This last move took everything I had.

I'm glad it was enough to defeat
him before he could learn it, too.

This is the first time I've ever felt so tired.

I have to hurry and meet up
with Avdol and the old man.

Wh-What happened to me?

D-Don't tell me I was being
controlled by the cursed sword...

Yeah... But it's over now.

Sorry...

Polnareff, get the old man and Avdol.

I'm too tired to walk.

It's shining...

And now I've learned it...

The true user of Anubis was the blacksmith

who forged this sword
over five hundred years ago.

Now only his Stand remains.

This means that I am a Stand with no user.

Lord DIO pulled me out of the
darkness of a museum storeroom.

Lord DIO's Stand, The World, is a powerful
Stand that I could never hope to defeat.

That's why I swore my loyalty to him.

Jotaro, no matter what, I'll kill you!

Sparkle

I've learned all of your powers.

My ultimate speed...
Here's a band-aid.

You'll never see it coming!
I don't want it.

I'll stab you in the back!

Die, Jotaro!

Wh-What?!

Shit! I missed! I tripped on that dog!

Where did that dog come from?!

Hey, it's Iggy.

What are you eating? Some candy?

Eating that right off the ground...
What a filthy mutt.

Th-That river is...

The Nile River!

N-No, this can't be real!

At this rate, I'm going to fall in the river!

If I fall into the river, I'm done for! I'll rust away!

Someone stop me!

Yes! On this air current,
I'll hit that wall and stop!

Lucky!

What?!

Shit! I was so panicked, I accidentally used
my power to phase through the wall!

I'm going to fall!

Yes! A boat appeared! I'm saved!

If I stick in the boat,

the boatman will get curious
and try to pull me out.

Then, I'll take over his mind!

Once I control the boatman,
I'll begin my counterattack on Jotaro!

Ack! A cow was on the boat!

W-Wait! Stop struggling! Hey!

Calm down, you stupid cow!

I know! I'll take over the cow's mind!

And then...

I won't make it in time!

Hey, look. That cow over there's
freaking out about something.

Good grief. Who cares?
Just go get the old man and Avdol.

Help!

H-Hey, fishies. Come here a sec.

Come on, touch me.

Hey, wait! Where are you going?

Hey, Mr. Crab.

Come on, take me up to the surface.

I'll give you something good to eat.

Wait! Don't leave me, Mr. Crab!

I'll be rusted through in couple of days!

H-Help me!

Don't leave me!

I'm so alone!

Anubis

Anubis Retires

Stupid mutt.

What are you looking at?

There's nothing to eat over there.

Wha—

I-It stinks!

What the hell do you eat to make
your farts smell like this?!

Polnareff...

To think, all of that happened without us.

The Anubis Stand, huh...
That must have been rough, Jotaro.

Yeah...

Stop! Get off of me!
I'm never going anywhere with him again.

Stop it already, you stupid mutt!

Star Platinum

Jotaro Kujo

Though they may all look similar to tourists,
there are many races that live in Egypt.

This is a typical Egyptian,

wearing a garment called a jellabiya.

This man is a Nubian.

This is a Bedouin, a man of the desert.

This is an Indian, who has nothing to do with this.

And this doesn't have much to do with race, but...

Hey! That chick's legs are smokin'! So hot!

I can't keep my eyes off of her.

Like, bam! They pull you right in!

Is something wrong, Mr. Joestar?

There is something wrong!

What do you think you're doing,
you old pervert?!

Something is wrong.

When you encounter something
you aren't supposed to touch...

My body!

...that just makes you want to touch it.

Pardon us.

How are you feeling, Mr. Kakyoin?

I've never been without my vision
before, so it's a bit unsettling.

Does it hurt?

Not much. I think the painkillers are working.

I see. That's good.

Hello, Mr. Kakyoin.

Doctor, when do you think I
can take off these bandages?

I don't have any time to waste.

Mr. Kakyoin, while your eye
injuries are not life-threatening,

they are not minor, either.

I'm afraid we won't be able
to discharge you anytime soon.

To be honest, I can't even give you an estimate.

Just kidding!

It's true that you'll need time to heal.

But just a moment ago,

for some reason, we were contacted by
doctors from the Speedwagon Foundation.

They asked that we put you in their care.

With their advanced medical techniques,

I'm sure you'll recover much more quickly.

So exactly who are you, anyway?

The Speedwagon Foundation is world-famous.

I don't think they'd get involved
with an ordinary high school student.

I have an acquaintance who's
very reliable, that's all.

Thank you, Mr. Joestar.

I might be able to join
you sooner than I expected.

Jotaro, Polnareff, Avdol, Iggy...

Please wait for me.

Episode 30  Bastet's Mariah, Part 1

This is Luxor, a city about halfway up the Nile.

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

In ancient times, it was called Thebes.

Far to the west of the Nile,

there lies a valley where the
pharaohs of old were laid to rest.

This is the Valley of the Kings.

The tomb of the famous King Tutankhamun
lies in the Valley of the Kings.

Wow, so this place is pretty historical.

Apparently, there are still people who

dig underneath their houses
in secret to the government,

hoping to find gold and treasure.

I wonder if there are still any
tombs or treasures left to be found.

There may be.

By the way, where did the old man go?

To the bathroom.

Iggy's with him, so if anything
seems odd, they'll notice.

Bathroom?

Do you need to go, too?

If it's a real bathroom, sure.

Oh my God!

The air's so dry, the poop turns
into dust and flies away.

So instead of using water,
this toilet uses the wind?

And there's no paper.

This is...

Could this be a sand washlet?!

You clean your ass... with sand?!

Desert sand is sterile.

Oh my God!

I'm not Polnareff, but I think I'll
wait until we're at the hotel.

With a bathroom like that,
I might as well just go behind a rock.

That's a strange sight to see in Egypt.

This makes no sense.

Why is there an electrical outlet in this rock?

What would you even use it for?

It's not like it could be wired to anything.

I-It shocked me...

Mr. Joestar, what's the matter?

We're going to head out soon.

Huh? R-Right...

Got it. I'll be right there.

But what a surprise that was...

Since there's power running to it,

does that mean they
have electricity around here?

What a strange place.

How surreal...

Bam

Her card represents the Goddess Bastet.
The user's name is Mariah.

You always want to touch what's off-limits.

We could make it to Cairo in two
days, but we're all injured.

Why don't we spend tonight and
tomorrow in Luxor to take a break?

Let's do that. Ever since we got to Egypt,

the enemy Stands have been getting stronger.

We've just barely been winning.

Hey, Mr. Joestar, is something wrong?

My prosthetic hand's been acting up.

Well, I'm sure the joints just need oiling.

Hey! Isn't that radio broken?

How strange. It's made in Japan,
and I just bought it...

That static's irritating! Could you turn it off?

Mr. Joestar?

Yeah, I agree. We should probably
rest up before we enter Cairo.

But we cannot let our guard down.

All right. Let's find a hotel.

How strange.

Thanks, old man.

Ah, thank you!

Hey, the radio suddenly works.

Huh? That's weird... My hammer's so heavy...

Wh-What?!

Th-The nails... The nails! It hurts...

What? Did you hit your fingers?
Be more careful!

Slamming that hammer around is dangerous.

For crying out loud...

Mr. Joestar...

Mr. Joestar, please wake up.

Hey, hurry up!

Polnareff is fussing about
getting breakfast somewhere.

Hurry and wake him up, Avdol!

Tell him to be down here in five minutes!

Most old people wake up early in the morning.

Damn it. What a rude little shit...

Tell him I'll be right down.

Right.

Did my watch stop?

But you know, Mr. Joestar...

For a man of your age,
your sleeping habits are quite amazing.

You've turned a full 180 degrees.

You fell asleep facing south,
but now you're facing north.

Perhaps that proves you're still young?

I'll be waiting downstairs.

Something strange has been
going on since last night...

And my prosthetic hand's still acting up.

Wh-What's wrong with this chair?!
It's moving on its own!

Could it be that the whole floor isn't level?

This was a pricey hotel, but it
must have been built on the cheap.

Where should we go today?

The Karnak Temple was amazing,
so I'd say something like that.

It's a bit far, but how about
the Valley of the Queens?

What the hell are you doing, you dirty old man?!

Pervert!

I-I have no idea what's going on...

Flip

Oh, my. What a forward, aggressive approach.

You're j-u-s-t my t-y-p-e...

Smooch!

Oh my God!

Something strange is going on!
Something really strange!

Something has seemed off since last night!

What?!

Th-This is...

Th-They're sticking to me...

All of this metal is sticking to me...

Steel is fixing itself to my body!

Could it be that my body...

My body...

Has it turned into a magnet?!

Ow!

Th-This magnetism... Could it be a new Stand?

But why? Why can't I see the Stand?

Why are the knives and forks flying
at me without a Stand around?

C-Could it be...

Has the shock from that rock
turned my body into a magnet?

I-I can't get loose...

O-Oh, no! The escalator is made of steel!

And the magnetism is getting
stronger by the minute!

What?!

H-Hey, you! The lady in the miniskirt!

This is trouble!

Your chain's gotten tangled
around my hands and body,

and it's getting dragged into the ramp!

Push the emergency stop button
at the bottom of the escalator!

At this rate, your chains will get dragged in,

and they'll chop my hands and feet off!

H-Hey, are you listening?

Enjoy, Joseph Joestar.

Wh-What?! D-Don't tell me you...

You're the Stand user?!

Bastet

Mariah

D-Don't tell me you...

You're the Stand user?!

Rumble                                       Rumble

Once you're ensnared by my Stand
Bastet's magnetic energy,

there's no way to break the spell.

S-Someone! Someone stop this escalator!

I-I know!

I'll push the emergency stop button...

With my Hermit Purple!

Y-You're kidding! It's not there?!

Th-The emergency stop button isn't there?!

I-Impossible! This escalator

doesn't have a button?!

I'm getting pulled in!

My neck! My neck!

It's gonna cut my head off!

This is the end!

It's gonna cut my head off!

Ahem. Ahem!

This is the end! I'm going to die!

Mr. Joestar. Ahem! Hello, Mr. Joestar.

Gonna be chopped right off!

Ahem.

The escalator has stopped.

I pushed the emergency stop button.

It was on the side.

No problems!

This escalator inspection has found no problems!

The stop button works just fine!

Hey, are you from the hotel?

Could you sign off on the inspection? Right here.

What are you talking about, Mr. Joestar?!

The enemy. I'm under the
spell of an enemy Stand.

My body is like a magnet now...

She turned me into a magnet!
Steel sticks to me!

Pull this thing off me!

And the magnetic force
keeps getting stronger...

It's her! That woman is the user!

What?

Catch that woman!

We have to stop her magnetism at once,

or it'll get so strong,
I won't be able to move!

Let's go get Jotaro and Polnareff!
They're waiting outside.

What?!

Grab

This... It's heavy...

Avdol?!

We can't wait on Jotaro and Polnareff!

That woman's going to escape.

Mr. Joestar, don't stay! Go!

R-Right!

I'll at least get a look at her face!

Th-This is...

Sh-She went into the women's restroom.

What should we do?

I'm going in.

My life depends on it!

I'm going to catch that woman, no matter what!

Mr. Joestar?!

The old man's not here yet?

Yeah. Avdol went to get him,
and he's not back, either...

Could it be...

They secretly...

went to eat something
super-delicious without us?!

He's just taking his time in the restroom.

If they don't show up in the next five
minutes, we'll go look for them.

Oh, right. Restroom. Yeah, that's possible...

Come to think of it, the toilets
in this hotel were so clean...

Mr. Joestar, it's good that we came in here...

But as I expected, most of the stalls are in use.

Shh!

Oh, shh...

Sorry. But I-I don't know...
Which one is she in?

She has amazing legs.

H-Her legs?

Yes! Look for those legs!

You'll know right away if you spot them.

W-We're going to look in?

That's not it.

Or these...

Nope.

Menacing

M-Mr. Joestar, right here!

Come here! Are these her legs?

Bam

Oh, my. You're the wonderful man I met earlier.

You came all the way here this time?

What a bold approach...

Smooch!

Holy shit!

It's that old hag! But she was upstairs!

Th-This isn't good!

We got the wrong person.
This is incredibly bad...

How could you screw that up?!

Avdol, run!

Wai—

Perverts!

This is not in line with my image!

Bathroom disaster is Polnareff's thing!

It's a peeping old man!

How awful!

You perverts!

No, you're wonderful!

She's headed that way!

Damn it. When did she get over there?!

After her!

A-Avdol, I forgot to tell you earlier,

but don't touch anything that
looks like an electrical outlet.

Don't touch it, no matter where it is!

That's the enemy's Stand!

You'll feel like you've been shocked,
and then the magnetism starts!

I'm afraid I've touched it, Mr. Joestar.

What?! Wh-Where?!

When I pushed the emergency
stop button at the escalator...

There was an outlet nearby,
and it shocked me.

Th-That woman...

M-Mr. Joestar, please don't run so close to me.

It's hard to move with you stuck to me.

Y-You get away, Avdol!

What are you talking about?
You're the one getting closer!

Two magnets, when close together,

will attract each other!

To think that my body, too,
would become a magnet...

Mr. Joestar, this situation...

Yeah, it's extremely bad.

Th-This enemy...

This enemy...

She's strong!

Next Episode Preview

My body, too, became a magnet...

We can't help it!
We're both in her power now.

What a strong woman!

What should we do? At this rate...

I've never backed down from a fight!

I'm just going...

Oh, my. What a forward, aggressive approach.

Smooch!

Oh my God!

Avdol, I forgot to tell you earlier,

but don't touch anything that
looks like an electrical outlet.

I'm afraid I've touched it, Mr. Joestar.

What?!

Two magnets, when close together,

will attract each other!

Mr. Joestar, this situation...

Yeah, it's extremely bad.

Episode 30
Bast's Mariah, Part 2

Hey! Wait!

Damn it...

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

She went around the corner! After her!

Stuck

This is absurd! I can't believe
my body's become a magnet, too!

Calm down, Avdol!

We can't help that her power's taken hold of us.

Just think about fighting and defeating her Stand!

Where did that woman go?! Damn it!

I don't see her.

Anyway, we can't stay here like this forever.

Stand up slowly, Avdol.

Understood.

We managed to stand up.

N-Now, let's try to separate ourselves.

If we're stuck together,

that must mean twice the
magnetic force is affecting us.

Let's go to that fence, grab hold, and pull apart.

Here we go, Avdol. Use your core muscles!

Get a rhythm going!

Right, Mr. Joestar.

One! Two!

One, two.

One! Two!

One, two.

One! Two!

One, two.

Ah...

M-Mr. Joestar...
Th-This is very embarrassing.

Hey! What are you looking at?

We're just practicing a dance. A dance!

Y-Yes, dancing outside is truly the best!

Go away, damn it!

All right. Just a little more, Avdol.

One, two, and...

We did it! We made it this far without tripping.

I-Indeed...

Avdol, do you think you can slowly slide off of me?

Yes, I think I can.

All right...

I'll hold on to this fence.

Try to slide down my body,
and move away from my toes.

Since our heads are sticking together,

our heads and feet must have opposite polarities,

Positive
Positive
Negative
Negative

letting us separate there.

R-Right...

Y-Yes, just like that.

Wh-What's wrong, Avdol?

Th-This position...

Doesn't this look very risqué?

If anyone saw us, they might get the wrong idea...

N-No one's looking! Hurry up and slide free!

They brought even more friends!

H-Hey! Go away! Stop looking at us!

Hey! I said go away, you damn brats!

Avdol, hurry! Hurry up and slide off!

That's easier said than done...

This is not the role I've taken! I swear it isn't!

Fine, then I'll move!

M-Mr. Joestar, slow down!

Stick

Mr. Joestar, if you move like that...

I-It's the old lady from the hotel!

I thought you were a wonderful gentleman,

but to think you're into this sort of filth!

How dare you play with a woman's heart?!

You cheater!

Hurry! Hurry, Avdol! I'm starting to cry!

You villain!

Help me! Oh my God!

Wait... This is a misunderstanding!

We did it!

We need to stay apart, Avdol!

Your magnetism is growing stronger and stronger.

Curse you, damned fool! Go to hell!

There she is. It's that woman.

She's got some nerve,
just sitting there and smoking.

Avdol, approach her from that side.

Don't let her get away this time.

She seems like a strong woman.

She may have laid a trap for us.

N-No, Mr. Joestar...

It seems we've already fallen into her trap!

Bam

A railroad track!

M-My foot is stuck!

A-Again...

...we're...

...stuck together!

Son of a bi—

What is it, Mr. Joestar?

This sound... O-Oh, no! We can't stay here!

Avdol, use Magician's Red's
flames to slice the rails!

We need to get away now!

B-But, Mr. Joestar...

It's coming! The train's coming!
Hurry up and slice the rails!

I-I can't. If I were to slice these rails...

The train would derail, causing a
huge accident and killing many people!

That woman... How dare she...

Even if I tried to grab her with my vines,
she's out of my Stand's range.

But I can try using that post to pull us free...

I-It's no use! The magnetism's gotten stronger.

Mr. Joestar, keep pulling! You can do it!

I-It's coming! Pull harder!

What?!

Ker-thump

I've won.

Bast

Mariah

I've won, Lord DIO!

Now to kill Jotaro and Polnareff!

Good thinking, Avdol! You burned
through the railroad ties and dug a hole!

This is it! This!

This suits the image of Mohammed Avdol!

This is the role my character plays!

C-Clever little bastard...

You...

shit-eating bitches!

Magician's Red!

Swoosh

Hermit Purple!

Grab

I've got you!

Now, young lady...

I regret that I'm now going
to strangle you enough

to put you in the hospital for a week.

Your magnetism is rather troublesome, you know.

Boom

Boom

What are you imagining?
My chest didn't get bigger...

Your magnetism just got stronger.

This is what I had in my pockets.

The weapons I had in my pockets!

Mr. Joestar, duck!

Magician's Red!

Your magnetic force will keep growing stronger...

Until your bodies are crushed.

She's getting away!

No, she's not escaping.

She's keeping a certain distance between us.

I'm sure that woman fights by
staying neither too close nor too far.

If she gets too close to us, she'll be caught.

If she goes too far, the magnetism stops working.

This magnetism is the work of a Stand,
so it follows the rules of Stands.

Once the user is too far away, its power weakens!

What shall we do?

She said the magnetism would keep getting stronger.

Shall we flee until the magnetic force expires?

No. Even if we were able to
escape this magnetism,

it won't mean we defeated the Stand.

I, Joseph Joestar,

have strategically retreated from
fights in my younger days,

but I've never once abandoned a fight.

I'm going to keep fighting with all my might!

This is a map of the city.
Right now, we're here.

The woman is here.

If she continues down this road,
she'll loop around and head back this way.

We'll split up

and catch the woman here.

I won't think of her as a woman anymore.

I'll get her, no matter what!

After her!

Hey, look.

The rails have been cut...

People from the city have arrived.

I'm sure they'll report the damage
before the next train comes.

Let's go!

Seems like something's going on.

Someone cut the rail line!

Will the trains be okay?

They've stopped running for now.

Someone cut the rail line?

That's a pretty crappy thing to do.

Why would someone do that? Are they stupid?

You know, Jotaro...

I think people like that
will get what they deserve.

I spent three months' pay on this.

Let's get married!

Oh, my...

Huh? Wait, what?!

Huh?

They're chasing as fast as they can...

B-But they'll never catch me.

Stay calm. Gotta stay calm...

Looks like you can barely move now.

You won't be able to chase me anymore.

You think so?

I know these roads better than you do.

Look behind you.

It's a pincer attack!

We've finally cornered you.

Now, at the last moment, the tables have turned!

A pincer attack?

You still don't get it.

You think you've cornered me,
but it's you two who are cornered.

Look above you!

High voltage power lines!

Crap! Power lines are...

That's right. Power lines are magnetic.

You'll burn to a crisp!

Magician's Red!

Hermit Purple!

Avdol can defend himself
with his flames, just barely,

but you have no chance, Joestar.

My Bast's power is far greater

than your Hermit Purple's!

Woman, my flames will roast you!

Something's pulling me!
My whole body's being pulled!

Wh-What is this?!

I control flames that can melt steel,

but I can't defend myself from this...

My body is being crushed!

I can't keep this up!

Joseph Joestar, since this is the end, I'll tell you...

You were quite amazing.

We've only known each other for a few minutes,

but you are witty and canny,

and your experience gives you the
good judgment that young people lack.

You've got very charming looks, too.

Our ages are quite far apart, but I
might not have minded being with you.

Th-That's great...

Would you mind saving me, then?

Hmm...

You're a lot more powerful than my Hermit Purple!

I can't hold on much longer...
P-Please. Stop the magnetism!

Well...

Nah, I don't think so.

You're nowhere near as charming as Lord DIO.

I-Is there nothing that will convince
you to stop the magnetism?

No, not happening.
Sorry, but you have to die.

Even though I'm begging you?

You're much too persistent, you fool.

Then you've lost, young lady.

What?!

Sh-Shi—

Crash

We told you this was a pincer attack!

Magnets are attracted to each other.

Once you were between us, your luck ran out.

She can't hear you, Mr. Joestar.
It looks like she's passed out.

She's been crushed by the
weight and magnetic force.

I'm sure she's broken more than a few bones.

Now, then... Shall we go get some breakfast?

Certainly. I'm rather hungry
after all that running around.

It's already 9:00 AM.

Yeah. Good grief.

Come on, Iggy.

So am I.

Now, little boy. Come with me to the

Well done.

I'll apply some ointment.

Here you are, ma'am.

Your bourbon whiskey and soda on the rocks.

Enjoy.

Oh, it looks so good.

Gulp, gulp, gulp.

My, you drank that down so quickly
this early in the morning.

It's fine.

My husband's on a business trip
and won't be home for a week.

Now, have some cake.

Why, thank you. Don't mind if I do.

Kids are so innocent.

It's almost 9:00 AM...

The old man and Avdol are pretty late.

They might have encountered an enemy.

Maybe we should go look for them.

Yeah. Good grief.

Come on, Iggy.

I know, I know. You're hungry, right?

So am I.

Hey, where are you going?

Damn it, you stupid mutt.

Let's go.

Hey!

Let me play with you guys, too.

You're too picky, so no.

Don't be like tha—

Ow...

Menacing

You didn't cry, little boy.

Very good. Are you hurt?

How old are you, little boy?

Four, eh? Hmm...

Very good. What's your daddy doing right now?

Working.

So your daddy's away at work? Very good.

How about your mommy?

She's at home doing laundry.

Very good.

So you're here playing by yourself?

Yeah...

Then I guess I can smack you
for getting mud on my pants!

Are you going to pay for this?

How many years am I supposed to wait

for you to be able to work and pay this off?

You stupid little brat.

Mommy!

Hmph.

Mariah is fighting with Joestar and Avdol.

I, Alessi, shall kill Jotaro and Polnareff.

They are strong!

So I'll win using any
underhanded method possible.

Very good, me.

This man's name is Alessi.

His Stand suggests the god
of storms and violence, Set.

He has a habit of saying, "Very good."

Polnareff, don't let your guard down.

Who do you think you're talking to?

Mr. Joestar and Avdol aren't here.

It doesn't look like anything happened, either.

Old man. Avdol. Are you here?

Jotaro.

I'm starting to get suspicious.

Yeah.

That looks so good.

Give me a bite.

Okay, sure.

Huh?!

My kebab sandwich! Wait! G-Give it back!

You thieving dog!

A pincer attack?

You still don't get it.

You think you've cornered me,
but it's you two who are cornered.

You'll burn to a crisp!

Magician's Red!

Hermit Purple!

Avdol can defend himself
with his flames, just barely,

but you have no chance, Joestar.

My Bast's power is far greater
than your Hermit Purple's!

Menacing

Stare

U-Um... U-Uh... I dropped some change...

Where can it be...

Hey... Why are you following us
around, glaring at us all the while?

I sense murderous intent in you.

Huh?

W-Were you talking to me?

Wh-What are you talking about?

I got these eyes from my parents.
They can't be murderous...

I found the coin I dropped.

Oh? Then I guess I'll just have to find out

if you're a Stand user or not...

Myself!

Th-That was close...

So you are a Stand user!

Zuwooo

You're running?!

Hey, Jotaro! There's an enemy!

An enemy appeared!

Polnareff...

Where are you, Polnareff?

Jotaro, over here!

Come back here, you!

Wait!

What the hell?! He's fast!
Why the hell is he so fast?!

He got so far already...

Huh? My voice... Whoa!

Ow!

Wh-What? My shoes... They're huge!

Hey, that's dangerous.

If you run around in the road like that,
you'll get hit by a car.

Good thing I wasn't a car.

Shut up, you dumbass!

Who do you think you are? You bigmouth!

Move, you moron! I'm running after someone!

What the hell are you doing?! W-Wait, what?!

What?! I'm super-high up!

Th-This guy lifted me up with one hand!

How tall is this guy?!

His face and hands are huge!

Hey, watch your mouth, brat!

I'll show you what happens
when you disrespect adults.

Look at your baggy clothes.
Were you trying to be an adult?

Talk about a snotty-looking little brat...

Y-You bastard...

What? What the hell?!

Move it, kid! You're in the way!

Wh-What is going on?!

It's like everyone walking by has gotten huge!

What?!

Wh-Wh-What?

I'm a kid?!

Th-This is really me... I've turned into a kid!

Set

Alessi

C-Could this really be...

Is this kid really...

Me?! I-I-I'm a kid!

I turned into a kid!

You're kidding! No way! No way!

Th-That guy's Stand...

That creepy guy's shadow-like Stand...

When his shadow touched mine,
he used his power on me.

Wh-What the hell?

Damn it, this isn't good.
This isn't good at all!

Jo—

Jo...

Jo... n-no, Jay, Jackie, J-J...

Wh-What was his name? I can't remember!

He'd be able to help me... S-So why?

Why can't I remember?!

Hey, kid. Did you see a French guy pass by?

He's about this tall, and he's
got a similar hairstyle to yours.

Th-That's me! Me! Me!

Good grief... Asking a kid was a mistake.

W-Wait!

Menacing

When your body becomes a child's,
that means your mind

will eventually become a child's, as well.

Your memory will begin
reverting to your childhood.

I'm going to forget things
I knew when I was an adult?

It's true... It's already fading...

Has the time come?

I love picking on the weak!

Very good, me!

Whoa, there! I'm not letting you get away, brat.

I can't say this too loudly,

but picking on the weak makes me feel really good.

I can't help but think I'm
pretty messed up, honestly.

But you know what they say...

If you think you're weird,
that means you're not really weird.

So I'm not weird, right?

I know I won't lose to some kid, either.

Mister guy whose name I don't know, hel—

So you see, my mission is to dispose of you.

I'm stuck! It won't come off!

Sadly...

I don't have time to pick on you.

That's Silver Chariot, huh?

Well, I guess it's possible for you
to use the Stand you had as a child.

But...

Th-That Chariot...! Even Chariot is a kid!

Pami! Pami!

A-And he's super weak! His sword's even bent!

Since you've been turned back
into a child by my Stand, Set,

your mental power has reverted to a child's, as well.

That is, your Stand has also reverted to childhood.

Just like your days as an undeveloped child.

Do you understand?

Apparently you do. Very good.

Still, even if it's weak,
you can still use your Stand.

So I'm afraid I must kill you with my own Stand.

Die, Polnareff!

You're mine!

Oh, no!

It snapped!

Huh?

S-Serves you right! I meant to do that!

Ow! Ow! It hurts!

Are you okay, little boy?

H-He's gone!

That guy runs away as soon
as there's another adult around.

It saved me this time,
but it's still pretty scary.

Wait, little boy.

You're hurt! What happened?

Huh? Uh... Um, uh...

What are you mumbling about?

Huh?!

We have to treat your wounds.
I'll fix you up at my house. Come on.

I-I guess I'll go.

I've got to find that guy and beat him,
or I won't turn back into an adult!

He won't attack when adults are around,

so that's when I have to
figure out how to defeat him.

Come on, now.

Whoa...

Oh, right.

You're hurt. Here, grab on.

She smells nice...

It hurts!

D-Damn it!

Like hell I'm gonna keep quiet
after a kid makes a fool of me.

For my pride as an adult,
I'll beat him to death!

Th-That guy... He doesn't seem
to be coming after me.

All right, little boy.

Come to the bathroom with me,
and take your clothes off.

Huh?!

You're covered in dirt.
I'll wash and treat your wounds.

What are you just standing there for?

Oh, all right.

I'll take them off for you.
Here, raise your leg.

This isn't... This isn't...

What's wrong?

N-Nothing.

No, it's something!

It's definitely something!

I don't understand why, but it feels like
this should be really embarrassing...

And, and, and...

It's so small!

For some reason,
this makes me so sad. Boo-hoo!

Now, grab onto my body.

We'll have to get all that dirt off.

Lift up your leg.

Huh?

I-I-I-I'm so happy! Seriously?
Seriously, is this really okay?!

Is it okay? Of course. If we don't,
you're going to get an infection.

Oh, your wee-wee's got dirt on it, too.

I... I feel like something really fun is happening,

but I'm a kid, so I can't tell what!

All right, be a good boy, okay?

Okay!

You little shit...

I'll cut you in half, then tear you to pieces!

What are you smirking for?

All right. Let's wash your hair.

Huh? No! No, no, no, no, no...

I hate shampoo!

It burns my eyes! I hate it!

Rock, paper...

Scissors.

Monkey, monkey, monkey...

Monkey do, monkey do...

Agh! I lost!

Now, sit down.

Does it sting?

Yeah, it stings.

Can you wash it by yourself, then?

Uh-huh, I can.

Oh? Very good.

Menacing

Bam

Let me say it again.

Very good!

N-No way!

Since I'm a kid, my arms aren't long enough!

Episode 33  Set's Alessi, Part 2

If my arms were long enough,
I could poke his eyes out and run!

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

He pulled the plug, huh? Damn!

But...

If I do this, it'll take longer for the tub to drain

so you'll able to breathe.

About five to ten minutes, perhaps?

You must be in despair!

I'll put an end to you right now.

This is what it means to be
utterly helpless, Polnareff.

Ploop

Wh-What is this?

This shape... This color! It can't be...

You didn't!

A-An adult would never be
shameless enough to do this!

This smell... It is!

Gross! You actually did that!

I couldn't use my arms or legs,

but I still let one out! So there!

H-How dare you?!

D-Don't you have any
decency as a human being?!

A main character would never
even think about doing that!

That's not good at all! Not at all!

Where's the lady?

What did you do with the lady?

Where is she?!

Lady! Where are you? Lady!

Lady!

Menacing

What do you think I did?

Whoa, there!

We should both watch our step, Polnareff.

We might accidentally
step on her and kill her.

What?

I-It can't be...

Th-This is... You can't be serious...

L-Lady...

Anyone who touches my Stand,

Set's shadow, will grow younger and younger.

Polnareff, you noticed the
attack in an instant and managed

to jump away, so you ended
up about seven or eight years old.

But she was in contact with it
for a number of seconds,

so she reverted to a fetus.

She's alive for now,

but since she's not in her mother's
womb, she will indeed die.

She's going through this because
she tried to take care of you.

How stupid.

Y-You scum!

C-Crap! I just...

Whoa!

You touched it again!

You're going to grow younger again.

I'd say you're going to be around
four years old this time, Polnareff.

Crap!

I-I have to...

I have to hurry up and beat him,
or the lady will...

At this rate, the lady will
die in a matter of minutes.

I have to do something to beat
that old creeper as soon as I can!

She treated my wounds
and was so nice to me...

I have to...

I have to do something, fast!

Come on! Come on!

Come on! Come on! Come on!

Why are you running around
cradling that dying fetus?

I'll just do the same to you!

C-Crap! I just touched the shadow again!

M-My body's shrinking...

Yahoo!

Yes! Now I've achieved total victory!

Polnareff! You must be
about three years old now.

Your mind will soon revert
to a three-years-old's, too.

Locking the door won't do any good!

Damn it! The bars are too close together.

Even if I'm a kid...

I won't be able to get out through the window.

Damn it!

I-I can't cut them...

Looks like your precious Chariot's
about three years old now, too.

He can't cut through the bars,

and he's so slow!

I'm coming in now!

Lick, lick, lick, lickity-lick!

I'm coming in, Polnareff.

Silence

H-He's not here?

What?

He's not here! That little punk...

Did he manage to somehow squeeze
through these bars and go outside?

Whoa, that was close!

That bastard Polnareff is trying to trick me.

He wanted me to think
that he got through the bars,

but he's probably hiding somewhere
nearby, waiting to get the drop on me.

Not bad.

Very impressive for a brat, in fact.

Where are you hiding...

At his small size, he could
probably fit in that drawer.

He's probably hiding in
the bucket or the drawer...

No, he could even be in the stuffed animal.

Which one are you in?
I've got a one-in-three chance.

I'll try to get it on my first guess.

I'll smash this axe into
your brain on my first try!

That stuffed animal looks the most suspicious!

Or that's just what I want you to think,

and then I go for the clock
that I hadn't mentioned yet!

I-I was wrong!

Then...

The simple choice! Let's go for the bucket!

Huh?

So it is the stuffed animal!

Th-Th-The drawer, then!

H-He's not here!

He's not here! Not here! Not here! Not here!

Not here! Not here! Not here!

I-Impossible! He's not here!

H-How... It can't be!

The walls and ceiling are made of stone.

Even if they were one centimeter thick,
that Chariot couldn't dig through.

And I know he wouldn't be
able to make it through the bars.

Impossible! Where is he? Where did he go?

You're going to lose to a kid in a battle of wits?

Gulp!

Old Man Alessi.

Even if he's only two,

Not good! Not good at all!

H-Hey, wait!

Pami!

I'll keep attacking with my Stand
until he gets too young to use!

Not good! Not good at all!

Not good at all!

That asshole! He escaped out the window!

Not good! Not good at all!

Doom

Jotaro!

Crap! He's going to kill me!

It's Jotaro! Why's he here?!

It's not very normal to come
falling out a window all bloody.

Calm down... Calm down, me.

At times like this, the one who stays calm wins.

Jotaro must be looking for an adult Polnareff,

and doesn't know about me.

I'll just play dumb like I usually do...

And then attack!

Ah!

Ah! The owner of this house
is going to be so mad at me!

I was cleaning the window and slipped!

What am I going to do?
What am I going to do?

He's going to be so mad!

Hold it, you shitty old man!

Ah!

Mister...

Who were you again?
Who were you...? Um, um...

Now! I was waiting for
Polnareff to show his face!

You're wide open, Jotaro!

Duwaaah

Ah! Don't touch his shadow!

Yes! I touched it! I touched Jotaro's shadow!

Crap!

Jotaro! You've fallen under my Set's spell, too!

Th-This... Wha—

Th-This is..

O-Oh, no!

That guy's going to turn into a kid, too!

Jotaro!

I heard that you only recently learned
to use your Stand, Star Platinum.

Which means you weren't able
to use your Stand as a child!

You're just going to turn into a normal kid!

He's becoming so small!

He turned into a seven-year-old!

I've won! Lord DIO, I will
be the one who kills Jotaro!

You're going to pay me royally for this!

Die, Jotaro!

Whoa! He punched him!
With his little kid fist!

Good grief.

Don't underestimate me just because I'm a kid.

E-Even as a child, when Jotaro's serious...

...he's really serious! He's so strong...

Mumble, mumble, mumble... Huh?

Bam

Not good enough. Time to make
doubly sure he's finished!

Very good!

Was that all a dream?

That boy was wearing this...

It really happened.

For some reason, my body couldn't move...

That's right! I couldn't move
a muscle, but I remember.

That boy was trying his best to protect me...

He was fighting an adult man.

Where did that very brave and manly boy go?

Where did my little knight go?

Where are you? Where did you go?

She was such a nice and wonderful lady.

She was so genuinely kind.

That was close...

I turned back to normal,
but I wonder if she's okay.

Um, pardon me...

Did you happen to see a
little boy leave my house?

He has silver hair, just like you.

Pardon me for asking, but have we met before?

N-No... I-I didn't see any kid.

L-Let's go, Jotaro.

Come on, hurry up.

Ah...

W-Wait!

Could you be...

That earring...

We've never met before.

There's no way we could have.

The two of us are travelers.

This is the first time I've been here,
and I already have to get going

to the next town.

So it must have been a dream after all.

Don't say anything, Jotaro.

Not one word.

Oh! Jotaro and Polnareff!

Where have you two been?

Ah, Mr. Joestar and Avdol!

I told you two not to wander off on your own.

Look who's talking!
You're the ones who disappeared!

Now, now. Let's go get something to eat.

Iggy! Where the hell were you?

Silver Chariot

Jean Pierre Polnareff

Let me clear that away for you.

Thanks.

Finally, we can relax a little.

What should have been
our breakfast became lunch.

Yeah...

We're almost to Cairo.

We've got to figure out where DIO is hiding.

Oh, a spirit photo!

Will it show up?

I'm not sure. But we've gotten close,
so it should be quite accurate.

All right, here we go!

Wham

Sir, is something the matter?

Nothing. Just go back over there.

Y-Yes, sir...

Well, old man? Can you see anything?

Just a little longer.

Almost done...

Almost done...

There!

This is the place we have to find!

Bam

You're the one who fell for the scam.

You can go home if you're scared.

"Which creature walks on
four legs in the morning,

two legs in the afternoon,
and three legs in the evening?"

The guardian of the pyramids,
the Sphinx, asked travelers this riddle.

The answer is "Humans."

Legend says that those who could
not answer were eaten by the Sphinx.

Thirty thousand kilometers from Japan,

Jotaro and the others have finally reached Cairo.

Cairo is immense.

Rather than searching aimlessly,

we should work our way from
the outskirts inward to the center.

We're finally here.

Jotaro and the others have arrived in Cairo.

But before the pyramid named DIO,

a few more Sphinxes stood in their way.

Welcome, foreigners. What would you like?

There's something I'd like to ask you.

We're looking for the building in this picture.

Do you know where it is?

Joseph and the others were exhausted.

Ever since their arrival,

they had searched constantly
for the building in the picture.

These are spirit pictures that

Joseph managed to take of DIO's mansion.

DIO had moved to a new hideout,

and the Speedwagon Foundation
had lost track of his whereabouts.

Where is DIO?

If they are unable to find
him in the next few days,

Holly's life will come to an end.

Sirs, this is a café. Please order something.

Four iced teas.

Nope, I don't recognize it.

Cairo has a population of six million.

There must be two to three million buildings.

Will we be able to find him?

There has to be someone...

Someone has to know where it is.

This building, huh?

I can't tell from just a picture...

Sorry, it doesn't look familiar.

I see. Sorry to bother you.

No problem.

Come on. Let's continue our investigation.

I know that building.

What?!

No doubt about it. It's that building.

Episode 34  D'Arby the Gambler, Part 1

W-Was it you who just said that?

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

I just heard someone say
they know this building.

Yes.

I did indeed say that I know where
the mansion in that picture is located.

What? Really?!

That's great to hear!

Yes! We're pretty lucky to have
found someone who knows

where it is just from this picture.

Where? Please tell us! Where is it?

Are you asking me to give
you the answer for free?

Y-You've got a point. Sorry about that.

I'll pay you ten pounds.

So, where is it?

I love gambling.

I'm a sucker for cheap thrills.

I can't get enough of them.

Well, you could say that
I make my living gambling.

Do you like gambling?

I'm not sure what you're getting at.

If you don't like gambling, just say so.

I'm asking you exactly what you mean by that.

Well... Would you make a
silly little wager with me?

If you win, I'll tell you
where that place is for free.

Wager? I'm pretty confident
when it comes to wagers,

but we don't have time
to play poker right now.

I'll give you another twenty pounds,
so please just tell us.

The thing about gambling is,
you can do it with anything.

It won't take any time at all.

For example,

look over there. See that cat?

Now, why don't we bet on which
smoked fish that cat will eat first?

Right or left?

How about it? It's silly, but thrilling.

Hey! You're really starting to annoy me!

Just take the thirty pounds,
and hurry up and tell us!

Polnareff, that's not the way to
ask someone for information.

Okay, fine! Then I'll make a bet.

I pick the one on the right!

Good! Now it's getting fun.

Then I shall wager on the left.

Hey, now...

Hey, Jotaro. Isn't he rather suspicious?

Yeah... He might be an enemy Stand user.

But he might just be a compulsive gambler.

If he does anything even remotely strange,
plow through him with Star Platinum.

Got it.

By the way, if I lose,
what am I supposed to pay you?

Like, a hundred pounds?

I don't need money.

How about your soul? I'll take your soul.

What?

What kind of joke is that? Cocky bastard.

I want to hurry up and
get the hell away from him.

Your answer?

Yeah, okay, sure. That's fine.

Oh? The cat has taken
notice of the smoked fish.

The right.

The kitty's going to the right.

If I were a cat, I'd pick the bigger one.

The one on the right looks bigger!

You saw it.

It first took the left,
then the right, and then ran.

I win.

Hey, you lost, Polnareff.
What are you going to do now?

I'm getting sick of asking
around about that building.

Now, then. As per our agreement,
let's have you pay up.

Huh? Pay? Pay what?

Your soul.

That is indeed what you just wagered.

Your soul!

I am a Stand user that steals souls!

Gambling makes it easier for the
human soul to leave its vessel.

It is my Stand's power to
steal it at that moment!

What?! What's going on?!

Grab

Polnareff!

Hold it! Don't kill me. It's too late!

If I die, Polnareff's soul, which is
in my Stand's grasp, will also die.

Polnareff!

H-Hey!

H-He has no pulse.

He's dead! Polnareff is dead!

Polnareff!

This is Polnareff's soul.

This means I've already gotten rid of one

of the people trying to get in Lord DIO's way.

Even if he was just a fool.

It's a little overdue,
but allow me to introduce myself.

My name is D'Arby.

D-A-R-B-Y. There's an apostrophe after the D.

The Stand that steals souls
from those who lost a bet...

The one that suggests Osiris.

By the way, this is my cat.

Y-You bastard!

Don't screw with us! A bet? It was just a scam!

A scam?

Listen. If you've been scammed,

the one who failed to see through it is the loser.

I believe gambling is just like relationships.

It's all about fooling the other.

The one who cries loses.

Are you going to kill me with your bare hands?

Very well. Do it.

If you want this soul to die, as well.

Listen here.

You will not walk away from this in one piece.

Do you remember what you
were doing on the night of

September 22nd, 1984 at 11:15 PM?

What are you talking about?

I remember.

Around that time in California,

I was gambling with an American
man named Stephen Moor,

and he said the same thing you just did.

This is him.

The one below is Moor's father,
and his wife is right next to him.

If you want to get Polnareff's soul back,
you have no choice but to continue

gambling with me.

Th-This man is a demon...

He's planning to take us, one by one.

What will you do?

If you're scared, you can go home...

And leave Polnareff behind.

Well, have a drink and think
about it long and hard.

How about some chocolate?

M-Mr. Joestar, what are you trying to do?

Have you heard of surface tension, Barbie?

It's D'Arby. My name is D'Arby.

It's the force that's keeping that drink
from breaking the surface, correct?

What do you plan to do?

The rules are simple.

We'll take turns putting coins in this glass.

The one who makes it overflow loses.

Hey, old man...

Y-You can't mean... Mr. Joestar!

I'll wager my soul on it!

Osiris

D'Arby Elder

I'll wager my soul on it!

Good!

What?!

Impossible! P-Please don't! He's a con artist!

I won't let him cheat!

I'm the one who chose the method of this wager!

Jotaro, make sure he doesn't cheat.

Okay! That's fine. I shall take this bet.

But first...

Do you mind if I inspect the glass and coins?

Of course, you have that right.

You also have the right to
make sure I'm not cheating.

First, will you guarantee that if you lose,

you will return Polnareff's
soul, no matter what?

I am a gambler. I do have my pride.

If I lose, I always pay up.
I won't lose, though.

Very well. You can go first. Put in a coin.

Mr. Joestar!

Just leave this to me.

I'm an expert at this trick with a glass and coins.

I'm not easy to beat when
surface tension is involved.

It should fit about eight or nine more coins...

As long as I can remain calm
and my fingers don't shake.

May I put in more than one coin at a time?

If you can do it all at once.

Well, then...

F-Five?!

Hey, I think I saw a little wave there.

Quiet!

Don't touch the table.

It's your turn.

Your guts are quite impressive,
to put in five at once.

I'll go with one.

That was too close.

The old man...

He has cotton between his finger and the coin.

Liquid is dripping from it.

He's squeezing it out and adding to the alcohol.

And you wanted me to watch for cheating?

You scoundrel...

Not bad.

No more will fit!

Even one more and the
drink will spill over! I've won!

It's not a scam if you're not caught!
That's what he said himself.

This is bad for my heart.
I thought it was going to spill...

Now it's your turn, Obie.

It's D'Arby. Don't mistake that again!

My name is D'Arby!

It's not Obie or Barbie!

My apologies.

He's screwing up his name on
purpose to make him agitated.

That old man...

He's a gambler at heart.

Let's continue our wager.

It's your turn to put in a coin, D'Arby.

There's a shadow, so this angle is difficult.

I'll put it in from the right side of the table.

You may put it in from wherever you like.

Though because of my cheat,
it's already at its limit.

He can't put any more in,
no matter what he tries.

It'll overflow if he even touches the surface.

You're thinking that this glass's
surface tension is at it's limit.

That it's impossible, right?

But that's not true...

I-Impossible! It can't be!

There's no way it wouldn't overflow!

What do you mean,
there's no way it wouldn't overflow?

As you can see, it went in.

He made no suspicious moves
that could've been cheating.

I was watching with Star Platinum.

He put the coin in fairly.

There's no doubt about it.

B-But I made sure!

I made sure that it would
overflow if one more was added!

Why? There's no way one
more could have gone in!

So how?!

Go ahead, Mr. Joestar.

Hurry it up.

Or are you trying to wait until it evaporates?

I-I can't believe it.

Mr. Joestar!

Joestar acknowledged in his mind
that he'd already lost the bet!

That's why his soul emerged.

I, D'Arby, have won this bet!

Polnareff, I'm sorry.

Holly, I might not be
able to save you, after all.

Mr. Joestar!

Old man!

That's two!

Now, then. Let us continue gambling.

As long as you two don't abandon

these two and run away with your
tails between your legs, that is.

You bastard!

You don't learn, do you?

If you kill me, these two souls will die, as well.

Damn it!

Avdol, stop!

Hey! If you're going to make trouble,
I'll have to ask you to leave!

Shut it. Stay out of this.

Yes, sir!

You realized it too late, Jotaro.

Is there something wrong with the glass?

This is how one more coin went in.

There was a tiny bit of chocolate
on the bottom of the glass's outside.

Before they started the game,

he asked to inspect the glass and coins,
and that's when he stuck it on.

I believe you were aware that

if it's not discovered in time,
you can't call it cheating.

Wh-What do you mean?

How is a bit of chocolate
the reason the coin fit?

It's melted now,

but until a moment ago, it was
solid at the bottom of the glass.

He used just enough so we wouldn't notice,

This side will spill
Glass is tilted

but the glass was propped up so it would tilt.

Once it melted, the surface became level.

Surface tension becomes equal
It melts

Even though the surface tension was at its limit,

he made it so at least one more coin would fit.

Wh-What?!

B-But...

Could chocolate actually melt
with such convenient timing?

He melted it using the sun's heat.

I didn't notice.

He went to the right side of the table

so the sun's rays would directly hit
the glass and melt the chocolate.

Fine.

D'Arby, get your trump card ready.

We'll finish this with poker.

J-Jotaro!

Rumble

How interesting!

Poker is one of the games I'm best at!

Poker? This man just beat Mr. Joestar!

I-It's too dangerous!

I know.

He's not violent,

but he's still more dangerous than
any other Stand user we've met so far.

But...

I can't afford not to do this.

Next Episode Preview

Draw three.

I'll draw two.

He's not doing anything suspicious, and yet...

Cheating is all about finding a mental blind spot.

There's only one joker.

Well, then, Jotaro...

Very well. I'll wager my soul.

is permitted only to its intended audience. Unauthorized reproduction, screening,
display, or modification of this program's content is strictly prohibited
by law, and violation is grounds for criminal and civil prosecution.

Before we get started,
there's something I want to try.

Shuffle those cards.

They're shuffled.

What now?

It doesn't matter which one,

but pick a card from anywhere
near the deck's top and flip it.

Only show yourself the card.

Okay, I've looked.

I'll tell you which card it is: the six of hearts.

I'll name the cards in order from the top.

Five of spades, queen of diamonds,
jack of spades, ace of hearts...

Seven of diamonds, six of clubs,
king of clubs, two of diamonds.

That's correct!

But D'Arby's the one who shuffled...

How did you...?

I can name all of the cards,
in order, from top to bottom.

My Star Platinum was able to see the order
of the cards as they were being shuffled.

That's very interesting.

But that just means I have to make sure
you don't see me shuffling the cards.

Don't you get it?

This means you won't be able to cheat.

I just wanted to let you know that.

Good.

Episode 35  D'Arby the Gambler, Part 2

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

The security seal.

An unbroken security seal

means that no one has ever touched these cards.

There's one joker.

I don't see anything unusual.

They're ordinary playing cards.

I'm at 538...

540... No, 556 pages.

I'm at my best again today.

I can figure out which page
I'm on just by the feel.

Jotaro's Star Platinum may
indeed have impressive eyes.

But I, D'Arby, can memorize by touch.

Even when I shuffle the cards,
I know exactly where each is going.

Okay! Open the game!

Ten of hearts.

Seven of clubs.

Looks like I'm the dealer.

I'd better shuffle at an angle
Star Platinum can't see them from.

Cut, if you please.

And now, I shall deal.

To Jotaro, to me, to Jotaro, to me...

Wh-What?! What happened?!

Jotaro, his finger!

Star Platinum just broke D'Arby's
finger out of the blue!

I told you.

I won't let you get away with cheating.

What? Cheating? When?
He was just dealing the cards...

He didn't make any suspicious moves.

No. Take a good look at
the cards in his left hand.

The second card is sticking out...

That's the card he just tried to give me.

He made it look like he was
dealing in order from the top,

but he was actually trying to give
me the second card from the top.

That means...

The card on top would have gone to him.

He would've had three tens with that card.

This technique is called second dealing.

It takes advantage of the assumption
that the cards are dealt from the top.

Instead, this advanced technique
deals the second card from the top.

When done by the nimble
fingers of a professional,

it's impossible for the human eye to keep up.

And in addition, D'Arby is a man who
can memorize the position of every card.

Wh-What a horrible man. Breaking my finger...

No, I'm being forgiving.
I could've just cut your finger off.

Good grief. I can't trust you to shuffle the cards.

Let's have someone who's not playing deal.

Let's ask the boy on top of that hill.

Good.

Avdol, could you bring him here?

All right.

Impressive...

To cheat, one must take advantage
of psychological blind spots.

You need more than sharp eyes
to see through cheating.

It seems I underestimated you, since you saw

through my second dealing.

I shall accept what happened to
my finger as punishment for that.

And now, I shall dedicate all I have
to playing this game with you, Jotaro.

This is my biggest game since May 17th, 1986.

At that time, I won eight properties

from a Japanese man named
Shozo Mayama, along with his soul.

He was a rich man, and a very strong man.

You see, I'm not facing you for Lord DIO's sake.

I'm facing you because I'm a born gambler.

Wh-What are you planning to do with
Mr. Joestar and Polnareff's souls?!

Slash Slash Slash

I have split their souls into six chips each.

In poker, if you believe that your
cards are no match for your opponent's,

you're allowed to fold.

But you must ante up some chips
to participate in each hand,

so two will not be enough.

When you're able to collect all six chips,

you'll have acquired one complete soul.

Understood?

Now then, Jotaro. I'd like to give
you some chips to bet, as well,

but I haven't heard you say a certain line yet.

Fine. I'll bet my soul.

Good!

Jotaro...

The chips that are as white
as snow represent your soul.

Once I take six of those from you,

you will lose your soul.

Osiris

D'Arby Elder

I will use one of Polnareff's
chips as my opening ante.

Let us begin!

In poker, each player is dealt five cards.

Players may discard cards for new ones
one time in hopes of strengthening the hand.

But once gambling is involved,

it becomes a complex psychological game.

Now, I shall discard two cards.

Jotaro, your soul is represented
by a mere six chips.

Make sure you consider your moves carefully.

Boy, you don't need to
understand what's going on.

Don't worry about a thing.
Just shuffle and deal the cards normally.

O-Okay...

I'll take three cards.

My, my. What a frightening expression.

You must have a very good hand.

Maybe I should play it safe
and bet just one Polnareff.

Call.

If neither one folds, they'll need
at least three chips per hand.

All right! It's game time, Jotaro!

Two pair, nines over eights.

I'm so sorry.

Two pair, queens over jacks.

That was close. I almost lost.

So then...

H-He's only got three chips left.

J-Jotaro...

Next hand. Deal.

It might not just be the next hand, but your last.

I'll draw one card.

What's the matter, Jotaro?

Hurry and look at your cards,
and decide whether

you'll bet or fold.

Jotaro?

I'll...

keep my cards as they are.

What?!

Ah, forgive me, but...

What did you say?

Did I hear you wrong?

I thought I heard you say that
you would keep your cards.

You heard right. I'm keeping my cards.

I'll play with these five cards.

I understand that!

I'm asking if you intend

to play those cards without looking at them.

These cards are fine.

You can't be serious! Answer me!

How can you play cards you haven't even seen?!

By the way, Avdol, I have a request.

A request?

R-Right. Of course, but why
aren't you looking at your cards?

I told you to answer me, Jotaro!

In addition to my last three chips...

I'll wager Avdol's soul.

Wh—

What?!

D'Arby, you're a calm man.
Every move you make is calculated.

You may not be powerful,
but you are truly strong.

I am not a man suited to gambling,
as I easily become emotional.

If I played you, I would most likely lose.

But I believe in Jotaro.

I'm not sure what his unseen cards mean,

but if Jotaro has asked me to wager,
I shall do so in total faith.

Even if that wager is for my soul.

Well, this is...

You've both been overwhelmed by excitement.
You aren't thinking straight.

Boy!

I said I was changing one card. Hurry it up.

O-Okay...

Mr. D'Arby, I did just as you said.

I gave this Japanese guy useless
cards that won't amount to anything.

My skill never fails.

You will win. There's no doubt about it.

Jotaro, I'm sure you thought you picked
a boy who had nothing to do with this,

but not only are all of the people in the
café working for me, so is everyone in view.

That includes the owner and those men, too.

No matter who deals, I can't fail!

As I commanded, Jotaro's cards are worthless.

Since he made the abnormally bold
decision not to look at his cards,

I had to panic for a moment...

But it's a bluff! How dare
he try bluffing against me?

Does he actually think I'll fold? What a fool...

Hmph. Very well.

In addition to your three,
I'll call with all six of Polnareff's chips.

But on top of that...

I shall raise you all six of Joestar's chips.

That brings the total to fifteen.

What?

Wh-What?! Hold on a minute!

Jotaro doesn't have any more chips to wager!

What are you talking about? Of course he does.

What do you mean?

Well, for proof, I'll need you to write this down.

Then my Stand will be able to work.

What are you talking about?

You have the soul of Kakyoin,
who's still in the hospital.

What?!

Now, time to be frightened!
You're going to lose even more confidence!

I'll see your cool facade crumble
right before my eyes!

How dare you try to bluff me, D'Arby?

I won't be satisfied until I see

your poker face collapse
into terror when you lose!

Fine.

I shall wager Kakyoin's soul, too.

J-Jotaro!

Y-You're wagering the soul
of a man who isn't even here!

Is that going too far?

Hey, Jotaro! What did you just do?!

What did I do? What are you talking about?

You just lit a cig—

Is something the matter?
Are you not feeling well?

Th-This little...

His confidence! He couldn't possibly...

Could he have used Star Platinum to
switch the cards while I wasn't looking?

Menacing

I, Jotaro Kujo,
will wager my friend Noriaki Kakyoin's soul,
and offer it if I lose.
—Jotaro Kujo

Menacing

I, Jotaro Kujo,
will wager my friend Noriaki Kakyoin's soul,
and offer it if I lose.
—Jotaro Kujo

Menacing

S-Stupid brat!

Don't cast that worried look in my direction!

If they find out you're working for me, I'll kill you!

You fool! Damn it!

I have four kings in my hand.

The only hands stronger than that
are four aces, a straight flush,

Four Aces

Straight Flush

and five aces, using the joker.

Five of a Kind

If Jotaro, who didn't even look at his cards,
got any of those hands,

it could only happen after
replacing all five cards.

No matter how fast Star Platinum may be,

could he have possibly switched out not only one,

but all five cards without me noticing?

Of course not! There's no chance in hell!

There's no way he could have switched

all five cards under the eyes
of the undefeated D'Arby!

All right, Jotaro! Let's do this!

How dare you try to bluff with that cigarette?!

Y-You've got a drink?! When did you...

Y-You bastard! How dare you underestimate me?!

Very well, let us do this!

My cards are—

Hold it.

I still have the right to raise.

What?!

R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-Raise?!
You don't have anything left to wage—

I raise you my mother's soul.

What?!

You mother?! Jotaro, Ms. Holly's soul...

Bang

I came to Egypt to save my mother.

So if I wager her soul, she won't complain.

But, D'Arby, you'll have to
match my mother's soul.

For that...

I'll have you tell me the secret of DIO's Stand!

His demeanor...

He must know the secret of DIO's Stand.

But traitors will be killed.

If he speaks,

it means that D'Arby's life is good as over.

Jotaro... If you're that confident,

you must be sure to win, right?

I can believe that, right?

Your cards are that strong, right, Jotaro?!

Well? Do you bet or not?

Let's hear you say it loud and clear, D'Arby!

I'll say it!

I'll say it, damn it!

I'll say it!

I'm the greatest gambler in the world!

I'll take this bet! I'll call!

Call, call, call, call, call,
call, call, call, call, call...

I'm going to call!

Ca—

C— C— Ca— C— C-C-C—

I-I can't! I'm terrified! I can't speak!

I'm so scared, I c-c-can't speak!

C-C-C-C...

I-I can't... I can't breathe...

C-C-C-C-Ca—

Ca—

This guy... H-He passed out!

He's standing, but he's unconscious!

He got so nervous, he passed out.

Mr. Joestar and Polnareff's souls
are coming back! We're saved!

He gave up on the wager in his heart.

He admitted defeat, so their souls were released.

F-Four of a kind!

H-His hand was a four-of-a-kind with kings!

J-Jotaro, what in the world was your hand?

I-I knew it...

Woozy

All of the cards I dealt him were worthless!

Even Star Platinum wouldn't be
able to cheat someone like D'Arby.

I managed to scare him so much, he folded,

but with such a worthless hand...

Good grief. If I had known,
I would have freaked out.

F-Freaked out?

Jotaro, you wagered all
that on worthless cards?!

It appears his collection has
been freed to cross over, as well.

Come on, everyone! Let's all play mahjong!

Backgammon is a lot of fun, too,
and dice games are thrilling.

Though I'll beat you all!

Osiris's D'Arby: Retired

Osiris's D'Arby has retired.

I don't think we'll be able to
get DIO's secret out of him now.

Yeah. But he was a strong enemy.

He almost beat all four of us by
himself. He's really something.

Yes, he was truly terrifying.

I'm not sure what's going on, but yeah.

We didn't get to look good at all this time.

Damn, it's dark. My eyes won't adjust.

Where the hell did he go?

It's midday, but it's been such a pain in the ass

trying to find him in here.

I think DIO was in that room over there...

Wh-What's that? DIO's leftovers?

None of these women resisted.

They happily let him drink up all their blood.

I'll never understand what they're thinking.

I guess he's charming as the Devil himself.

And while I'm at it, where did he get

all these treasures and art pieces from?

I guess there's nothing he can't do.

Did you

want something?

L-Lord DIO!

D-Damn it.

J-Just standing in front of
him sends chills up my spine.

Calm down, Hol Horse.

Don't let him overwhelm you.

He's nothing. He's only a little
stronger than me, maybe...

I asked you what you're doing here, Hol Horse.

Ah, uh, w-well... I-I came to give my report.

It appears that the fifth and sixth of the

Nine Gods, Mariah and Alessi,
have both been defeated.

And?

A-And that was my report.

Joestar and the others will
arrive in Cairo tomorrow.

Only three of the Nine Gods remain.

When I said, "And?"

I was talking about you, Hol Horse.

Huh?!

When are you going to fight
them for me, Hol Horse?

You swore loyalty to me,
but you haven't really fought at all.

Anyone can give me reports.

You failed me twice,

and came running back here.

My body, from the neck down, once belonged
to a man named Jonathan Joestar.

He was Joseph Joestar's grandfather.

Look at these two fingers.

See how the left side is slower to heal?

The left side of this body is weak.

That proves this body isn't yet completely mine.

That I'm not immortal yet.

So I am not yet prepared to face them.

I expect you to kill Joestar
and the others for me this time.

Otherwise, I'll kill you.

Y-You've got to be shitting me!

Is he trying to drive me into a corner?

"For me"?

Don't you mock me.

I just side with whoever's strongest.

I didn't swear loyalty to you
from the bottom of my heart.

I'm not gonna sell you my soul.

Damn it! Are you even all that strong?

Your back is wide open!

Maybe your body isn't moving
the way you want it to yet...

C-Come to think of it, instead of
fighting the four guys in Joestar's party...

He's alone right now.

It'd be quicker and easier to
blow his head to smithereens

right here and now.

Then all that treasure will be mine.

He's totally open!

I'm pointing the Emperor's barrel right
at him, and he hasn't even noticed.

I can finish him off now.

Just gotta pull the trigger...

It'll be over in an instant.

The Emperor was made for
killing at point blank range!

I can do this. I absolutely can!

What are you doing? Hurry up and get going.

I'll kill you!

I'll leave your brains all
over the floor, Mister DIO!

Are you really trying to shoot me?

H-He's gone.

I like you.

At the moment you tried to kill me,

you weren't sweating,
and your breathing was even.

You were absolutely calm.
As I'd expect from Hol Horse.

I-I couldn't see him move.

And even at that...

He didn't tear through any of these spider webs.

There's no way he could have gotten behind me!

It wasn't speed.

How?! How did he get behind me?

I don't understand.

Was that DIO's Stand, The World?

You're not ready to fight them? Bullshit!

I-I finally understand, Lord DIO,

that I have no choice but to follow you.

I-I've lost completely...

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

Episode 36  Hol Horse and Mondatta, Part 1

Ladies and gentlemen, we hope you
enjoyed your flight from Aswan.

Our plane will momentarily land on
schedule at Cairo International Airport.

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

Whoops! Sorry 'bout that.

Looks like we got to this taxi first.

See ya.

What? Got a problem, dumbass?

H-How horrible...

Take me to the Mena House hotel in Giza.

I'm going to open up the trunk,

so don't let the sudden light hurt your eyes.

Got it?

Huh? Did you just say something, sir?

I wasn't talking to you.

Shut up and keep your eyes on the road.

Y-Yes, sir.

Mondatta, I had no choice but to drag you

onto the plane since you wouldn't cooperate.

Don't be a baby, Mondatta.

Since he got blown up by a bomb,

your brother's stuck in the
hospital for another month.

You're going to team up with me now.

With your book of premonitions
and my assassin's gun together,

we're going to kill Joestar's group.

Got it, Mondatta?

I know that you're an introvert
who won't trust anyone

besides your brother, Zenyatta.

But don't you want to avenge your brother?

Do you want to grow up a coward, Mondatta?

I'm doing my best, too!

We've got to fight!

Get your revenge, Mondatta!

I'm going to untie you now.

Can you promise you won't cry or scream?

All right. Good boy.

Don't work yourself up. You'll get sick.

I'm on your side. Don't worry.

Just relax.

Sir?! Wha— Are you throwing up?!

Shut up!

Oh... You were airsick?

Anyway, l-let's be pals, Mondatta.

I'm Mondatta. This is Hol Horse.

He's super mean and a total jerk!

While I was sleeping, he tied me
up and stuffed me in a trunk,

and took me away from my brother Zenyatta.

It's so sad!

But even though I'm scared,
in order to avenge my brother,

I worked up my courage and
paired up with Hol Horse.

So even though you're too
scared to get close to me,

you're trying to be brave in your own way.

Is it really true that your Stand's
predictions are always right?

I trusted the rumors and
decided to team up with you,

but your brother's failure worries me a bit.

Answer me! They're absolute, right?!

A new comic appeared on the blank page...

While Hol Horse and I

were walking along the outskirts of Cairo,

we met a very pretty lady.

Fabam!

Suddenly, he jump kicked her!

After being kicked, the lady was so happy,

she gave Hol Horse some jewels.

Hooray!

Yay! We're rich!

What is this?!

You've got to be kidding me!

You call this a prediction, Mondatta?!

It's insane! There's no way this could happen!

M-M-M-My... My Th-Thoth's
comic book predictions

a-a-a-are absolute!

Yes, 100%.

100%?! Stop messing with me, kid!

What kind of woman would be
so happy about getting kicked

in the neck that she'd give me jewels?

Menacing

Listen, Mondatta.

When it comes to women,
no one's a nicer guy than me.

I have girlfriends all over the world.

I may lie to women, but I've never hit one!

It doesn't matter to me if she's ugly
or beautiful. I respect women.

This prediction will not come true.

Because I swear, I would never hit a woman.

And even if someone paid me
a ton of money, I'd never kick one.

I-It's 100%, yes.

See? Your prediction was wrong!

Who the hell are you?!

This is... There was a scorpion
inside my lady's collar!

And it's a highly venomous species!

What?

You saw the scorpion

before it could crawl into my clothes.

If he hadn't crushed it,
you would have been stung...

You saved my life.
Please, allow me to thank you.

How about my necklace?

Please take it.

We're invincible!

Mondatta, and I, Hol Horse,
are an invincible duo!

Thoth

Mondatta

The building in this picture, huh?

I've been repairing roofs in Cairo for forty years,

but I've never seen this place.

But judging from the look of the building,

it must have been built over a hundred years ago.

That means you should

find it eventually if you look south of here.

The further south you go in Cairo,
the older the buildings are.

Huh...

Sorry I couldn't be much help.

No, thanks a lot. Sorry to bother you.

Okay. I understand. Thank you.

I called Japan...

My daughter's condition has worsened.

She has no strength left.

She'll only last three or four more days.

I can feel it.

DIO is near here.

I can feel him hiding somewhere around here.

He's definitely close.

Let's go.

If we keep asking around, we'll find him.

Yes, let's go. We'll keep asking.

We meet again, you familiar faces...

Or something like that.

To think they've gotten so
close to Lord DIO's mansion...

They're almost there.

By the way...

Mondatta!

About your new prediction...
I really can't believe it.

There's no way something that
ridiculous could actually happen!

M-M-M-My, my—

Your predictions are 100% accurate, right?

Th-They are, yes.

Damn it! Are you telling me to believe this?

You can't be serious.

Ta-da!

"I've finally found you...
Joestar, Jotaro, Polnareff, and Avdol!

Damn it! They're getting closer
and closer to Lord DIO's mansion.

You fools. I'm just going to
shoot you in the face right now!"

Grudge Grudge
...thought Hol Horse, resentfully.

Run Run

"I'll avenge my brother!"

...I thought, angrily.

But, Hol Horse, you shouldn't even think

about using the Emperor in the marketplace.

Now, Hol Horse, stick your fingers
up Polnareff's nose, and then...

Jam

Yay! Everyone is bleeding and out cold!

Lucky you, Hol Horse!
This is your chance to kill them all!

Like hell I'm gonna believe that!

You call this a prediction?

Stick my fingers up Polnareff's nose?!

What the hell?! Well, Mondatta?!

I get that it's a chance to kill them all,
but it's absolutely ludicrous.

Listen. Even if that happened,
I'd have to get close enough

to a strong guy like Polnareff to
stick my fingers up his nose.

Wouldn't it be much faster if I
just shot him with my Emperor?

Y-You won't be able to f-fire a bullet, yes.

E-Even if you try to shoot,
fate will make you follow the comic, yes.

Y-You must believe, yes.

I-If you try to go against
what's drawn in the comics,

you will only suffer.

I-It is fate, yes. It is 100% accurate, yes.

But your brother failed.

M-My brother was trying to save himself

and transformed into Jotaro without thinking, yes.

If he had trusted the comic and not transformed,

then the real Jotaro would've blown up, yes.

The predictions are not wrong, yes.

What to do...

P-Polnareff is gone.

Hey, where's Polnareff?

He disappeared all of a sudden.

Shit! It can't be...

Don't move!

Or I'll put a hole in you.

P-Polnareff...

Idiot! Don't try anything funny.

Keep your hands where I can see them.

I thought I saw someone
stalking us like a hyena,

and if it isn't a visit from my
old friend, Mr. Hol Horse.

Still haven't learned your lesson?
Still trying to kill us?

You took real good care of us in India.

You're lucky Avdol's alive,

or I would have killed you
the second I saw you here.

Are you alone, Hol Horse?

Nah, you wouldn't be here alone.

I'm sure you've got someone nearby.

Well? Am I right?

Damn it!

At least he doesn't seem to
have noticed Mondatta yet.

I still have a chance...

Your hand's showing! Your damn fingers!

You're not scary on your own,

but you have a talent for
discovering other people's talents.

Once you team up with someone who has talent,

you become terrifyingly strong.

So where's the Stand user
you've partnered up with?

Menacing

Your fingers...

Tuck your fingers in, Mondatta.

If he finds you, we're finished!

B-Believe!

You got hit because
you tried to use your gun.

Believe in destiny.

Th-Then our victory will be absolute, yes.

Hey, what's under that box?
Someone's in there!

Hey, Polnareff, did you
find the guy following us?

Gah! That's Avdol's voice! H-He's coming!

Believe, yes!

Believe, and somehow stick your
fingers up Polnareff's nose, yes!

S-Seriously?! Damn it...

I'll do it! I just have to do it, right?

Whoever's under there, get out!

Now's my chance!
He's looking the other way!

I know you're hiding under there!

What the?!

Yes!

Yay! Everyone is bleeding and out cold!

Lucky you, Hol Horse!
This is your chance to kill them all!

So, when the hell is this chance coming?

What am I supposed to do now?

Ache

What the hell are you doing, Hol Horse?

I'd like to know myself!

What the hell am I supposed to do after this?

What am I supposed to follow up with?

What's the matter, Polnareff?

He's not responding.

That's odd.

Sh-Shit! Th-The other three are coming this way!

Damn it!

How am I supposed to make it
like the prediction from here?

What the hell am I supposed to do?!

Next Episode Preview

Damn it! I've been cornered!

It's a sign for you to look behind me!

Looks like there was a car accident over there.

I made tea, so have some lunch.

Once I stuck my fingers up his nose,
the prediction came true.

My premonitions are absolute.
It is fate, yes.

up Polnareff's nose, and then...

Polnareff, did you find the guy following us?

Answer us.

Avdol and the others are c-coming.

This is bad... Very bad!

Chario—

Whoa, now!

Crap...

Y-Yes! I'm faster.

Don't move. I'll shoot!

Hey, can you hear me, Polnareff?

Hey, Polnareff!

Oh, there you are.

What's the matter?

Was someone following us, after all?

E-Er...

Damn it! I've been cornered.

What was this about me getting

this lucky chance to beat them

if I stuck my fingers up Polnareff's nose?!

This situation is the exact opposite!

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

Stardust Crusaders

Episode 37  Hol Horse and Mondatta, Part 2

Is something the matter, Polnareff?

No...

If Avdol were to find me now, I'd be killed!

I feel like crying.

If I'd known this was going to happen, I would've

just used my gun in the first place.

Mondatta, that bastard.

If nothing else, my gun was faster
than Polnareff's sword just now.

Damn it!

Polnareff?

Hurry up and get them to leave!

If they do find me,
I can at least kill you, Polnareff.

N-No one was following us.

It was just my imagination.

I see...

By the way, what are you doing in that corner?

Tell them you were about to take a piss. A piss!

W-Well, you know... I needed to take a piss.

What?

Seriously, you were taking a piss?

That's an embarrassing thing
to do in the middle of a city.

Damn bastard, jabbing that gun into my head...

I know! I'll send them a signal.

Come on, guys. Figure it out.

Lick

Lick

Lick

Look where my tongue is pointing!

It's a sign for you to look behind me! Behind me!

Behind me, damn it! Behind me!

Why are they being so quiet?

A-Anyway, that's what's up.
You guys can go on ahead.

All right.

That was a lie!

A lie! Don't go!

Look at my tongue. Behind me!

Behind me, damn it! Figure it out!

Is something wrong?

Why are you making that face?

Does your tongue hurt?

No, I think he's saying something's behind—

Idiot! Don't say it!

You don't mean...

P-Polnareff!

Did you give them...

some kind of signal?!

Damn it! I'm pissed off now!

I'll... I'll kill you!

Die!

What?!

Huh?

Hey, he's...

Wh-What? You're kidding me! He sneezed?!

It's Hol Horse. Be careful!

There's someone under that box, too!

You can't be serious. This is impossible.

Sticking my fingers up his nose made him sneeze!

Damn it! If he hadn't sneezed,

I could have at least killed Polnareff.

I should have never teamed
up with you, Mondatta!

I'm going to be killed!

I failed thanks to your prediction, damn it!

I'm doomed.

B-Bro, look! That one guy is over there.

That's him, all right.

He's the bastard who blew my ear
off outta nowhere at the airport.

I'll run him over!

What?!

Crash

Th-This is...

It was so sudden, even they
couldn't get their Stands

out in time to avoid the truck...

I stuck my fingers up his nose,
and the prediction came true.

I can't believe it. All four of them at once...

It is fate, yes.

My premonitions are absolute.

But it's too early to finish them off.

We must see what the next prediction says, yes.

Okay!

Emperor

Hol Horse

Crash

"Yay! The chance to kill them has arrived!

But be careful.

We should hide and see how things go."

"It's still too soon to get close to them.

The other three have passed out,
but Jotaro's still awake.

Dash

He's standing up!"

So Jotaro dodged the truck just a second before.

That was close.

If I had carelessly closed in,
he would've countered.

He's looking for me.

He must be wondering why I disappeared
without finishing them off.

You want to beat them, don't you, Mondatta?

After all we've been through,

we've got to win, no matter what.

Right, Mondatta?

Yeah...

We're just one step away from victory.

So Mondatta, what do we have
to do to finish them off?

Your comic's predictions are 100% absolute.

I believe them.

I'll do whatever they tell me to.

If it's sticking my fingers up something, I'll do it.

If I have to eat shit, I'll do it in a heartbeat.

I want to win!

Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-There it is!

I-It has finally appeared, yes.

Th-The final prediction!

What?

Bam

Now, Hol Horse's next attack will be the climax!

Hol Horse found some guys
working on sewage pipes.

He paid them so they'd
open up a section of the pipes.

If Hol Horse fires all of his bullets
into that pipe at noon sharp...

Bang Bang

Hey, looks like there was a
car accident around the corner.

Just leave it. Let's hurry up and finish this job.

Hold this pipe for a sec.

Okay.

Menacing

Menacing

Wh-What's going to happen if I fire into that pipe?

Hurry up and turn the page!

What's going to happen when I
shoot my bullets into that pipe?

The bullets will come shooting out of the pipe.

Boom! Hol Horse's bullets shot through his brain!

Right smack in the middle of his forehead!

Y-Yay!

It finally appeared, yes.

I was waiting for this, yes.

I was waiting for this prediction, yes.

This is amazing!

Boom

I-It's amazing, but hang on!

We'll be in trouble if we interpret it wrong.

L-Look at this page from earlier.

Kabam

This is the prediction that appeared
before your brother got blown up.

This is what happened to your brother!

Th-That's because my brother
had the ability to transform,

and transformed without thinking, yes.

But y-you and I cannot transform, yes.

That's... That's right! I can't transform!

I won't even attempt to act like Jotaro.

Wh-Which means...

Th-That's correct, yes.

I'll be able to avenge my brother, yes.

There is no mistake in this prediction, yes.
Bang Bang

If you shoot your bullets into
this pipe, Jotaro will die, yes.

Bam

But wait.

It mentions a specific time.

At noon sharp?

Wait, noon sharp?!

There's only two minutes left until noon!

D-Don't panic. Y-You just have
to shoot into the pipe, yes.

You have plenty of time, yes.

It is fate. It will happen.

I-I know. It's 100%!

I believe... I believe, but...

Since there's a specific time...

It's making me panic!

H-Hey, you guys! Listen up.

Take a section of this pipe off.

Hurry up!

Hey, who do you think you're talking to?

Who the hell do you think you are?

I'll kill you! Hurry up and open it!

M-Mr. Hol Horse, ordinary people
cannot see your Stand, yes.

And the comics say to pay them, yes.

What? Pay?

I only have a minute and ten seconds left!

I'll pay!

A-A-All right! Sorry! I'll pay you, so open it!

Please! I beg of you!

Pay us? What a weirdo.

You'll pay us just for opening it?

Okay, then, sure. Hurry up and pay us.

R-Right...

Hey, what's the problem?

I don't have any money!

Th-That's right! I forgot it at the hotel.

What the hell?

M-Mondatta...

I gave you a coin purse just
in case you got lost, didn't I?

Give it to me. Hurry!

R-Right.

There's only forty seconds left. Hurry!

I-It's mostly coins, but...
Here's the coin purse.

Hey, I saw one fly over there into the shadows.

It's just change, but there's quite a bit.
How much is there?

At least twenty pounds!
Hey, you're stepping on one.

Oh, you're right.

Pick it up later! You can have it all!

Everyone, it's coming up noon.

I've poured some tea,

so why don't you take a lunch break?

Oh, good idea.

Damn you, old woman!
This comes first! Butt out!

Thanks, ma'am.

Grarr

God damn it! I said to hurry up and open it!

Or I'll split your heads open with this rock!

I-It's open.

Out of the way!

Die, Jotaro!

I did it! I shot into it at noon sharp,
just like in the prediction!

Go!

Wake up, old man.

I-I'm mostly all right...

I, too, am merely scratched.

More importantly, Polnareff is...

Someone get this damn block off of me.

We won!

Jotaro's face is right in front of the pipe!

What?!

Hey, man.

Sorry, Jotaro.

I don't know what the hell
Hol Horse was thinking,

but he stuck his fingers right up my nose.

How disgusting.

It still itches. Sorry.

M-My bullets...

They missed!

Mondatta! Wh-What the hell is going on?!

What the hell?!

I-I do not know, yes.

M-My premonitions are absolute! It is fate!

I can't believe it!

My premonitions have never
ever been wrong, yes!

Look! Jotaro and the others are alive.

None of my bullets hit them!

It's totally different from the prediction!

You little...

Please tune in again tomorrow.

And now for the news at noon...

Huh?

Huh?!

What?! It's noon now?

M-My watch... My watch...

It's fast!

Wh-Which means I shot my bullets before noon.

It's noon right now!

What the hell is going to happen?

What's going to happen next?!

I-It can't be...

According to this prediction, the bullets

I shot were supposed to hit Jotaro dead-on.

The direction...

Boom
What the hell is going to happen next?!

Bam

Hey, I heard screaming around that corner.

I don't know what's going on, but it's not good.

After what happened with the truck,

it'll make trouble for us if the cops show up.

Let's get out of here.

What the hell happened to Hol Horse, anyway?

I don't know.

He disappeared for some reason.

Hey, it's dangerous to hang
around that pipe, Jotaro.

It's spraying filthy water.

Is he dead?

No, just in critical condition.

I have no idea what happened, though.

It looks like a bullet went through his
forehead and out the top of his head.

One centimeter down,
and he would have been dead.

Talk about a lucky man.

My prediction wasn't wrong.

And... this was Hol Horse's fate.

But that Jotaro...

How lucky can he be?

My brother and Hol Horse lost against fate.

The only one who could face
someone so lucky is Lord DIO.

Zenyatta... Looking at Hol Horse,

I'm starting to think revenge is really stupid.

Let's just forget about Jotaro and his friends.

If we use my Stand's predictions
not for attacking others,

but for our happiness and
to help people in trouble...

People would love us,

and I bet more good luck would come our way.

I'm sick of spending my life cowering
under a box, afraid of everyone.

This fight has forced me to grow.

I'm going back, Brother.

To Aswan, to where you are.

S-Sorry. I kicked it without thinking.

I didn't mean to hit you.

Forgive me.

Wait, th-this dog...

Swell
I've seen it before, but where?

Th-This dog! It couldn't be...

No!

Hey, by the way, where'd that dumbass dog go?

Iggy?

I'm sure he's eating something
off the street somewhere.

I told you that he'd be useless.

If it were that easy to change your
personality and grow as a person,

no one would ever suffer.

Mondatta became even
more depressed than before,

and was admitted to the
hospital with Hol Horse.

Ba-dum-tss!

Iggy hates being with others.

I was looking for you
because I have a request.

No doubt about it. It's this mansion.

By the way, where'd Iggy go?

Good grief. I can't let a kid who likes dogs die.

The building in this picture, huh?

I've been repairing roofs in Cairo for forty years,

but I've never seen this place.

My daughter's condition has worsened.

She'll only last three or four more days.

I can feel it.

DIO is near here.

Let's go.

If we keep asking around, we'll find him.

Man, it's super hot today.

I haven't had a bath since yesterday.

My good looks are going to waste.

What the hell, man?!

Do you want something from me?

How dense are you?!

I'm telling you to get out of my way!

You're a foreigner.
Don't sit here like you're a beggar!

Who the hell gave you permission?

Ah, are you a needy foreigner?

This isn't much, but here you go.

Hey, this is...

Y-You bastard! How dare you?!

Th-This is my territory, damn it!

Territory?

Hey, Polnareff!

Don't sit there.

And give that money to him.

Is this guy a beggar?

Sorry. My friend doesn't
know much about this city.

You should have just said so in the first place.

I'm a beggar who can't speak in
public for professional reasons.

This city has a beggars' association.

Each beggar has an established territory

where he's paid to sit and do his work.

That may seem strange,
but without rules like this,

there'd be chaos in the streets.

Huh...

Even worse, you hurt my pride!

I wonder if I'd earn more if I
dressed up like a needy foreigner...

Maybe I'll start doing that.

By the way, I thought you looked familiar.

Aren't you Avdol, the fortune teller?

I heard that someone was trying
to kill you, so you fled to Japan.

I've been looking for you

to ask a favor, since you hear
much and remember it well.

I'll pay well.

We need to find the location shown in this picture,

and we're in a bit of a hurry.

Fwoosh

I'm done with work for the day.

I can find the place from
that picture in three hours.

Wait right there.

Hey... Where did Iggy go, anyway?

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

Episode 38  The Guardian of Hell, Pet Shop, Part 1

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

Menacing

There's no doubt about it.

That's the mansion.

I found it in two hours.

There's nothing in this city that I can't find.

Huh?

Crash

Iggy then thought to himself...

That bird is a Stand user like me.

A Stand of ice dropped that thing.

And he's protecting this mansion.

He eliminates those who try to enter it.

Wh-Which means that bird

will come after me next!

Since ancient times,
the Egyptians had been hunting

using falcons that would glide
through the Nile Valley.

The falcon was called Horus,

and was highly regarded as the
guardian deity of the royal family.

Its eye, which can spot small
animals several kilometers away,

is called the Eye of Horus.

The Eye of Horus is a design
symbolizing fortune and glory.

His name is Pet Shop.

His Stand suggests the
god of the heavens, Horus.

Iggy thought to himself...

I-It appears that I've stumbled upon

the mansion Joestar and the others
want to find, where that guy DIO lives.

And...

It was that Stand's power that
dropped that chunk of ice.

So he's not a guard dog, but a guard bird.

Menacing

Y-You've got to be kidding me.

I've got nothing to do with this DIO guy.

I was dragged to Egypt against my will

and ended up traveling with
Joestar's gang. That's all!

Like hell I'm going to fight!

I just want to live comfortably,

fall in love with a hot bitch,
and live a peaceful, carefree life.

Like hell I'm going to do something as
dangerous as fighting this violent jerk

when I'm not gonna get anything out of it!

I'm just gonna act like a dumb mutt

so he'll think I've got nothing to do with this.

Those eyes...

I can't tell what that bird's
thinking from his eyes.

I don't think I'd lose to him in a Stand battle,

but I've worked hard to act like an idiot.

I've got nothing to do with this!

Hurry up and go back to
the mansion, you birdbrain.

Oh, it's a bird.

What's with that bird?
I-It's not even trying to dodge!

I-I can't stop in time!

I-I'm gonna run it over!

Wh-What was with that bird?

I-It was able to go under the car,
despite how low it is?

A bird that didn't even try to flee,

but actually charged toward the car...

Wh-What a crazy bastard...

Anyway, it looks like he's lost interest in me.

He only attacks if you try to enter the mansion.

If Joestar and the others actually find this place,

they'll have a hell of a time trying to get in.

Well, it's not my problem.

Chibi! Buchi!

Chibi! Buchi! Where are you?

Hey, have you seen my two dogs?

Their names are Chibi and Buchi.

Shut up! Don't ask me, I'm a dog.

It's not like I can talk. Are you stupid?

Th-That collar...

This is Chibi's collar!

Why is Chibi's collar under the gate?

And there's blood on it!

Chibi and Buchi...

Does he mean those two big dogs from earlier?

Chibi! Buchi!

Hey, you're not...

You're not trying to get
under that gate, are you?

You'll be killed!

Chibi! Buchi! Are you here?

Chibi! Buchi!

Chibi! Buchi!

This isn't my problem.

I don't care if some human kid dies.

Survival of the fittest is the law of nature.

Buchi! Chibi!

Idiots die. The careless die.

I'm don't want any trouble.

See ya!

Chibi! Buchi! Where are you?

Come back!

Bam

He's eating them! No!

Good grief.

I can't just stand by and
let a boy who likes dogs

get killed!

Bang

Horus

Pet Shop

Chibi! Buchi!

Damn it! I guess I'm gonna have to fight.

Stare

It seems this is the first time that

Pet Shop realized Iggy
was a Stand user like himself.

You birdbrain! Come at me! I'll kill you!

The average speed of a falcon's descent
is over 300 kilometers per hour.

There is no organism that can move faster.

A falcon rips out its prey's vital organs

with its razor-sharp black talons while hunting.

Even traveling at 300 kilometers per hour,

it can still pinpoint its prey's vital organs.

What? Did he just smile?

It looked like the corners of its
rigid beak just edged up a little!

A smiling bird?

Wh-What is this?

Something's not right...

The air's gotten awfully cold...

I-Ice is coming out of the ground!

C-Crap!

My feet got stuck to the ground
while I was busy looking up!

My Stand's feet are also rooted by the ice...

Crap!

Icicles?!

But seriously, Avdol...

Do you think that sunglasses guy
can really find DIO's mansion?

If he can't find it,

then no one else can.

He understands the complex geography
of Cairo better than anyone else.

Believe in him and wait.

You say that, but...

We looked around for three
days and couldn't find it.

It's hard for me to believe that
he could find it in three hours.

You're getting repetitive, Polnareff.

Honestly. Can't you just calm down a bit?

I know it's hard not to feel anxious,

but all we can do now is rely on the
knowledge of those who live here.

Jeez. I haven't seen Iggy for a while, either.

Where the hell did that stupid mutt run off to?

Iggy hates being part of any group.

I'm sure he's close. He'll show up eventually.

Aren't dogs supposed to like humans?

What a shitty, cynical little mutt.

I managed to get away from him.

That thing's ice took the
skin right off my paw pads...

Damn it! I should have
just let that human kid die.

That bird's Stand is no joke.

The ice it makes isn't normal.

There's something more to it.

I've got to hurry up and
get the hell out of here.

Talk about holding a grudge!

Iggy has disappeared.

Where did he disappear to?

Damn it...

That ruthless bastard doesn't hold back.

But in the end, he's still just a bird.

This place reeks, but I guess I've gotta deal it.

I'll hide out down here for a while.

Wh-What the hell is this bird?!

Bam

Hey.

Talk about gullible.

What you thought you killed was actually
just The Fool's shapeshifting sand!

All right! You must be pretty
stupid if you fell for that.

Look at all that blood.

You probably shouldn't move around.

I never had any interest in you
or your master DIO, anyway.

Let's just call it a draw.

You got to shoot me up
with those ice missiles, too.

Wh-What the hell?

Do you think you're Bruce Lee or somethin'?

Hey! I said I won't go near
your mansion anymore!

Let's stop this already. Okay?

So that's your Stand's actual design...

He used that thing to freeze
the wound and stop the bleeding!

C-Crap!

H-He blocked the exit with
ice when I wasn't looking!

The ice is coming this way!

Shit!

Ice is running all over the tunnel!

I-I've got to get out of this tunnel!

He blocked this exit, too!

He's planning to finish me off.

Talk about excessive!

This goes way beyond holding a grudge.

He's a machine made to hunt and kill!

Not to mention, if he catches me,
he'll eat me alive!

What?! M-My foot!

I-I can't get my foot out!

Next Episode Preview

Man, this is really not my day!

That stupid dog.

That birdbrain is really pissing me off.

It wouldn't be strange if there was a Stand user

in charge of guarding the mansion.

I'm gonna have to do this...

If I don't, he's going to kill me!

Episode 39  The Guardian
of Hell, Pet Shop, Part 2

Hey, the sun's about to set.

Despite how confident

that beggar sounded about finding DIO's
mansion from the photo within three hours,

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

it looks like he was wrong.

Eh, Avdol?

It's occurred to me that

it might be better if he didn't find it.

It may be

that he did find it,
and that's why he hasn't returned.

Hey...

There could be a Stand user that prevents

people from getting close to the mansion.

It might have been too
dangerous to ask that beggar

to find the mansion for us.

Hey, now...

M-My leg...

My leg...

It got chopped off by that icicle.

If I didn't abandon my leg,
I would have been finished.

I-I should hide here for a while.

I need to hide here and get him off my tail.

I'll have the Speedwagon Foundation
make me an artificial leg.

God damn that birdbrain!

You're not going to get away with this.

I will get you back for this. Damn it!

That noise...

It's the sound of something
diving into the water.

I-It can't be...

It is not impossible for a
bird to dive underwater.

Birds use lungs to breathe,
just like humans and dogs.

But they also have air sacs that store air,

located in five to six places
in their chests and abdomens.

Air Sac                                       Lungs                          Air Sac

Because of these air sacs,

birds are able to fly at an altitude of

six to seven thousand meters,
where humans would fall comatose.

Even if they were being strangled,

because of the supply of
oxygen in their bodies,

birds could survive a few minutes.

This means that a bird can stay
underwater much longer than a dog.

S-Something's coming closer through the water.

That's impossible!

I don't want to believe it,

but the sound heading
straight this way has to be...

It couldn't be!

It can't be!

That asshole bird!

It actually dove into the
water to come after me!

That bastard... Where'd he go?!

I-It's coming! It's coming again!

His ice. One... two... three.

Th-Three shots are coming!

Bash

I deflected them!

Stab

I-I did it. Serves you right!

Th-The water's stopped dripping in...

And the icicle's starting to
freeze over again from the root.

Wh-What the hell?

I-I get it.

He's freezing all of the water

surrounding this area!

The airway's been cut off!

B-But he's not trying to suffocate me.

He's trying to crush me!

It's no use. It's gonna collapse!

This power's ridiculous! I can't hold out!

There's infinite water around
me that he can freeze.

Damn it!

I thought I was hiding in the water,
but instead, I've been cornered!

I-I'm just going to have
to dig my way out.

Man, today is really not my day!

My front leg gets ripped off,
and that damn bird is too strong!

I'm at my limit. I'm going to be crushed.

I have to hurry up and dig a hole to escape.

Huh?

What's that? There's some kind
of hollow space inside...

It's the birdbrain!

Open

He's gonna shoot an ice missile!

Crap! The Fool is behind me!

I don't have time to defend.

There's no way out, either!

I know! I-I'll just have to do this.

If I don't, he'll kill me!

I'll let him crush it

on purpose,

and let the air pressure
launch me forward!

I-I did it. I defeated him.

Stupid birdbrain. Serves you right...

B-But I'm done for.

I've lost a lot of blood,

and I don't have the
strength to swim to shore...

I-I'm gonna drown.

And here I thought I'd live
a life free of trouble...

Damn it,

I messed up...

I can't believe it!

I was just passing by and you
happened to drift by on the river.

That bird got you, didn't it?
Just like he got my dogs...

It's okay.

I don't think that bird's close by.

Don't die! Hang in there!

I'll patch you right up.

The bastard bird, Pet Shop,
and his Stand, Horus: dead.

Bastard Bird
Pet Shop - Stand: Horus -
Dead

Horus

Pet Shop

Damn that Iggy! Where the hell did he go?

He's gotta stop making trouble for us.

I'm worried. We haven't
seen him for quite a while.

That stupid mutt!

What's the matter, Jotaro?

Is someone following us after all?

No... I thought I heard a voice calling for us.

A voice?

I-Iggy?!

Iggy!

What in the world happened?

Iggy's been badly injured!

Hey... He's missing a front leg...

D-Did he get run over by a car?

He's not the kind of dog
that gets into car accidents.

You were attacked by the
enemy, weren't you, Iggy?

But it looks like someone treated his wounds.

And with perfect surgical technique.

It wasn't Iggy's voice.

Someone was calling to us in human language.

It appears that Iggy had
a run-in with the enemy.

I saw a boy holding him as he lay dying.

The one who treated him is a doctor
from the Speedwagon Foundation.

Just like the one

who treated my eyes.

Y-You're...

Kakyoin!

It's Kakyoin! Hey!

Kakyoin, are your eyes okay now?

I'm glad you're all safe.

It's great to see you!

Have your wounds healed?

Yes. I'm fine now.

It left a few scars, but my
vision has completely returned.

That's good to hear.

Jotaro...

Hey, Iggy. Where are you going?

Iggy, who had no interest
in humans or Stands,

is apparently trying to lead us somewhere.

I'm not sure what happened while
he was fighting the enemy's Stand,

but he seems rather angry about
how much pain he endured.

Just where is he trying to lead us?

Hey, Iggy, hold on.

Th-That car...

It's the luxury car that beggar was riding in.

Th-This wreckage is...

What did this? There's a huge hole,
like something gigantic pierced it.

It's just as I feared.

I knew I shouldn't have asked him...

Is this the work of the
Stand user that Iggy fought?

It seems there can be little doubt.

Iggy!

Hey, what is this?

I'm in a cold sweat all of a sudden.

This overwhelmingly oppressive feeling...

Where's Iggy

t-trying to take us?

I already know. This atmosphere is...

This dark sensation...

Th-This mansion is...

The one from the picture.

Who would have thought you'd
be the one to find it, Iggy?

The mansion that stood before Jotaro,

projecting an abnormally sinister energy,

housed the cause of all they've been through,
their destiny: the embodiment of evil.

They had journeyed long
and far to reach this place.

They traveled through many lands,

encountering DIO's countless
Stand-using assassins.

It was, indeed, a series of life-or-death battles
that were no simple task to survive.

Tears, laughter, sadness, rage, and happiness.

They experienced many
emotions on this journey.

In order to save Jotaro's mother, Holly,

it has indeed been nearly fifty
days since they left Japan.

All to defeat DIO, and end
this hundred-year-old destiny.

Joseph thought to himself.

He was determined to reach his goal

and save his daughter Holly, no matter what!

Kakyoin thought to himself.

In order to save Holly, and to conquer
the weakness in his own heart,

they would defeat DIO, no matter what.

Avdol thought to himself.

There was evil this world that must not

be allowed to prosper,
and so, must be destroyed.

Polnareff thought to himself.

He would make DIO pay

for manipulating him with
a flesh bud to make him

act against his own righteousness.

Iggy thought to himself.

The reason he had to endure

all this absurdity was
because of that bastard DIO.

So he was going to pay him
back for it, no matter what.

And...

In other words, if we beat the shit out of DIO

right here and now, it will all be over.

He's here. There's no doubt
about it, this presence is his.

Rumble

He's inside this mansion right now.

Which means that we...

...have finally reached the
last stop on our journey.

Are you ready?

Bam

The gate's open.

We can just walk in.

But it was closed yesterday...

Just as I can sense his presence,
he is aware that I have arrived.

Entering this mansion carelessly

would be like being swallowed by the enemy.

Now...

What to do...

The door opened! Watch out!

Hey, look at this corridor.
I don't see any end to it.

It's not real, is it?

It's some kind of trick or illusion, right?

Polnareff, don't go through that door.

We should see at least one
or two Stand users before DIO.

What the?! Something's coming!

Who the hell's that? Is he a Stand user?

Welcome.

Master Joestar, we have
been awaiting your arrival.

I am the butler of this mansion.

Allow me to wager

that Star Platinum's first
attack against me will...

Jotaro, blast him!

Take that corner at full throttle!

If we don't defeat you,
we won't be able to proceed.

Exactly! That is indeed correct.

I dunno what the hell that is,
but it's no ordinary human!

Polnareff!

But no matter! I'll kill him!

A playing card?

Welcome. Master Joestar,
we have been awaiting your arrival.

I am the butler of this mansion.

My name is D'Arby.

D'Arby?

Yes. I am D'Arby Younger.

I am the younger brother of
D'Arby Elder, whom you have

defeated beyond recovery.

Bam

You're the gambler D'Arby's younger brother?

Are you here to avenge your older brother?

No, not at all. I wouldn't even think of it.

Didn't my brother tell you

that the one who is fooled
and loses the battle is at fault?

I believe that to be true, as well.

It's my brother's fault for losing.

I don't bear a grudge at all.

My brother is my brother, and I am myself.

We are different people.

I am ten years younger than my brother.

I did respect my brother to a certain degree,

but we are from different generations.

My brother is old-fashioned.
He had to cheat and swindle to win.

He could only defeat those who were
either old-fashioned or amateurs.

I believe that Lord DIO also recognized this,

and that is why I am the one
he chose to be his butler.

What is the matter?

If you would like to fight me,

please, come into the mansion.

Everyone, don't rush in there carelessly.

We don't have much time.
Hurry up and take us to DIO.

Jotaro! Be careful! Something's coming out!

D'Arby Younger. His Stand, Atum,

suggests the God Atum.

H-Hey, he brought out his Stand!

Well, that's rare these days.

It's been a while since we faced someone who used their Stand out in the open.

So who is it?

Who shall be my first opponent?

He's so annoying!
Jotaro, beat the crap out of him!

Rumble

Let us make a wager.

The first blow Star Platinum uses against me

will be a left-hand punch.

His first attack will be a punch
thrown with his left arm.

Let us wager.

Whatever! It's all the same if you
hit him with everything you've got!

Do it!

Hurry up and hit him, Jotaro!

Bam

What? H-He dodged?

Such speed!

That's impossible.

Too bad. It seems I have lost this wager.

Just like my brother, I love gambling.

But I'm not very good at it.

As a reward, I shall take
you to an amazing world.

What? A hole...

Curses! It was a trap after all!

Jotaro!

Jotaro's falling into the hole!

Pull him out!

Oh, very well. You gentlemen may enter, too.

Wha—

Mr. Joestar! Kakyoin!

Wait! It would be too dangerous to follow them!

Avdol, can you hear me?

If you don't hear from us in ten minutes,
set the mansion on fire!

Got it, Avdol?!

Mr. Joestar!

Episode 40  D'Arby the Player, Part 1

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

This illusion... Are we
underground or above ground?

This wet feeling... This reality...

It's too convincing.

Just what is he trying to do?

Old man. Kakyoin.
Consider this mystery for me.

His Stand...

It knew without doubt that I was
going to throw a right punch.

Why do you think that is?

If we don't solve that mystery,
this guy will beat us.

Would you like something to drink?

Of course, the drinks are real.
They are also not poisoned.

Is this inside the mansion?

It is.

Where inside the mansion?

I cannot disclose that.

Is it below ground?

It could be.

Is this illusion being created by a Stand?

Yes.

Is this your Stand's power?

It is not.

Is it DIO's?

It is not.

Whose is it?

That information is not necessary.

According to the Speedwagon Foundation's intel,

there are about two or three other Stand users.

Is that true?

That information is not necessary.

Looks like we're not getting any straight answers.

I could lie to you.

But I don't tell lies or trick others,
as my brother did.

So what are you getting at?

If we don't defeat you, we can't proceed?

Exactly!

That is indeed correct.

That needlessly polite attitude...
This man gets on my nerves.

Have you forgotten that it's one against three?

We're in a hurry, so all three of us will attack you.

Now, don't be in such a hurry.

Before that, let's have a look

at my collection, shall we?

Collection?

Though it pales in comparison to my
brother's, I also have a collection.

But one likes to hear compliments
about their precious collection

when showing it to others.

It can't be...

Dolls? Wh-What are these dolls?!

No, Kakyoin.

Given that we're dealing with one

of the D'Arby brothers,
those can't be ordinary dolls.

Squirm

D-D'Arby...

Talk to me. Please, talk to me...

Talk to me!

I'm so lonely...

Help me...

Oh my God!

They're alive! These dolls are alive!

You bastard! They're souls!

My hobby is to make dolls.

And I've had real souls inhabit these dolls.

I'm letting the cat out of the bag,
but this is my Stand's power.

My brother simply enjoyed his
soul coins, collected in little rows.

But that's rather simple and mundane.

I change their clothes and even talk to them.

For example,

her name is Sonia.

D'Arby! Oh, D'Arby!

I love hearing about her beautiful love stories.

D'Arby...

Isn't her skin beautiful?

D'Arby...
She's so beautiful, I'm never
embarrassed to show her off.

Dr. Elliott is a murderer.
He's killed eight people.

I enjoy hearing about the
patients he murdered.

I made his glasses and stethoscope myself.

Oh, that's right! I must show you this!

The video game master from Japan, Tatsuhiko!

His IQ is 190, so he was formidable.

It wasn't easy to beat him and steal his soul.

Mama... Mama! Mama!

Both of you brothers are insane.

No, you're much worse than your brother.

You're pissing me off more!

You act like a gentleman, but you're scum.

You make me sick.

By the way, I'm sure you experienced
this when fighting my brother, but...

Human souls are indeed mysterious.

Once you admit defeat,
your soul's energy drops almost to zero.

I watch for that moment,
and then drag their souls out!

That is how both my
brother and my Stands work.

That's enough talk!
You're just pissing me off.

We'll hurry up and defeat you,
then move forward!

But you must listen!

Jotaro, you know you are
already under my control.

Earlier, Jotaro, when I read whether you were

going to use your left or right,
you were shocked, weren't you?

And how I read it is still a mystery to you.

At that moment, though subtly,
I was able to touch your soul.

What do you think I did when I touched it?

Bam

Wh-What?!

What is that?!

I left Atum's arm attached to your soul.

If I were to crush your right arm,

I'm sure Lord DIO would be quite pleased.

But in that instant, I would be
attacked by Kakyoin and Joestar,

and would be utterly defeated.

I don't want that to happen.

So how about this, gentlemen?

Why don't we play a little game
and wager our souls?

What?

If I admit absolute defeat,
I shall let go of his arm.

Good grief. Already under your control, huh?

True... But you're going to
regret tricking me, D'Arby.

I would absolutely love to hear you say,

"I will play a game and wager my soul."

But the first to play will be...

Kakyoin. I choose you.

Hey, what's the meaning of this?

You should fight me first.

You and Joestar are related by blood,

but you have no relation to Kakyoin.

If, after I steal the two Joestar souls,

Kakyoin lost interest in wagering his soul

and attacked me with his Stand,
it would be troublesome for me.

You're so full of yourself.

You seem to think you've already won.

Very well. I shall be your first opponent.

What?

Kakyoin!

It's fine. I feel confident.

I have experience with video games myself.

I'd like to challenge you to F-Mega.

And I shall wager my soul!

Atum

D'Arby Younger

I shall wager my soul!

Good.

Kakyoin!

You don't have to go first.

Yes, I do.

Since you have that thing attached to your arm,

it's likely you'd mess up the game's controls.

D'Arby, where is our guarantee

that if you lose, your Stand
will let go of Jotaro's arm?

Menacing

There's nothing wrong with the TV,
console, or game cartridges.

These are the same video games
you could find anywhere else.

I am not like my brother. I shall not cheat.

Now, let's begin.

Yes.

F-Mega!

Select your car.

First, please select your car.

Right.

So your machine is #28, eh?

Mine is #15, because I was born on January 5th.

Are you ready?

Enough pleasantries. Just go!

Race start in...

Five!

Th-The way he's pushing the accel button over

and over again at such a fast speed...

He's trying for a start dash!

Three...

Crap! I'm not going to be able to dash like this!

Two...

He's going to get ahead of me!

One.

Start!

He blocked me!

As long as I can keep this up, I will win.

It is impossible to get past me at this point.

And sadly, I, D'Arby, never make
mistakes with controls in a race.

You were naïve, Kakyoin!

What?!

I see you've played this game before, Kakyoin.

I don't need to answer that.

All right!

This is your chance, Kakyoin!

Hurry up! Get your machine
back on the course and start!

That technique...

It's not possible by simply
having experience in F-Mega.

Although he looks rather
anxious on the outside,

he has a very bold personality.

They're tied! They're right next to each other!

No. Kakyoin ended up on the outside.

If they hit a curve side by side,
the outside car is at a disadvantage.

355 kilometers per hour... 358... 360...

Only three seconds to the first corner!

It's possible to take the corner at this speed!

I'm going to bust through
that corner at full throttle!

Two... One!

At the same time!

They turned that corner at the
same speed and at the same time!

They're side by side!

I've taken a liking to you, Kakyoin!

You wagered your soul,
but you're not scared at all!

You rise above fear to work the controls.

Only people like you, who give me competition,

are worthy of being a part of my doll collection.

Noriaki Kakyoin thought to himself...

Me? Rise above fear?

Thanks. I've had training.

Six months ago, when I met your master, DIO...

When he planted the flesh bud in my brain,

I was trained to withstand fear.

That moment...

The moment I encountered DIO, honestly,
I was terrified of the beast he was.

I lost feeling in my legs,
every hair on my body stood on end,

and my body was frozen.

When I saw DIO and realized I couldn't move,

the paralysis made my hairs
stand even more on end.

My stomach convulsed, and I had acid reflux.

I nearly threw up.

As he looked at me, DIO said this to me.

His voice was gentle, as if speaking to a child.

Kakyoin.

There's nothing to fear.

Let's be friends.

I curse myself! After I heard that...

I was relieved. To be honest,

I felt relief from the bottom of my heart.

I thought I could stay alive!

But it was humiliating. I can't forgive myself!

Nothing could be more humiliating.

I couldn't forgive myself.

I cursed myself for giving in to him.

Jotaro saved me, and that was the
reason I went on this journey.

I will never return to being that
pathetic Kakyoin ever again!

D'Arby, that's exactly why I'm wagering
my soul with you in this challenge.

Three, two, one!

Again, at the same time!

The third corner!

That is why I, Noriaki Kakyoin,

will not make any nervous
mistakes with my controls.

I will show you that!

All right! The fifth corner!
Again, at the same time!

They're going through all
of them the same time!

K-Kakyoin... Damn you...

Next is the sixth corner!

Once you're through the sixth corner,
you'll see a speed tunnel.

As soon as you're through the tunnel,

you'll be able to go twice
as fast, up to 850km.

No matter what,
I must go through that tunnel!

But the tunnel is only wide enough
to accommodate one vehicle.

If they continue to race neck-and-neck,

one of them won't be able to enter the tunnel!

The sixth corner! Again, they were together!

The tunnel! I see the tunnel.

Kakyoin, don't let him push you out!

It seems you haven't realized yet, Kakyoin.

Are you trying to push me out?

Take a look at your #28's remaining power.

K-Kakyoin has less!

At the race's start,

you spun and were blown away
by my blocking maneuver.

Didn't you realize you had less energy after that?

Two seconds until the tunnel.

You're going to collide!
Let him have the lead!

Go into the tunnel after D'Arby!

I cannot!

If I let him enter the tunnel first,
my chances of winning are gone.

One second until the tunnel!

Kakyoin!

Grip

Whoa! He tilted his car!

I never guessed you'd enter on the tunnel's wall.

Y-You did it, Kakyoin! Mentally, you're winning!

Keep pushing through!

Shut up! You're distracting me.

He's ramming him!

I don't care how little power I have left.

I'll take this next turn, even if only a
hundredth of a second ahead of Kakyoin,

take the shortest course, even if it's
by a thousandth of a millimeter,

and get through this tunnel
even if it's but a moment faster!

No radar.

H-Hey, what's wrong?
I can't see the machines!

We have to get through the
tunnel in darkness from here.

What?!

Absolute darkness, where the
radar is completely useless!

There are eight curves,
one mine, and one cannon.

At the end of the darkness is the tunnel's exit.

One mistake and you'll hit the wall.

But my body has memorized the
timing needed to take the curves.

So has D'Arby.

That's the sound of taking a corner.

What's going on?! Where are they driving?

Who's going faster?

Three...

Two...

One!

Cannon!

Just for an instant,

I could see them in the
light of the cannon blast!

Kakyoin is just slightly behind.

I can see the exit!
They're coming out of the tunnel!

Gulp!

D'Arby is ahead!

He's ahead by a length!

I have won!

Next Episode Preview

I will never let down my guard.

You have less power than I!

I've grasped his soul!

Don't be ridiculous, Jotaro!

I know the rules of baseball.

It is impossible to back out now!

You should offer encouragement
at times like this.

They're coming out of the tunnel!

Oh! D'Arby is ahead!

He's ahead by a car length!

My speed will be doubled.

I have won!

No!

You have less power left than me, D'Arby!

Which means...

Kakyoin's #28...

spun and knocked D'Arby's car off the course!

And it was going at 850 kilometers per hour!

He's out of the course!

Kakyoin's #28 safely landed.

Yes!

The one with less power goes flying.

It seems you were wrong to think
that losing power wouldn't matter.

You didn't realize that I intentionally
dropped a length behind you,

so I could knock you off the course.

Really?

It's you who didn't realize.

Losing power was all part of my plan.

I lost power on purpose so you'd
push my car off the course!

This battle isn't over yet!

Look at the direction my machine is flying!

What?!

I-It flew over the curve and landed
further ahead on the course!

I-Impossible!

That's right. Normally, it's impossible.

Even at 850 kilometers per hour, once you're
off the course, you crash into the ground.

You could never reach the
next part of the course.

But Kakyoin, if you were to slam into me,
it would become possible.

I just needed you to send me flying!

It was all part of my plan to reduce
my power, then have you hit me.

Now, then...

Shall we continue the race, Kakyoin?

Don't admit defeat, Kakyoin!

Kakyoin!

I now hold his soul in my hands.

He has just admitted defeat.

He admitted within his heart that
it was pointless to continue this race.

But Kakyoin, you are the first
to ever make me sweat like this.

This doll is now an especially
valuable part of my collection.

He is the first opponent to

overcome his fears and not make any mistakes

due to mental weakness.

K-Kakyoin!

I shall treasure it,
and take very good care of it.

Now, now.

I'd like to warn you against
attacking me in retaliation.

No, not just attacking me.

If I were to slip on a banana
peel and hit my head,

or choke on a piece of gum,

or die of a heart attack from the bang
of an inflated popcorn bag being popped,

Kakyoin's soul would pass on
to the realm beyond this life.

Episode 41  D'Arby the Player, Part 2

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

J-Jotaro?

Oh?

Hey, Jotaro! Why are you sitting down?

I'll defeat him! I'm next!

Old man, have you played any one of
these games more than Kakyoin has?

Stay out of this, old man.

This isn't like playing cards or hanafuda.

Next is baseball.

I want you to play this baseball game with me.

I'll wager my soul.

Good. And I shall wager Kakyoin's.

I have retrieved my Stand
Atum's arm from your arm.

Now that I have Kakyoin's soul,

there's no point in holding
on to your arm anymore.

It would put my Stand at a disadvantage

to fight you with only one arm.

Your Star Platinum's movements are
extremely fast and super precise.

But to think that you'd pick this baseball game...

This is the game I'm best at.

D'Arby! As soon as you lose
to Jotaro, I will finish you.

Remember that.

Kaboom
Oh! That's A Baseball!

There is no trickery in this game.

I've confirmed that.

First, please pick your team.

The Jaguars.

Jaguars!

I see.

So you've chosen a team with a strong offense.

Two of your players have
batting averages over .400.

Then I shall choose the Red Dragons.

Red Dragons!

Would you like to bat first
or second? Take your pick.

First.

Very well. The Jaguars are up first.

You can draw your own characters
to input as the players.

This is Star Platinum.

Input. Now, let us play ball!

Jaguars versus Red Dragons.

Play ball!

Top of the 1st

I've chosen #15 to be my pitcher,
since I was born on January 5th.

Here I go.

The pitcher is winding up.

The first pitch!

What?!

Strike!

H-Hey, Jotaro. What did you just do?

You swung the bat before the
ball even left the pitcher's hand!

H-Hey, Jotaro... Why do you
keep taking practice swings?

Don't tell me... Could it be that you...

Have you played this baseball game—No,

have you ever played any video game before?

Answer me, Jotaro!

Whatever. I know the rules for baseball.

I'll figure out the controls as I go.

Wh-What?!

That ridiculous, terribly-timed swing!

The way you're working the controls...

This is your first time playing any game, isn't it?!

Strike two!

This time, you swung the bat
after the ball hit the mitt!

You're a total amateur!

God damn it, Jotaro!

You've never played a
video game before, have you?!

Strike! Batter out!

Stop messing around, Jotaro!

Why are you putting on that attitude?!

You wagered your own soul!
You can't back out now!

Good grief.

You should be supportive at times like this.

"It's just the first inning.
You've only just started.

You can do it, Jotaro." Like that.

What are you thinking?

Even with your Star Platinum's
super precise movements,

did you think you could beat him with
no knowledge of video games at all?

What are you thinking, Jotaro?

What on Earth are you thinking?!

Jotaro...

Let me warn you that if, on the other hand,

this is some plan to trick me
by acting like an amateur,

it's not going to work.

No matter the situation,
I never let down my guard.

Once my opponent has wagered
his soul, even if he is an infant,

I would give my all to defeat him.

Old man.

I'm not thinking about anything.

Except...

about breaking that asshole's nose,

as he sits there so certain that he'll
never lose to anyone in this game.

I'm only seriously thinking about
getting Kakyoin's soul back.

You can say what you'd like...

But it's still the top of the
first inning with one out.

Let us continue the game.

Please don't forget that if one of us

takes an eleven-point lead,
the game will be called.

Second batter, #3.

Strike!

Th-This can't be happening!

This time, the ball was at
least 40 centimeters away

from where he swung the bat!

Strike two!

Not even close!

Strike! Batter out!

It's no use.

The difference in ability is too obvious.

At this rate, it's as if a tea ceremony club,

where nobody's ever held a bat,
decided to challenge a championship team.

It's too pathetic.

Strike!

Strike two!

It seems he truly is an amateur. He's too weak!

I think I now understand how a judo master feels

when he can gauge his opponent's strength simply

from how he puts on his gi.

When it comes to video games,
Jotaro is indeed an amateur.

But I will never let my guard down.

I've memorized the weaknesses of
all the batters in this game.

Next will be a low pitch to the outside.

I'll throw my ultimate screwball and strike
out all three without a single run.

Top of the first, two outs,
two strikes and no balls.

Here comes my next pitch.

Go ahead.

I've pretty much learned how to bat now.

What? What did he just say?

"How to bat"? What?

Did he just say "pretty much learned"?

What is he talking about? What does he mean?!

What?!

Jotaro!

Good. This game is pretty fun.

H-Hey, don't tell me...

It's still going. The ball is still in the air!

What did he say just now?!

"I've pretty much learned how to bat now."

Learned? Did he just say learned?!

I-It's fair!

Y-You're kidding! You're kidding me!

Home run!

Home run! A home run!

Jotaro! You bastard!

Atum

D'Arby Younger

Jotaro!

What did you just say?

"Learned"? "I've pretty much learned
how to bat"? Is that what you said?!

There's no reason for me to say it again.

He was, without a doubt, a beginner.

Is he saying that he managed to learn
the controls by swinging eight times?

Jotaro Kujo has Star Platinum,
who has the power of super precise movement.

Now I know exactly why

Lord DIO sees him as a problem,
and why my brother lost.

Interesting. This is how my opponents should be.

And you exposed this fearsome

characteristic of yours in the top of
the first inning, right after we started...

You'll eventually regret that.

Let us continue the game, Jotaro.

He did it!

It's fair! It's fair!

He got another home run!

Now it's four to nothing in the top of the first.

Looks like you've got the
hang of this game, Jotaro.

Keep this up! Keep it up!

Hey, D'Arby.

I'm sure you don't want to hear this,
but I'll say it as a kindness.

If you return Kakyoin's soul
right now and take us to DIO,

Menacing

we'll spare your life.

My brother was a master at gambling,

and a master at cheating.

Yet he never said to me, "Brother,
why don't we play a game of poker?"

Not even once.

Do you know why that is?

When I was fifteen,
my brother hit on my girlfriend.

I beat the shit out of him,
even though he was ten years older.

I broke his ribs and kicked him
until he vomited blood.

To that, all my brother
had to say was, "I'm sorry."

Do you know why?

What are you getting at, you bastard?

My brother knew ever since we were children
that he had no way of beating me.

He knew there was a reason he couldn't win.

And now, it appears as if Jotaro is getting
excited and really taking off with this game.

However, he's uncertain,
just like my brother was as a child.

He's uncertain about my abilities.

"Nah, it couldn't be. Or wait, maybe..."
That's what he's been thinking.

Right, Jotaro?

What the hell are you talking about?

I'm changing pitchers! I'll switch #15 for #77.

#                Name             G W L H S ERA

#77 is a fastball pitcher, whose fastest pitch clocks in at 165 kilometers per hour.

Number
Right-handed
Pitching Speed: 165km/h
Specialty: Throws fastballs,
but can only throw
straights and forkballs.
Power Level: 4
ERA: 5.23

And I will declare what kind
of pitch he will throw.

#77 will now throw

a forkball straight down the middle.

Rumbling

What?! He just declared his pitch?

He will throw a forkball right down the middle.

Will you believe me or not?

Jotaro, he's just playing mind games with you.

Don't let him declaring a pitch get to you.

Throw, D'Arby.

Will you believe me or not?

Here it comes! It's coming
straight down the middle!

It's a straight!

But is it going to remain a straight?!

Will it fall or not?

He swung! Jotaro bet on the forkball!

But it's not falling! It's staying straight!

He caught the bottom of the ball!

Out!

Top of the first, three outs! Change!

Top of the 1st

How could you be so stupid?!

You actually believed him

and swung for a forkball!

No.

He was certain that I would swing for a forkball,

so he changed it to a straight fastball.

As he said, ever since we entered
this mansion, I've been uncertain.

He somehow knew that Star Platinum
would throw a right punch.

I-Impossible! So are you telling me

that he's reading your mind?

Next is the bottom of the first.
It's my turn on offense.

This is a declaration that I will hit a home run.

I shall hit the ball you throw into the left stands.

Old man. You're certain that the game

and console aren't rigged in any way, right?

There's no chance of that.

And I've been keeping my eye
out for any kind of cheating.

That means the secret lies with his Stand.

It doesn't just take souls.

It has some kind of secret power.

The course of action I'll take is...

This should tell me something.

What?! He's going to try to
hit the batter on purpose?

Where might you be aiming to throw? Inside?

Will it be high?

Or low?

Are you planning some sort of trick?

What?! He dodged at the same
time as the pitch was thrown!

Bazoom

H-He read that! He perfectly read it!

There's no way he could have done
that without reading Jotaro's mind.

Home run!

That's one run.

I-Impossible.

We've met all kinds up until now,

but we've never seen a
Stand that could read minds.

If it can read minds, then will no
amount of intelligence or power

s-stand any chance against it?

Wh-What are you going to do, Jotaro?!

Bottom of the 1st

Bam

Damn it! H-He's declaring another home run.

Will the next one be outside?

And low?

Or will it be a straight?

Clang

Home run!

Four to two.

By analyzing various data
and the situation you're in,

you can figure out how an
opponent's mind works, to an extent.

But this Stand can anticipate the
ball's course with perfect precision.

And he's not cheating!

Another home run! It's four to three!

How can we stop him from reading our minds?

How?

I'm going to turn this around soon.

Now, will the next one be inside?

Down the middle? High? A changeup?

I wonder where it'll go.

Your hat...

Heh, you fool.

Do you think I'm using underhanded
methods, like my brother?

Jotaro, that's not it!

Hiding behind your hat won't help.

He's not reading the reflection
of the screen in your eyes.

And it's not a trick where
he's listening to your fingers

as they push the buttons to figure
out what you're going to do.

I've been watching him.
That's not what's going on.

This is the first time I've
sweat or bled in a while.

That's why I took it off.

I'd like you to hurry up
and throw your next pitch.

But I don't think I have to
worry about sweating anymore.

I'm going to declare my pitch.

It's going to be a straight,
high to the outside.

What?

Wh-What? What did you just say, Jotaro?!

You heard me.

Menacing

Are you so old that your
hearing's gone, old man?

I said I was going to declare my pitch.

I'll throw a straight, high to the outside.

Jotaro!

Menacing

Will you believe me or not?

Are you stupid?

What did you just say, Jotaro?!

I said I was going to declare my pitch.

Jotaro is not lying.

Yes.

You rigged the console somehow!

No.

Your school hat proves that you're cheating!

It's not cheating if you don't get caught.

Wh-What? What did you just say, Jotaro?!

You heard me.

Are you so old that your
hearing's gone, old man?

I said I was going to declare my pitch.

I'll throw a straight, high to the outside.

Jotaro!

Will you believe me or not?

Are you stupid?

Vrrrr

My Stand can see my opponent's soul,
as if with night vision.

No matter who a person might be,
the soul does not lie.

Yes or no? Right or left?

When the question is asked,
I know what they will choose.

Outside or inside? High or low?

A change-up or a straight?

I can know the answer 100% of the time.

Episode 42  The Miasma of the Void, Cool Ice, Part 1

A straight, high to the outside?

Yes or no?

Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

Jotaro is not lying.
A straight, high to the outside...

He's really going to throw that.

What's he trying to do?

Apparently, he defeated my brother by bluffing,

but does he actually think he can intimidate me?

What a fool.

I'm pitching.

Don't forget that the game will be called
once there's an 11-point difference.

Curve

What?! It was a change-up!

It shot through! Impossible! It turned!

And it's a hit!

But the infielder throws to first,
and the batter's out.

I-Impossible.

There was no mistaking that he
chose a high straight to the outside.

Even if he were a holy man like the Buddha,
or a genius con artist like my brother,

he couldn't possibly control
his own soul like that.

I'm going with a high straight
to the outside again.

Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

O-Once again, he's not lying. He's serious!

Jotaro... You're not cheating, are you?

I do! I do! I do! I do!

What?!

He is cheating?!

A forkball, low to the inside!

Pop-up fly to the pitcher.

Out!

You cheated... Jotaro, you bastard!

You rigged the console somehow!

No! No! No! No! No! No!

What?

It's not rigged?

I know that you're cheating!

What kind of trick is it?

H-He's not responding.

Damn it! The question has
to be a yes or no question!

It seems your mind-reading questions
can only be answered with a yes or no.

Your brother liked to say this...

It's not cheating if you don't get caught.

It's not cheating if you don't get caught?

How dare you speak like you know it all?!
Who do you think you're talking to?!

Pitch, Jotaro!

I'll figure out your trick,
and drag your soul out!

Now, then. Shall we continue?

My next pitch will be...

A straight, high and to the outside.

Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

Jotaro's soul is not lying.

He's serious about throwing
a high outside straight.

I'll figure it out! I'll figure it out!

I will figure out this trick!

Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

His soul's will hasn't changed.

It's still saying "yes."
He's really going to throw that.

Here it comes!

Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

It's still saying "yes."  He threw a straight!

But it dropped! It's a forkball!

What?! It changed course!

Yes! Yes! Yes!

Bottom of the 1st

Out! Three outs, change!

I don't understand!
I don't know how he's cheating!

Up to the very last moment,

Jotaro's soul intended to throw a straight.

And yet the pitch changed!

Why?! Why the hell is that happening?!

I will defeat you, D'Arby.

Shut up!

Th-The fact that you took off
your school cap is suspicious.

The cheating started as soon
as you took off your school cap!

Get up! I'm going to inspect
your seat and controller.

D-Damn it! I don't get it. I don't know how,

but that cap is how you're cheating!

I'm right, aren't I?!

No! No! No! No!

Your trick is somewhere around here, right?!

No! No! No! No!

You're using Star Platinum
to cheat, aren't you?!

No! No! No! No!

You rigged something, didn't you, Jotaro?!

Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

God damn it! I... I can read people's souls!

I can read your soul, Jotaro!

But why are all the pitches
different from my readings?!

He, uh... looks like he's aged a bit.

He doesn't look like a kid
in his twenties anymore.

D'Arby, it's your turn to pitch.

Hurry up and throw.

Four to three...

I can win one run back in no time.

I'm a genius when it comes to games.

There's no way I can lose.

I'm a genius when it comes to games!
There's no way I can lose!

My mind, too...

Schooled through many battles, it is invincible!

An expert at games is an expert at life!

I won't let this damage me!

It's in! It's a home run!

The Jaguars score their fifth run!

It's five to three!

Sh-Shit! I accidentally let go of his soul!

Kakyoin's soul and
consciousness have returned!

N-No! No! I haven't admitted defeat!

It was an accident!
I let go of his soul by accident!

If his soul was set free,
that means that your own soul

has admitted defeat.

What?!

J-Joseph's Stand...
It's coming out of the controller.

O-Oh, whoops.

S-Something so stupid...

The cheat was... The one manipulating
the controller... Damn it...

It wasn't Jotaro controlling it,
but you, Joseph Joestar!

Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

That's right, D'Arby.

I'm sure your brother would have
been able to figure this out easily.

Bam

By the way, old man.

I'm glad you caught on to
my idea without a signal.

Of course I can tell what you're thinking!

You're my grandson.

Snap out of it, Kakyoin.

D-Damn it... From behind...

Now, then.

All that's left is to dispose of him.

P-Please forgive me!
I gave you Kakyoin's soul back!

Everything's back to normal now!

Forgive me, please? Please? Please?

If you want to know if we'll forgive you,

why don't you read our souls?

No! No! No! No! No!

Here's a question. Will I hit you
with my right fist or my left?

Try to guess.

P-Please, just hit me quickly with your right.

No! No! No! No! No!

Y-Your left?

No! No! No! No! No!

I-Is it both?!

Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

Yes!

Are you going to do the "ora ora" thing?!

Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh my God!

D'Arby Younger
Unable to Recover (Must Retire)

D'Arby Younger has retired.

Looks like we broke through some sort of wall.

We can get out there, Jotaro! Kakyoin!

Good grief.

Forgive me for interrupting your rest.

I believe that you are aware of this,
but about ten minutes ago,

Joestar and his party infiltrated the mansion.

Also, I must report that D'Arby has fallen.

D'Arby was a genius.

Why do you think D'Arby lost,
despite having the ability to win?

Come in, Cool Ice.

Pardon me.

The Joestars truly believe, from the bottom
of their hearts, that they are willing

to throw away their own lives to save

the one who is Joseph's
daughter and Jotaro's mother.

Kakyoin and the other two...

Hmm...

Right. Avdol and Polnareff have also decided

they would risk their lives in order to defeat me.

It appears they think that

running from me means running from life itself.

How truly foolish.

But it seems that foolish
notion is important to them.

D'Arby had sworn fealty to me,

but it seems he was not ready to die for me.

That's why he wasn't able to win in the end.

D'Arby will never know why he lost.

Ice...

Look at the wound on my neck.

It's likely that if I drink the
blood of one more person,

this body of Jonathan Joestar's,
which has resisted me,

will fall completely under my control,

and this wound shall be healed.

Ice...

Will you offer me your blood?

Yes. With pleasure.

Please accept this!

You removed your own head...

That makes me happy.

But Cool Ice...

I cannot accept blood from
someone of your caliber.

I shall heal my wound with another's blood.

There's no need for you to die.

Return to life with my blood.

With your resolve,

I have no doubt that you will triumph.

Lord DIO...

It truly is best to have your own body.

It's immediately compatible.

I will leave them to you, Cool Ice.

Lord DIO...

I will live up to your expectations.

I shall eliminate them all, without fail.

Open the door if you're going to leave.

After all, your Stand can disappear
completely from this world.

Cool Ice

The ten minutes we promised them have passed.

Mr. Joestar said to set fire to the place,

but let us enter the mansion instead.

Yeah.

Polnareff, before we go in,
there's something I'd like to say.

Even if you were to get lost or
severely injured within this mansion,

I do not plan to help you.

The same goes for you, Iggy.

It might sound cold,

but we are on this journey to defeat DIO.

Promise me that even if I am defeated

or become separated from you,
you will not stop to help me.

You must think of your own safety first.

We cannot allow all of us to be defeated
as we try to save one another.

Yeah, I got it, Avdol.

If we get out of here alive,
you'd better treat me to a fancy dinner.

And Iggy, too.

All right, let's go in.

Silver Chariot!

Hey, Avdol. What do we do?

It looks like it goes on forever.

Mr. Joestar said to set fire to the mansion,

but in a labyrinth like this,

setting a fire would put us in danger.

More importantly...

Magician's Red!

This flame detects lifeforms.

It can sense breathing, cutaneous respiration,

and the movements of both humans and animals.

It can also sense another Stand's energy.

Let us observe it as we navigate this maze.

Why are there six flames linked together?

Each one points to the front, back, left,
right, up, and down, respectively.

As long as it's within fifteen meters,

it can tell how big something is
and which direction it's in.

Mr. Joestar and the others
were dragged underground.

Let's head down.

The flame has already picked up something.

There's something to our left.

What?!

The Fool!

Hey, hey. Wh-Who the hell is that guy?!

Look around us, Polnareff!

Huh?!

The mansion's maze has disappeared!

It appears he was the Stand user
that created that illusion.

It was instantaneous, but Iggy defeated him.

Name: Billie Jean
Stand Power: Illusions   Retired without a fight

His name was Billie Jean, and he
was retired without even a fight!

So the mansion has been
restored to its normal state.

The flames aren't picking
up any signs of life.

After you see this
writing and turn around,
you will...

After you see this
writing and turn around,
you will...

After you see this
writing and turn around,
you will...

After you see this
writing and turn around,
you will...
die.

Die

There is no change in the flames.

Iggy's nose hasn't picked up anything, either.

Wh-What is that?!

Impossible! Iggy's nose and my
flames didn't sense him at all!

He appeared out of nowhere!

Polnareff! Iggy! Look out!

H-Hey, Avdol! Where are you?

Wh-What was that just now?

Wh-What are th-those arms...?

H-Hey, Avdol!

Where'd you go?!

Avdol!

Where are you?!

Avdol!

Avdol!

Wh-What the hell is that?

Where did he come from?

Why didn't Avdol's flames sense him?

Hey, Iggy!

You couldn't smell him with your nose?

Answer me!

Where are you, Avdol?!

Where did you go?!

Avdol...

has been disintegrated. He is dead.

I do not know where the void
inside my mouth leads,

but it is a dimension of darkness.

I sent him there.

You two are next.

I must correct your arrogant belief
that you can defeat Lord DIO.

One by one... In order, in order...

I shall scatter you throughout
my dimension of darkness.

You're lying...

Saying that...

That you killed Avdol...

Don't lie to me!

Next Episode Preview

Is fate telling me to live on?

I heard another wall fall down.

More sounds of destruction?

He's full of spite.

I will eliminate you.

Don't let his spite overcome you!

There's no time to deal with the pain...

Suck on my sword and die!

Wh-What?

I hadn't heard

that Polnareff's Stand was so fast,
or could attack at this distance.

Look over here, damn it! You piece of shit!

Slice

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
Stardust Crusaders

Episode 43  The Miasma of the Void, Cool Ice, Part 2

What was that?

Just when I thought the illusion had gone away,

I heard the sound of a wall
breaking somewhere in the mansion.

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

Could it be Avdol and Polnareff?

Damn it! I know I hit him, b-but he's not dead...

They suddenly shrank and
disappeared into their dimension.

The user and the Stand both...

Avdol... God damn it.

You're... You're the one who said...

Polnareff! Iggy! Look out!

You said if something happened,
we had to think of ourselves first.

You said you wouldn't save me.

You liar!

Ever since India, all you've done is
meddle in other people's problems!

Avdol! You should have just left me alone!

If I hadn't crouched down just then,
I would have been killed.

Is fate telling me to live on?

Is Avdol's will telling me to fight?

It's too dangerous to stay in this room.

Let's move, Iggy!

Grar

Up there, Iggy!

Go upstairs! Up those stairs!

That's the exit! That's the door we came in.

But we can't go out that way.

Avdol sacrificed himself to save us.

Because he believed that we could defeat DIO.

I can't betray the trust of someone like that!

Running away now is what a loser would do.

I'm not running away.

I'm running to get to that bastard, DIO!

Let's run straight to him!

And I thought they'd go for the exit. So close...

I'm impressed that he managed to injure me.

It is indeed true that Polnareff

has a mindset that allows him
to conquer fear and face danger.

Without a doubt, I will corner
and kill him. Without a doubt...

My Stand is far stronger than he is.

The inside of his Stand's mouth
is a dimension of darkness?!

I can't even imagine what that dimension is like,

but it lets him get close without any
sounds, smells, or other signs of life.

But how...

How am I supposed to beat that guy?

H-He cut us off!

He's nearby.

He's here!

Iggy, watch my back!

I'll watch yours.

He can't come through without
breaking a hole in the wall.

What I do know is that

the moment he shows himself
from that dimension of darkness

is when we'll have our chance to kill him.

Come at me, damn it! I'll cut you in half!

Right now, my Chariot is incredibly fast.

Because of how angry I am at losing Avdol!

What?! H-He's in the crack under my foot?!

Chario—

Grar

My foot!

First, I've taken your foot,

so you won't be able to run around or escape!

Bastard!

Whoa, there.

Mr. Joestar! The sound of another wall breaking!

Yeah, there's no doubt about it.

Avdol and the others are in this
mansion, and they're fighting.

Hurry! We have to find them!

You managed to hide during
the confusion, Polnareff.

But it's no use.

With that foot, you can't go far.

You're probably under some rubble nearby.

You are powerless before me.
Without a doubt, I will defeat you.

Now, where are you, Polnareff?

What's all this noise, Cool Ice?

L-Lord DIO!

Please be careful!

Polnareff and that dog are hiding nearby.

Please leave this to me.

You need not personally trouble
yourself with this, Lord DIO.

The fake DIO we made using The Fool tricked him.

Usually, I'd feel guilty about attacking
someone from behind like a coward,

but since that's how you killed Avdol,
I don't feel even a shred of pity!

It's exactly how you deserve to die!

Do it, Iggy!

Cream

Cool Ice

Do it, Iggy!

Break through his scapula,

and split him open to the hip,
like a mackerel!

No! Damn it!

He figured it out!

Sunlight streams through this room's windows.

The real Lord DIO would never

leave his room to enter this place.

Iggy!

The real Lord DIO told me he trusts me,
and that he would leave this to me!

So, no matter what happens, he would
never descend to this second floor!

Shit! He's going to kill Iggy!

Iggy will be swallowed up by
that dimension of darkness!

You shitty little mutt! How dare you?!

You made me destroy an image of Lord DIO!

Wh-What the hell? He punched him!

He didn't use his dimension of darkness!

He punched Iggy across
the room without killing him!

Of all things...

Even if it was a fake Lord DIO made of sand,

how dare you make me strike him?!

I'll kick you to death, you bastard!

It takes but an instant to be swallowed
by my dimension of darkness!

That is not enough time for my anger to wane!

This is all your fault! You!

You're the one who has angered me!

This is all your fault!

Learn your lesson!

How's that?! Learn your lesson!
How's that? How's that?!

S-Stop...

Cool Ice isn't right in the head.

This is overkill.

He's mad that he had to attack DIO's image?

His mind itself is the dimension of darkness!

His mind is the black abyss
that rips everything apart!

Lord DIO said

that we cannot underestimate
the power of human resolve.

But you're no more than a filthy dog!

You don't have resolve,
or a proud soul, or anything like it!

Stop...

How's that? And that?

Stop...

How's that? And that?!

Stop it, Cool Ice!

Bam

I will end this, Polnareff!

Damn it!

He disappeared!

But...

Iggy!

Our fake DIO made of your sand Stand failed,

but your sand gave me a hint.

I've figured out a way to read his movements!

I can see him.

I can see the route he's taking!

Serves you right! I've got you!

You bastard!

When you use your dimension to move,

you have to swallow up whatever's in your path.

So swallow this! Swallow the sand
and head this way, you shithead!

And when your rotten, stinking
mouth appears, that's when

you're going to crumble!

I hit him head-on! Hell yeah!

Your other weakness, Cool Ice,

appears when you try to confirm my location.

You've got to poke your head out
of your dimension of darkness,

or you can't see what's outside!

Suck on that!

Suck on my sword until you die,
you piece of shit!

Y-You bastard...

I pierced your brain stem
through your throat, damn it!

Hurry up and die! You're mortally wounded!

Just hurry up and die!

Die, Cool Ice!

I will not die.

I do not have time to suffer pain.

Whatever it takes, I will kill you!

Whatever it takes, I will swallow up Iggy
and kill Joestar and the others!

I can die after that!

You bastard!

A wise move. You've pulled your sword free.

This time, I will send you to hell!

Is this the vile arm that stabbed me?

You bastard...

Damn it! I had no choice
but to shove him away!

Shit!

Oh, no, you don't!

I cut it! B-But this isn't good...

Grar

Damn it! He got my leg. I can't move.

But I don't have time to
think about pain, either.

And I was so close to finishing him, too!

This guy is just...

He's obsessive!

He's crazy, but he's completely
obsessive about serving DIO!

I can't let that overwhelm me!

I can't die until I kill you, either!

That bastard! Here he comes!

Take this!

Grar

I-It's no use. I cut him, but he
swallowed the tip of my sword!

It's impossible to attack him when
he's in his dimension of darkness.

I'm just going to get being swallowed up.

He's swallowing up everything
in his path. God damn it!

Bastard... Since he knows I could attack him,

he's decided to just guess where I might be
and strike anywhere and everywhere!

He's got good instincts.

At this rate, he'll hit me for sure.

I have to pull back Chariot.

D-Damn it... Iggy's losing blood like crazy.

A bunch of broken bones are piercing his lungs...

Talk about reckless... The walls are disappearing.

N-No... I had the wrong idea!

This isn't instinct. His moves are calculated!

He's moving around in circles,

and the circles keep getting smaller.

He's on a path like a cyclone...

No, like a mosquito repellent
coil, closing in on me!

Even if he doesn't show up

to see where I am, he'll hit me eventually!

I'm caught in his trap.

A-Am I going to be able to dodge him with this leg?

I-I've got to dig through the floor and get away.

It's no use. I don't have enough time!

He's coming at me!

I somehow managed to dodge...

But he's going to keep closing in,

like a needle on a record.

In about five more rounds, he'll be here!

Now, here's the question...

How am I going to dodge when
I have this hole in my leg?

There's no way Mr. Joestar and the others,

who entered the mansion ten minutes earlier,

would show up in the next couple of seconds

like American comic book heroes—ta-da!—

and save me at the last minute.

For all I know, Mr. Joestar and the others

are struggling in their battle, too.

Looks like answer #1 is the only option.

Chariot! Pull me out of the
circle as hard as you can!

Damn it! Pull me faster!

I-It's no use!

Grar

Despair! The answer he's been left with is #3.

Answer #3

Reality is cruel.

My Silver Chariot is a Stand
that cuts things with a sword.

Now that I'm so badly injured,
it doesn't have the power to pull my weight.

Damn it...

You wreck! Keep still, you idiot!

If you move or use any more
of your Stand's power,

your broken bones will pierce further
into your lungs, and you'll die!

What are you trying to act
all tough for, you idiot?!

Are you trying to save me
so you can die along with me?

I'm the one who's going to look cool saving you!

You have to survive and warn Mr. Joestar
and the others about this bastard.

The important thing is to defeat him!

Avdol saved me, but you
don't need to save me, too!

If we all die, it's over!

One more time around,
and he'll come right to me.

The answer is #3.

Reality does not forgive.

Looks like his obsession... wins.

So long, Iggy.

This blood is not your doing.

It is Avdol's.

I don't know the details.

I have really bad luck with friends...

Not to the likes of you!

It happens every time.
I only realize it after they're gone...

Wh... What are these remnants of destruction?

It's a perfectly round opening,
like someone pulled out a cork.

Wh-What is it...?

The destruction continues on beyond this room.

These are clearly signs that Avdol and
the others encountered an enemy.

Jotaro! Break down this door! We're going in!

Yeah.

So long, Iggy.

Episode 44  The Miasma of the Void, Cool Ice, Part 3

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

Polnareff. It is not by your hand that I bleed.

It is by Avdol's.

At that moment,

I had planned to eradicate
both you and Avdol all at once,

but he knocked you out of the way.

Normally, in such a situation,

one would instinctively
focus on protecting himself.

This blood is the result of that.

But although I am injured,
it will take some time until I die.

I shall go finish off Joestar and the other two!

I will, without a doubt, eliminate them.

Iggy... I told you over and over
not to use your Stand...

Trying to act all cool and shit...

I told you so many times.

Polnareff!

Cool Ice said that a mere
dog could not have resolve.

That he could not possess a proud soul.

But Stands are the soul's manifestation.

Iggy's soul had moved on its own.

It had no choice but to move.

Th-This feeling in the sand...

How could this have happened? Damn it!

It's an empty shell. A Stand's empty shell...

This is cold annihilation...
The destruction of life.

Damn it! I'm the one who survived!

Ig...

Iggy!

You're too slow, Cool Ice.
And you're exactly right.

I have really bad luck when it comes to friends.

I was supposed to save Iggy,
but instead, he saved me.

Damn it...

How can this be?

I just realized how much I liked him.

It always happens this way.
I only understand after they're gone.

I thought you were a stubborn,
shitty little mutt,

but I loved how you acted so stubborn,

and refused to be friendly with any human.

I realize now that your refusal to show

affection for anyone proved
just how proud you really were.

I told you not to save me...

Damn it! It's because of your stubbornness that...

Rumble

I knew it. Cool Ice, you bastard...

I thought it was strange.

You're immortal. DIO did
something to you, didn't he?

Wh-What... i-is... this?!

You didn't notice your body changing?

You received his blood, didn't you?

To think you're becoming something
I've heard stories about.

You're the same as DIO.

A soulless, filthy vampire!

You bastard!

Looks like you started to turn into a vampire

around the moment I stabbed
you through the mouth.

Go on.

Indulge your obsession to the fullest!
Try and do something!

You're obsessed with
protecting DIO, aren't you?

Come at me! I'm right here!

What's wrong, Cool Ice? Come on!

You will not...

Go to Hell.

A-Avdol... I-Iggy!

W...

Was that an illusion?

Or...

Either way, I have to climb up those stairs

and get to DIO.

I don't have time to cry in sadness now.

Avdol has died
Iggy has died

The Fool

Iggy

Japan.

It has now been 43 days since
Jojo and the others departed.

Stop for a moment, Rosas.

Please, stop the car.

Soba                   Soba Midokoro

Madam, you're not thinking about
stopping at that soba stand, are you?

Indeed I am!

It's been so long since I've been in Japan.

I'm going to have a bite
before I go see my daughter.

You hold my little turtle for me.

You mustn't, Madam!

These places are intended for busy men,

not for ladies like yourself.
That is the Japanese way.

You are Madam Joestar.

Oh, hush. I'm going to record
a commemorative video.

Very good! Very good!
Soba

This plebeian atmosphere... It's so good!

Do not puke or piss

Mr. Rosas.

Have you not told her about
her daughter Holly's condition?

Hurry it up, Rosas! Come, come!

I-I'll be right there...

I... I haven't told her yet.

She came to Japan thinking

she was just visiting her daughter,
who had mild pneumonia.

I have served the Joestar family for 30 years,

ever since Miss Holly was in grade school.

I know I should have told her the truth.

But... I lacked the courage.

So we arrived in Japan before I could tell her.

Miss Holly's strength has run out.

She has only a few days left.

I could tell her, if you'd like.

N-No... I have lied this long
to Madam about Miss Holly.
Hiring
Part-timers

I will tell her myself.

Is it true that she might be cured if

the man called DIO is defeated?

Yes. If he is defeated.

Miss Holly's body is reacting
to an energy called a Stand,

which only certain people can see,
and is being overwhelmed by it.

By the evil energy of the man known as DIO...

The Madam cannot see Stands.

But when she encounters the
shadow of death, she will sense it.

You must go tell Madam Joestar right away.

Sh-Shadow of death?

Come, Rosas! What are you doing?

You should have some curry udon, too.

Madam, there's something I must tell you...

Oh! I must get some footage of the

Family
Planning

vending machine serving that
peculiar energy drink, as well!

Premium Skin

Good. Very good. Would you like one, Rosas?

Madam, please stop! Those are not drinks!

P-Please listen, Madam!

Oh? To what?

Th-The truth is, Miss Holly...

This Japanese person is so unique and cool!

Good. Very good!

Hello, hello, give me smile!

What the hell?

Who gave you permission to videotape me, huh?!

Gah!

Madam, please get back in the car!

Yay!

Come back here, damn it!
Are you messing with me?!

Hand over that camera!

Who the hell do you think you are,
you foreign granny?!

Want to see some blood,
you shitty old woman? Huh?

Hey, that's quite enough.

Do not lay a finger on the Madam.

Kabam

Madam, please! Learn a bit more about Japan.

Okay.

I-I couldn't tell her

that Miss Holly only has a few days left.

I can't bear seeing Madam in shock and sadness.

We've come this far before I could tell her.

The Kujo household is almost in sight.

I must tell her now...

I must be the one to tell her!

Rosas.

I know there's something you want to tell me.

I already know what's been troubling you.

My daughter's life is in danger, isn't it?

When I called her from New York,
Holly always sounded cheerful and strong.

She said that she just had a little cold.

Joseph would also call me
while he was on the road,

saying that he was doing fine
and oh so terribly busy.

But somehow I knew

that something terrible was happening
to my daughter and my husband.

I've lived with my husband for fifty years,

and I gave birth to my daughter, after all.

I was frightened.

I was too scared to verify the truth.

The more I wanted to see my daughter,

the more frightened I was to come to Japan.

Since we're discussing it now,
we should tell you clearly.

Miss Holly's survival will depend
upon these next few days.

Mr. Joestar and the others
went to Egypt to address

the source of her illness,

but I have not heard any news from them yet.

P-Please forgive me for not telling you, Madam.

There was nothing we could do for Miss Holly,

and that was so painful...

It was so cruel!

What nonsense are you speaking, Rosas?

There is just one thing we can do for Holly.

Holly.

Mom...

Rosas, listen carefully.

The one thing we can do for my daughter

is believe.

I do not know the details, but I have faith.

If my Joseph and my grandson, Jotaro,

are trying to do something to save my daughter,

then I will believe in them.

Ever since I met that man
in Italy fifty years ago,

he has never betrayed my expectations.

Once he decides he's going to do something,

he will follow through, no matter what.

Believe in Jotaro and Joseph.

Get better, and we'll all be
together as a family again.

Mom...

Madam... Miss Holly...

Star Platinum

Jotaro Kujo

Cool Ice... Billie Jean... D'Arby Younger...

All of you were fools after all!

Bam

I can't help but belly laugh in sheer satisfaction
to think they got what they deserved!

Calling me "Nukesaku" like I'm some moron...

You're the dumbasses who got killed!

Nukesaku, it is impossible for you

to defeat Joestar and the
others with your powers.

Just stay out of it.

H-Hey... Let me in on the action, too.

You're nothing more than a vampire.

Just try and interfere. We'll kill you if you do.

Just stay put, Nukesaku.

I'll be the one who finishes off Jotaro!

Stop! There's something in
front of us, to the right.

It's a woman...

P-Please spare me!

Don't drink my blood!
Please don't drink my blood!

I'll do whatever you say!
So please, spare my life!

H-Hey, just wait a second. Calm down.

I won't try to run away again!
So please... spare my life!

Calm down!

We aren't DIO's minions, and we aren't vampires.

You can consider us friends.
We'll help you, so calm down.

Friends...

Friends? A-Are you really friends, not foes?

Will you really help me?

That's right. We're friends...

Crush

Of justice, that is.

That's right. We'll help you.

We'll help you go straight to Hell!

Right, Kakyoin?

I-Impossible! Wh-Why? Why?!

How did you figure it out?!

My power is invincible!

Is your power having the face of a
woman on the back of your head?

You should have at least
turned your hands around.

Th-That's right!

I didn't realize... Damn it!

Hey, Nukesaku.

Where's DIO's room? Tell us.

Jotaro, don't knock him out.
Let's have him guide us.

Why, you...

You called me "Nukesaku"...
Don't mess with me!

I'll kill you!

I am immortal, for the blood
of Lord DIO is in my body!

Oh? Did you just say you were immortal?

So you're a vampire like DIO...

Well, then, I guess I'll have to
see just how immortal you are.

Oh my God!

I see. So you are immortal.
But even if you are a vampire,

it's still possible to cut you into pieces.

Come on. Lead us to DIO. The sun's setting.

Okay... But may I ask you one thing?

How did you know that they call me "Nukesaku"?

Good grief.

Those curtains were made of some nice cloth.

Now I can move better, and even jump.

It still hurts,

but I don't have time to
lose heart or worry about pain.

Rumble

So it's you, Polnareff. It's been a while.

DIO.

You're here at last.

Next Episode Preview

So we finally meet, DIO.

I don't have fond memories of them.

I do not regret this journey.

I-I'll tell you everything that just happened.

Not good. Something here is not good!

When did he bring out that Stand?

So we finally meet,

DIO!

Congratulations, Polnareff.
You've avenged your sister,

and managed to travel from
the Far East to make it here.

If you want to give me a prize for that,
how about you give me your life?

I shall give you a chance.

Go down two steps,

and I'll let you join my side again.

But if you'd rather die,
then climb those stairs.

When I first met you,

I succumbed from the bottom of my heart
to your spell of fear and immense evil.

That was when I became a loser.

It's much scarier than death,

living with no desire but to do your bidding.

But right now, I don't feel any fear at all.

I feel only my will to fight.

Since I met Mr. Joestar and the others,

this journey of 45 days
and the death of my friends

have completely blown away my fear of you.

Is that so?

Then climb those stairs.

I see, Polnareff.

You've gone down the stairs,
which means you wish to join me, DIO.

Wh-What?! I know I just took a step up...

What's the matter? You're losing
your composure, Polnareff.

Doesn't one lose his
composure when he is afraid?

Or is it that in your heart,
you know you must climb up,

but you're so terrified that your body

subconsciously did the opposite and went down?

Impossible! I know I went up the stairs!

Wh-What did he do?! Is it his Stand?

I-It can't be...

DIO's Stand...

The World?!

Wh-What is...

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
Stardust Crusaders

Episode 45  DIO's World, Part 1

Polnareff, have you ever considered
why humans wish to live?

Humans live hoping to conquer
their anxieties and fears,

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

and attain peace of mind.

Seeking fame,

controlling others,

and acquiring wealth are all
done to achieve peace of mind.

Marriage and friendship are also pursued
as means of attaining peace of mind.

When humans say they wish to help others,

or that a thing is done for love or justice...

It's all merely to give themselves peace of mind.

To achieve peace of mind
is the goal of all mankind.

Now, given that, what anxiety could
you possibly feel toward serving me?

Any other peace of mind
will come easily if you do.

Doesn't challenging me, even knowing
that it may spell your death,

bring you anxiety?

I-It can't be! Am I subconsciously
submitting to him?

You are a very capable Stand user.

It's a waste to kill you.

Why not cut ties with Joestar and the others,

and serve me for eternity?

I can promise you peace of mind for eternity.

I can't go on like this...

Avdol, Iggy... Give me courage!

Y-You talk too much, DIO!

I've already died once.

I won't die again until I figure out
the identity of your Stand!

You leave me no choice.

Then you'll just have to die, Polnareff!

So that's The World? Bring it on!

Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

M-Mr. Joestar!

Don't worry, Polnareff.

DIO!

That was DIO, wasn't it?

We're going after him!

Before you go after him, let me say this.

I just experienced his Stand, just for a moment.

Actually, it wasn't so much an experience...
It was completely beyond my understanding.

I-I'll tell you exactly what happened.

I thought I was climbing the stairs
toward him, but before I knew it,

I was actually going down!

I-I'm sure you guys don't
understand what I'm saying,

and I don't know what he did, either.

I thought I was going insane.

It wasn't anything simple,
like hypnosis or super speed...

I experienced something much more terrifying.

Where are Avdol and Iggy?

Th-They didn't make it...

They died saving me.

I see.

Mr. Joestar, the sun is setting.

We must hurry.

You're right.

Hey, Nukesaku. What's above this floor?

A-A tower.

There is a single room at the very top.

Lord DIO stays there during the day.

Do any other staircases lead up to that tower?

N-No. These stairs are the only way.

All right. Lead the way.

So that's him.

The man we're about to face

is one I've never met,
yet one I've known for so long.

Yes. I have always known him.

I've known him since the day I was born.

The same goes for Jotaro.

He's not someone we have fond memories of.

Our Joestar blood always knew that

he was someone we would encounter
one day, someone we must defeat.

I have no regrets.

The journey we've made,
the events about to transpire...

I regret none of it.

What I'm feeling right now
tells me the side I'm on is white.

DIO's side is black.

Mr. Joestar and the others, too, are white.

Despite my injuries, I can
feel my courage growing.

I am on the white side,
the side of righteousness!

Once he steps out of the coffin, we'll attack.

But be careful.

There's no guarantee that he's in there.

Nukesaku, open the lid.

L-Lord DIO, I promise, I did not betray you.

It's because I truly believe in
your power that I led them here.

As certain as when you piss in a
strong wind, it'll get on your pants!

Please understand!

Shut up and open it already!

Make sure you kill these bastards,

Lord DIO!

He's going to come flying out!

Huh?

Me?!

I-I was the one inside?!

But I was the one that opened the lid!

Wh-What?! How?!

I never took my eyes off him!

Did any of you see the
moment Nukesaku entered...

No, was put into the coffin?

N-No... I was watching the whole time,

but when I realized it, he was already inside!

It's as Polnareff said!
This is not merely a trick or super speed!

We're in danger.

Something here is truly dangerous!

Run!

D-Damn it!

What are you doing, Polnareff?

Damn it!

What in the world was that?

I didn't actually see it, but it felt much

more powerful than any Stand
we've encountered so far.

It was like knowing a bulldozer is present
from the sound of its engine alone.

I felt it, too. It was incredible murderous intent!

It felt like someone stuck an icicle up my ass!

If we had stayed in there,
we would've been killed, one by one!

This is bad... This is extremely bad.

The sun's almost out of sight!

His time has come.

Don't tell me that we're

going to be helpless until sunrise tomorrow.

I'll telling you now, Mr. Joestar!

There's no way I'm going to run away now!

I agree with Polnareff.

I feel the same way,
but the situation has changed.

We've encountered his Stand, The World,

but we have no idea what it does.

When climbing a mountain,
if you don't know the route,

or where the summit is,

you are guaranteed to get lost. Guaranteed!

It's as inevitable as belching
after you drink a cola.

We know DIO will come after us.

He'll try to finish us before sunrise.

In that time, we'll have
the opportunity to figure out

his Stand's true ability.

We have to wait for that chance.

No! I can't run away!

Avdol and Iggy died for me!

I'll do underhanded things,
and even go to Hell itself,

but I will not run away!

Wait, Polnareff!

It's no use trying to stop him, old man.

Jotaro, tell us what you think we should do.

Polnareff is fighting him as he pursues him.

We'll fight him as we retreat.

That means

we'll be in position for a pincer attack.

Hey, you there.

I want to buy that truck. Sell it to me.

What'd you say? I need this to do my job!

What're you—

I'm flooring it, Kakyoin!

There you are, DIO!

Run away until sunrise? Like hell I can do that!

I'll finish you myself if I must!

If I don't know what your Stand is,
then even without that knowledge,

there are still plenty of ways to beat you.

I'll assassinate you!

Don't do anything rash, Polnareff!

I told them to leave someone
as stubborn as you alone,

but the old man and Kakyoin
insisted that I stay with you.

So here I am.

Jotaro...

Good grief.

The World

Ah, the automobile...

Its power and speed are impressive.

In my day, we had only horse-drawn carriages.

Hey! What do you think you're touching?

This car belongs to Senator Phillips!

Do you wanna puke from your eyes?!

My, my... Young folks are
so hot-blooded these days.

Ow!

Shut up and get in the front seat.
You're going to drive.

Wh-Who the hell are you?!

Do you think you're going
to get away with this?!

No, of course he won't!

No one could get away with doing this to me.

I graduated high school and
college at the top of my class!

I was captain of my college wrestling team!

Even after I graduated,
I was respected and revered.

That's how I became a politician!

I have a villa on a thousand acres in Hawaii!

I married a beautiful model
who's 25 years younger than me!

I pay 50 times more in taxes
than ordinary people!

I've defeated every enemy that I've faced.

I'll eventually become president.
I am Senator Phillips!

Listen up, young buck!

You'll get life in prison for this!

You hear me? Life in prison—

I'll say it once more.

Drive.

Wh-Who the hell is he? He's going to kill me!

If I don't escape, he'll kill me!

If I don't escape, he will kill me!

Help... me?

Wh-What?!

Wh-What?!

I thought I jumped outside,
so wh-why... why... am I inside...

Why am I inside?

Floor it until you catch up to that truck.

If you fail to catch up to it, I'll kill you.

Y-Yes, sir.

Why inside?! Why?!

I know! It's because I'm a senator!

There's nothing a senator can't do!

The black atmosphere that emanates
from him is still close...

It's coming after us.

He's coming after us!

Can DIO tell exactly where you are, Mr. Joestar?

No. His body is that of my
grandfather, Jonathan Joestar.

We can sense each other due to something
like a strange wavelength between us,

but we can only tell that the
other is close, not where he is.

I couldn't tell exactly where the mansion was,
either, even though we were nearby.

All he can sense is that a Joestar is nearby.

He can't tell the difference
between Jotaro and myself.

He shouldn't be able to realize that
Jotaro and I have split up.

That's strange...

In movies, the engine always starts right up.

W-We're stuck in traffic.

Rush hour traffic in the
evening is bumper to bumper.

Go.

You say that, but I can't move forward.

The sidewalk is wide enough. Go.

The sidewalk?!

It's packed with people heading home from work!

That makes no difference. Go.

Y-Yes, sir!

Floor it.

Yes, sir!

It started. Hurry up and get on, Polnareff.

R-Right...

I've gone to such lengths for you!

You'll spare my life... You'll spare
this senator's life now, won't you?!

No.

I see! This is a dream!

A senator like me could never die this way.

It's a dream! A dream! Hooray!

There he is. Get closer to them. Closer.

If I'm not close, I cannot use The World.

He's getting closer. It's that car! DIO's in there!

Kakyoin!

Kakyoin's...

Take this, DIO! Emerald Splash!

Wh-What is he?!

He didn't so much as move from his seat,

but he managed to dodge with just one finger!

How about this?!

Even when I concentrated the Splash,
he dodged. D-Damn it!

When did he release his Stand?

Impossible! How could I not notice?!

He was a bit too far away.

He went flying out of The World's range.

Wh-What's happening?!

Would it benefit me in any way if I told you?

Keep your eyes forward and drive.

Careful, Kakyoin! You got too close to him!

I-I apologize. I-I couldn't help it.

A few months ago, he said,

"There's no need to make
yourself vomit from fright."

"Relax. Relax, Kakyoin..."

Damn it! Never again! I will never lose again!

Kakyoin, are you all right?
Did you see The World?

Yes... I attacked from around ten meters away.

If I had gotten any closer,
I would have been done for.

It's obvious that his Stand

has some terrifying secret far
beyond anything we can imagine.

But I've managed to figure out two things.

First, it can't attack over distance like
Hierophant Green and Hermit Purple.

It's a close-range power type, like Star Platinum.

Its range is about ten meters.

Second, it attacked with its fist.

So it doesn't use ranged attacks, like bullets.

If we can get within ten meters
of DIO without him noticing,

I think we may have a chance of defeating him.

We need to investigate carefully.

There's no such thing as being too
cautious when it comes to him.

That's strange. His car stopped.

Watch out! Something's flying at us!

Mr. Joestar!

What are you doing, Kakyoin?

I've got it.

I've figured out a way to reveal
what DIO's Stand truly is.

Next Episode Preview

I wonder why I get goosebumps
when I think about Avdol and Iggy.

Perhaps because they were the first
friends I shared a common goal with.

This journey to defeat DIO...

Show me your Stand, DIO!

What are you doing, Kakyoin?

I've got it.

I've figured out a way to reveal
what DIO's Stand truly is.

What?!

Rumble

Whenever Noriaki Kakyoin sees his
Hierophant Green, this is what he remembers.

Your little Noriaki doesn't try
at all to make friends.

It's not that the other kids don't like him.

He just doesn't open up to anyone.

As his teacher, I'm very concerned.

I'm his mother, yet I still
don't know why he's like that.

Ever since I was a child, I thought

that living in a city means
meeting a lot of people.

But even in an entire lifetime,

how many people meet others they can truly
understand, and who understand them?

My classmates' address books are
filled with their friends' names.

There must be about fifty friends in each.

Maybe even a hundred.

My mother has my father,
and my father has my mother.

But I'm different.

I'm sure rock stars and people on TV
have tens of thousands of friends.

But I'm different.

I probably won't ever have someone
who sees me for who I am.

Because I don't have a
single friend who can see

my Hierophant Green.

It's impossible for

those who can't see him to understand me.

Until I met Mr. Joestar, Jotaro,
Polnareff, and Avdol,

I felt that way all the time.

I wonder why I get goosebumps

when I think about Avdol and Iggy.

Perhaps because they were

the first friends I shared
a common goal with.

This journey to defeat DIO...

Even though it lasted only a few weeks,

they became friends I
could truly connect with.

Noriaki Kakyoin looks at
Hierophant Green and thinks:

I'll make him invisible to everyone,
just like he used to be.

Yes, to reveal DIO's true
identity and defeat him,

I'll make his presence completely disappear.

Episode 46  DIO's World, Part 2

Hey, Jotaro!

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

That car's crushed to pieces.

Up there.

The old man and DIO are on the rooftops.

Only Kakyoin and Joseph are before me.

I see.

They split up so they could
attack from both sides.

So Jotaro and Polnareff must
intend to attack me from behind.

How useless.

This is...

Kakyoin's Hierophant!

Hierophant's barrier!

This is...

That's right!

Hierophant's barrier, which
activates when touched,

completely surrounds you for
20 meters in every direction!

Now I can sense both your
movements and The World's!

Take this, DIO! 20-meter
radius Emerald Splash!

You fool. You shall soon know

that The World's true power is, indeed,
the power to reign over this world!

Bring out your Stand, DIO!

The World!

Doom

What?! Kakyoin!

He was suddenly blown away!

Impossible!

Kakyoin!

Wh-What... just happened?

Did he beat me?

It's no use. I think my injuries are fatal.

I can't speak... I can't even lift a finger.

It's 5:15...

That means it's around midnight in Japan.

I wonder what my parents are doing.

Maybe they're already asleep.

I'm sorry for making you worry so much.

Noriaki Kakyoin's final thoughts

were not of his parents in Japan.

Though he cared deeply for his parents,

when his mind drifted to the final
question that puzzled him,

thoughts of his parents drifted away.

I can sense every movement of those
who touch Hierophant Green's barrier.

But DIO ripped apart the entire barrier at once.

Why wasn't it done strand by strand?

It was completely simultaneous,

without even a microsecond
of a time between them.

The entire barrier, over a 20-meter radius,
was ripped apart all at once?

How?

Without even the slightest delay...

How... all at once...?

How?

Kakyoin!

I-I can't let this continue! Hermit...

Joseph... You're next.

Don't you think taking the blood of a Joestar

would be just the thing to make
Jonathan's body completely mine?

DIO!

How could he hit them all with
no time passing between them?

Time passing...

Time...

Time...

The time!

I... I understand now.

H-How could this be?
There's no other explanation.

I-I have to tell them about this!

This terrifying truth... Somehow...

I have to tell Mr. Joestar...

At this rate, everyone will

be defeated.

How dare you do that to Kakyoin?!

I'll take that body back, for my Grandma Erina!

Erina? Ah, that country girl.

How foolish.

I shall drink your blood and kill you.

Joseph Joestar!

Die!

M-My final Emerald... Splash...

What?

He didn't even aim in the right direction.

I suppose he wanted to use up

the last of his strength to go out with a bang.

Impossible!

Kakyoin wouldn't do something
pointless at a time like this.

So why in that direction?

What does it mean?

Is he trying to tell me something?

It's a... message.

It's the best I can do...

Mr. Joestar...

Please understand.

Please, figure it out...

Kakyoin...

Noriaki Kakyoin

Noriaki Kakyoin has died.

Noriaki Kakyoin
— has died —

Hermit Purple!

And take this!

The sun's own energy, Hamon!

You old fool! Your Stand is the weakest of all!

I won't let you get away!

Kakyoin, why did you shoot the clock tower?

What was shooting the
clock tower supposed to tell me?

It must mean something important!

I-It's Mr. Joestar!

DIO's chasing after him.

Where's Kakyoin?!

Could it be, Kakyoin...

Were you able to solve the mystery

of DIO's Stand while all that was going on?

He destroyed the clock with Emerald Splash.

He destroyed the clock's hands...

He... stopped the clock?

I-Impossible! Could it truly be...

The true power of DIO's The World

is the power to stop time!

Take this, DIO! 20-meter
radius Emerald Splash!

The World!

Doom

This is The World.

But since time has stopped for you,
you can neither see nor feel him.

Die, Kakyoin!

You don't even realize that you've been killed.

There's no way for you to
even know what happened.

I understand, Kakyoin!

You died to send me that message...
and I've gotten it!

Hermit Purple

Joseph Joestar

It stops time?

It's a Stand that can stop time and keep moving?

That's too dangerous! Way too dangerous!

Calm down... Calm down and think!

I don't know the meaning of the word "panic"!

I need to think of something...

Some way to break through and defeat him!

H-He disappeared!

Wh-What's wrong?

Not going to hit me, DIO?

Weren't you going to drink my blood?

You've suffused your body with Hamon

to protect yourself.

Hermit Purple, infused with Hamon,

is like a high-voltage wire wrapped
around your body, isn't it?

You're quite the schemer,
you cunning old geezer.

The same goes for you.

You realized I was using Hamon
and made sure not to touch me.

Very attentive of you.

But I've figured something
out about your Stand.

DIO, though you can stop time,

it looks like you can only do so very briefly.

About three to four seconds, I'd say.

If you could stop time for any longer,

we would have all died back at your mansion,

and you wouldn't have had to chase us down.

So you understand how The World works? Hah!

I'll spare you a bit of praise for that.

It was Kakyoin who figured it out.

I won't let Kakyoin die for nothing!

And what of it?

What good does understanding
my Stand's power do for you?

What can your Hamon possibly do now?

Hermit Purple and Hamon!

Enough!

I don't need to touch the Hamon to attack you!

Hey, look.

That old guy fell outta the sky!

Santa! I bet he's Santa!

What were you doing on the roof?

Checking out some hot chicks?

Old man...

J-Jotaro!

Stay back!

Don't come near me!

Jotaro... What perfect timing.

But he's not quite in range.

I'll deal with Joseph first.

Jotaro! The secret of his Stand,
The World, is time!

It's a Stand that stops ti―

The World!

At first, I could only stop time
for a mere blink of an eye.

But as my neck wound began to heal,

I soon could stop it for two seconds, then three.

I can now stop time for five seconds.

It's strange to think of it as five seconds,
since it occurs when time is stopped,

but I have five seconds in which to act.

Eventually I'll get to a minute...
Then ten minutes, then an hour...

Then as long as I want!

It's quite exciting,

knowing that I will be able to stop
time for longer and longer...

Oh, that's right, Joseph.

You were using Hamon to protect your body.

Hamon gave me a little trouble
a hundred years ago,

but it's powerless before The World.

Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

Useless!

Halt

The grandson of Jonathan, Joseph...

You are now dead!

One more second...

Zero.

The World

Old man!

S-Stay back! R-Run... J-Jotaro...

D-Don't go near him.

K-Keep your...

d-distance...

Stay away... Stay away from him...

Y-You're no... match...

I've already taken care of Kakyoin, too.

Polnareff must be hiding somewhere...

Hah. But it doesn't matter.

You're next, Jotaro!

You bastard.

DIO!

Oh? You're approaching me?

Instead of running away,
you're coming right to me?

Even though your grandfather, Joseph,

told you the secret of The World,

like an exam student scrambling to finish

the problems on an exam until the
last moments before the chime?

I can't beat the shit out of
you without getting closer.

Oh ho! Then come as close as you like.

Too slow, too slow!
The World is the ultimate Stand.

Even without his power to stop time,
his speed and power

far exceed that of your Star Platinum.

So it's the same type of Stand as Star Platinum.

Not much range, but immense
power and precise movements.

I wanted to try a little test to find out

just how much more powerful The World
was, compared to your Stand.

Though it appears a test was hardly necessary.

Test? Is that what you call just patting me,

and not even enough to hurt?

Well, I guess you ripped my
20,000 yen pants, though.

Why are you Joestars so stubborn
about admitting defeat?

Hmph. I suppose I shall rise
to your silly provocation,

and test you just a bit more.

Shall we compare the speed
of our attack rushes?

Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

I first experienced stopped
time half a year ago.

It began when everything around
me seemed to have stopped.

It will be The World's true power
that deals the final blow!

precision are both superior!

I've seen enough. I'm satisfied.

I will end you now!

I have decided that

fighting one of the Joestar bloodline,
but will kill them instantly!

The way to end you is with

Episode 47  DIO's World, Part 3

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

With this, the Joestar bloodline will finally end.

My archenemies, who dared to
make an appearance in my destiny...

Farewell!

Wha—

What?

He just moved!

He... Impossible!

His finger just moved!

I-It can't be.

It can't be!

They're... the same?

So it's the same type of Stand as Star Platinum.

The World and Star Platinum
are the same type of Stand?!

Can he see me?

Or is he moving his hand subconsciously?

Time's up.

Bam

Could you see me?

I asked if you could see me, Jotaro!

Who knows?

I don't know what you're talking about, DIO.

Very well! It doesn't matter!

It doesn't matter if you can see me
during stopped time or not!

If you can move the same way as my The World,

let me see you moving!

Yes, it was six months ago
when I first stopped time.

In order to test out my
Stand's power and speed,

I had one of my servants
fire a shotgun at me.

As I went to catch the pellets...

For a moment,

it looked like everything had stopped.
That's when it all began.

At first, I thought it was an illusion.

Trained boxers and those who are in accidents

feel each moment as if it were
several seconds or minutes...

I thought it was something like that.

But The World was able to step

around the pellets that hung
suspended in stopped time.

And...

It could grab the pellets!

It's not an illusion!

Lord DIO!

You will surely be able to control time!

You must believe with more conviction
that you can move within stopped time!

It must be like breathing.

Like being able to snap an HB
pencil in half with your fingers!

You must believe it's a perfectly
natural thing for you to do.

What's most important is
to recognize it as such.

You must believe that
it's natural for you to do it!

You are the emperor of this world!

It's only natural for you to control time!

Clang

And then one day, I felt the wheels of time

truly enmesh themselves with The World.

It was like a beam of light
piercing the darkness.

It truly was a magnificent feeling.

I, DIO, had truly surpassed
all forms of life and all Stands!

And now, I can stop time for five seconds,
and longer and longer intervals each time!

Jotaro! I shall see just
how powerful you truly are!

The World! Stop time!

You had placed that magnet on me.

When we were testing each
other's strength earlier?

It looks like a magnet taken
from a wallet or pocket planner.

You completely fooled me.

I can't take my eyes off you for a second.

But!

If you're using a trick like this,

that proves you can't move during stopped time!

You only added a few more seconds to your life!

This time, you will...

Die, Jotaro!

Zwoosh

Bagoom

What?!

H-He... really can move!

Only for a moment, but he can move!

The magnet wasn't to trick me
into thinking he could move...

But to trick me into thinking he couldn't,
and lure me closer!

You must believe it's only natural
that you can stop time!

Of all things, this descendant of the Joestars

has invaded my world of stopped time...

I could move for a moment... Just a moment.

But...

Good grief.

It was only enough to get one punch in.

You. Woman.

Fetch my leg from over there.

Hurry up and fetch it!

Behave like a flight attendant,
bringing a drink

and caviar to a first-class passenger!

I guess I have to bash your head to pieces,

or it'll be like nothing ever happened.

You've already recovered your energy.

Because that hole I put in
your gut is closed up now.

Your eyes followed me in
the world of stopped time...

So you truly can see my movements, Jotaro.

Seems so.

Kakyoin did quite well for you.

Because he figured out the
secret of The World's powers,

you were able to figure out that you
could move during stopped time,

and so, you were able to invade my world.

Which makes me think...

Just how long can you move
within my world of stopped time?

Two seconds? Three?

Or perhaps you can move five seconds,

just like me, and you're just
pretending that you can't? And so on.

Well? How about it?

This isn't good.

I could move longer with some practice,

but right now, a moment is the best I can do.

I believe that you can only
move for a moment now.

But since you have invaded
my world of stopped time,

it would not be wise to
underestimate you by getting close.

Even when I still have an
overwhelming advantage.

Therefore, Jotaro, I've decided how to kill you

such that it doesn't matter
how long you can move!

You've gone pale.

When you saw these knives,

you realized that you face a more
horrific fate than that geezer Joseph.

Bastard!

How the hell does he come
up with stuff like this?

He's dangerous.

You cannot escape!

The World!

Five more seconds!

Once time begins to move again,

I wonder if even your Star Platinum

can manage to deflect so many knives.

Four more seconds!

Being able to see this must be
all the more terrifying, Jotaro!

Three more seconds...

Just two more seconds...
Is that all you can do?

This proves that you really can
move only for a moment.

One more second...

Zero.

It's over.

I'll add one more, just to be sure.

To be frank, I'm relieved that

I could defeat you so quickly, Jotaro.

I never thought you would be
able to enter my stopped time.

As I see it, those machines known as
automobiles are useful devices,

but because everyone has one,
the streets become too crowded.

Only I, DIO, should have
power over stopped time.

Good grief.

Throwing all those knives...

Now my valuable uniform is full of holes.

I stuffed my clothes with magazines
just in case he tried throwing anything...

But I didn't think he'd throw
that many knives at me.

Playing dead and waiting
for a chance to strike is the

best chance I have right now.

I need to figure out how
to knock off his head...

Otherwise, he won't die.

I'd better play it safe.

The Joestar bloodline has
proven itself rather lucky.

He might be trying to
trick me by playing dead.

I must end him beyond
a shadow of a doubt!

By...

chopping his head off with this!

This is truly the end for you,

Jotaro!

Die, DIO!

The World

Die!

Polnareff!

The World! Time has stopped...

So it's you, Polnareff?

And time will move once more.

Too bad, Polnareff.

With just a moment more,

and with just a tiny bit more force,

you could have torn my brain
apart with your rapier.

B-Bastard! This is impossible...

You cannot assassinate DIO.

Joestar's Egyptian tour group

will be no more, once I finish you.

Damn it. Polnareff's going to get killed.

I wanted to play dead as long as possible,

until I could land a blow to his head, but...

It would be easy for me to keep
Polnareff's head on his shoulders.

But DIO won't enter
Star Platinum's attack range.

It'll end up like it did last time.

I have to make sure he
doesn't realize I'm alive.

As long as he doesn't know for sure,

my chance to get close to him will come.

Talk about irony.

I tried my hardest to move
inside his stopped time,

but now I have to try my hardest
to stay completely still.

Farewell, Polnareff!

Jotaro, you...

You're alive... or you're coming around.

Dont move! We're the police!

We have guns pointed at you!

Put your hands up slowly.

All right. Perfect timing.

There's something I'd like
you to shoot with that gun.

Shoot the man lying on the ground over there.

You can shoot his leg, his torso...
Whatever you like.

Come on. Be sure not to miss.

Perhaps I was just imagining
that sound I thought

I heard coming from Jotaro.

What a sick thing to do...

But now DIO's attention
is on me, not Polnareff.

Right now, he's suspicious as all hell.

He'll try to make absolutely
sure that I'm dead.

This is when things get really dangerous.

The sound of his breathing...

I don't hear it. He's not breathing.

Then what about his heartbeat?

This is damn tough...

If I black out, I really will die.

It won't even be funny...

If I die because I used my
Stand to stop my own heart...

His heart isn't beating. He is definitely dead.

I thought he was still alive,
but it was just my imagination.

Just in case, I'll lop off his head
so that I can truly rest at ease.

All right, Jotaro?

Rumble

What?!

Rumble

Stop time!

The World!

I went through hell there...

But even if you stop time,

I'm still going to blow your head off, DIO.

Wh-What? It can't be...

Finally...

Finally, I was able to bash his head in.

But that bastard DIO is a monster

Menacing

who survived a hundred years
at the bottom of the ocean.

I can't believe he's dead yet.

It's too soon to relax.

I'll kill you...

Wh-What is this? Impossible! M-My legs...

I can't move my legs.

I can't stand!

I have a headache... a-and nausea...

How could this happen? Me, DIO, feeling sick?

My head's been destroyed, so I can't get up?!

Damn it! I have to do something!

I covered you with gasoline
so I can track your smell.

I feel bad, kicking a guy
when he's down, but...

Nah. I don't feel bad about this at all.

My friends and a lot of innocent bystanders

are dead because of you.

The World!

If I can...

If I can get to that place...

Time... Time will move once more.

He put his ear to the ground
to listen for cars coming near.

But...

I can't let him get away!

Screech

That place... That place!

If I can just get there...

This place is taken. You can't escape.

Give up, DIO.

The World! Sto—

You fell for it, Jotaro!

This is my escape route!

You have lost in the battle
of wits against me, DIO!

Doesn't this street look familiar?

This street... I-It can't be...

That's right.

It was my escape route to take
the blood of Joseph Joestar!

DIO, you bastard!

This is the greatest high!

As I thought...

Joseph's blood suits me well.

It suits this body so perfectly,

my strength is recovering
faster than ever before!

It suits me...

It truly suits me!

This body belonged to Jonathan
Joestar one hundred years ago.

The blood that I just drank was
from his grandson, Joseph!

And the one who allowed me to make it this far

was you, Jotaro.

The Joestar bloodline was mere dog shit
on the road that is my destiny,

just something lying in my way...

But in the end, it appears that the
Joestars are fated to be my tools.

O-Old man...

O-Old man.

No matter...

No matter what DIO is about
to do to my body down below,

you must never get enraged
and lose your cool, Jotaro.

Don't worry about me anymore.

This happened because it had to happen.

Is this... the old man's soul?

Kakyoin solved the mystery of DIO's Stand.

I relayed his message to you.

If we had all fought DIO at once,
we would have all perished instantly.

You've become able to move
a bit within stopped time.

You have two or three seconds now...

Use that time wisely.

No matter what DIO does now,
you mustn't get angry.

If you fly into a rage and strike first,

you'll only put yourself in a bad situation.

Jotaro...

This trip was truly fun, wasn't it?

So much happened.

I swear...

These fifty days really were fun.

Was I seeing things?

Hey!

Where are you looking, Jotaro?

Bam

B-Bastard...

Now he's just an empty shell!

The old man told me not to
get angry, no matter what.

But that's not possible.

No one could stay calm after seeing that!

This is the final round!

The World! Stop time!

Wryyyyyyyyyy!

One second has passed!
Two seconds have passed...

This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

Three seconds have passed! Four seconds...

Five seconds have passed.

Six seconds have passed.

Seven seconds have passed!

I still feel the power!

I can still keep it up!

By the way, Jotaro.

You shouldn't be able to move any longer.

You probably gambled on the two seconds

before time starts to move again,

but you've miscalculated.

What a truly magnificent feeling!

I feel so good, I could break out into song!

Eight seconds have passed!

One hundred years ago, I attained immortality,

but I didn't feel as absolutely
wonderful then as I do now!

Joestar blood suits me so very well!

This is the greatest high!

O-Old man... You were right.

Getting mad has gotten me into trouble.

But this isn't the end of it.

I still have plenty more rage to hurl at him!

Nine seconds have passed!

I've stopped time for nine seconds!

But it appears that stopping time for
nine seconds is my current limit.

Y-You bastard...

Now to unleash all of my Stand's power!

Jotaro! You said something
about being pissed off...

But your fury can achieve no more than that!

Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

Useless!

And now, without pause, my final attack!

The last and final time I will stop time!

Within my nine seconds of
stopped time, I shall end this!

The World!

One second has passed.

Two seconds have passed.

Three seconds have passed.

For some reason, DIO disappeared
while time was stopped.

Four seconds have passed.

However, Jotaro has abandoned thought.

No matter what DIO has planned,

or what attack he might unleash

in the two seconds that Jotaro
can move within stopped time,

all he needs to do is drive Star Platinum's
fists into him in those two seconds!

Five seconds have passed.

The one thing that I know, DIO,

is that the next time I see your face,
I'm probably going to bust a vein!

Six seconds have passed.

Bring it on, DIO!

Seven seconds have passed.

Road roller!

Kaboom

It's too late! You cannot escape!

Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

Eight seconds have passed!

I'll smash you flat!

Nine seconds have passed.

I did it.

It is over.

Star Platinum has finally been
defeated by my The World!

Immortality! Eternal life!

And Stand power!

This proves that no one can surpass DIO!

Puny humans! I shall rule you all!

Bow before my knowledge and might!

Ten seconds have passed!

Now my ability to stop time
has reached ten seconds!

Now, then...

I guess I should find Jotaro's
lifeless body and drink his blood.

If there's any blood left to take!

Wh-What?

My body's movements a-are slowing down...

N-No... I'm not slowing down...

I-I cannot move. I-Impossible!

M-My b-body won't move at all!

DIO!

It's been eleven seconds.

I guess that's your limit now.

What?!

I stopped time at the nine second mark.

That let me escape.

Good grief.

Now...

It won't take even a second to finish you off!

J-Jotaro!

The World

I-Impossible! You stopped time?

Right at the end of my
nine seconds of movement...

How does it feel, DIO?

Having someone approach from behind
while you can't move a muscle,

if I had to describe it,

is like when a guy who can hold
his breath underwater for a minute

finally comes up for air at the very last second...

When suddenly, he feels someone
grab him, and he's dragged

back down into the water.

Does that sound right?

But for you, I feel no pity at all.

Crack

Time has begun to move again.

I don't feel even the slightest
bit of compassion for you.

I haven't even an ounce of pity for you.

However, just finishing you off
by beating you to death now

would leave a bad taste in my mouth.

How many seconds will it take
for your legs to recover?

Three seconds? Four?

The moment you've healed,
I'll throw Star Platinum at you.

So bring it on!

If I were a gunslinger in a Western, I'd say...

"Draw. Let's see who's
the fastest gun in the West."

H-He's...

mocking me!

But... But, Jotaro...

You may have come this far,
but you are still only human.

You think like a human,
who has so little time to live.

About things leaving a
bad taste in your mouth,

or living your life with no regrets...

That kind of reasoning is about
as compelling as rat shit

in a bathroom, and it will be your demise!

I, DIO, have no such thoughts.

Within my mind is but one simple thought.

Just one!

To be victorious and rule! That is all.

That is all I need to feel satisfaction!

How I do it...

...does not matter!

How do you like being blinded by blood?!

I've won! Die!

Wha...

What?!

I-Impossible... I-I'm DIO...

I am DIO!

Now if I just wait until dawn,
you'll turn into dust.

There's only one reason why you lost, DIO.

There's just one simple answer.

You really pissed me off.

Jotaro Kujo

This is the Speed Wagon Foundation Car Two.

We are currently traveling
north on Al-Nil Street.

We have retrieved DIO's body.

I repeat. We have retrieved DIO's body.

DIO's body will stay alive until
it is exposed to sunlight.

Proceed with caution!

Make sure you don't let down your guard.

Roger.

Noriaki Kakyoin is dead. We are
transporting his body via helicopter.

Jean Pierre Polnareff is unconscious.

He is currently being treated in Car One.

Roger.

By the way, I've got a
question for you, Car Two...

Why did you put DIO and Joseph
Joestar's bodies in the same car?

Because it's not over yet.

DIO borrowed something...

Huh?

And I need to get it back.

I have no idea what you're talking about.

Is it possible to transfuse blood
from one corpse to another?

A-Are you suggesting we put DIO's blood
into Mr. Joestar's withered corpse?

Are you trying to bring
Mr. Joestar back to life?

DIO sucked out his blood just minutes ago.

DIO's upper body has been annihilated,

but I want him to return what he's still got.

Don't you think we can still make it in time?

So he says. Did you hear that? Over.

R-Roger...

I-It's impossible! He doesn't have a pulse...

That means his heart has stopped,

so it's impossible to make blood
circulate throughout his body!

Impossible?

We did a lot of impossible
things on this journey.

I'm tired of hearing that things
are "impossible" or "useless."

Those words mean nothing to us.

You said we have to get
his heart moving, right?

Good timing.

Thanks to DIO, I've had practice
with stopping and starting hearts.

I hear a pulse!

His heart's moving!

Hurry! Extract the blood from DIO's
body and perform the transfusion!

This just might work!

L-Look!

His shriveled skin is already regaining color!

His flesh is softening and stretching!

Brainwaves! We're detecting brainwaves!

I can't believe it! His heartbeat is regular!

His eyes! He opened his eyes!

We did it! He's come back to life!

Old man?

You fool, Jotaro!

Y-You bastard! It can't be...

Thanks to you, I live again!

You!

W-Wait, Jotaro! I'm kidding!
Kidding! I'm just kidding!

It's just a joke! A joke!

Sorry! I was just messing with you a little.

It's definitely me!

I'm Joseph Joestar. I was
born September 27th, 1920.

My wife's name is Suzie Q.
I like to collect comic books!

Who's the female lead in the
1981 film, Tarzan, the Ape Man?

Bo Derek.

Who sang the parody of
"Beat It," named "Eat It"?

Al Yankovic.

Good grief. I guess you are the real thing,

if you know pointless crap like that.

This is Car Two. It's amazing!

Mr. Joestar has woken up!

Mr. Joestar has come back from the dead!

Hooray! Over!

Now you've returned what you took from us,

DIO.

Now, it's over.

So many people lent something to DIO.

Many people, for the last hundred years.

They lent him everything.

And too many of those things
will never be returned.

Yeah. The things we can't get back
are too numerous, and too great.

What we've lost is as vast
as the planet Earth itself.

But it's all because of them...

It's because of them that we still live.

Kakyoin.

Iggy.

Avdol.

It's over.

Are you really going back to France, Polnareff?

You don't have any more family there, do you?

Why don't you come to New York with me?

Mr. Joestar, even though my family
is gone, France is my homeland.

I have many memories in my hometown.

No matter where I go,
I'll always return there.

But if you ever need me, give me a call.

Wherever in the world you are,
I'll come running.

It'll be lonely without you.

There were many hardships,

but it was a lot of fun.

That journey was fun
because all of you were there.

Yeah.

Yes, it was fun. I believe that
from the bottom of my heart.

Passengers on France International
Airlines Flight 92,

bound for Paris, please head to Gate 18.

Well, see ya, you shit-stained geezer!
I hope you live forever!

And you, his stingy grandson!
Don't you dare forget me!

Let us meet again!

If you don't hate me by then,
you little jackass!

I couldn't forget a guy like you if I tried.

Take care.

So long.

Yeah.

So long.

Holly...

Why are you sitting up all of a sudden?

I... Suddenly, I feel so much better!

And I just felt it in my heart...

What?

They're both coming home, Mama!

Holly!

Papa and Jotaro!

They're coming home!

EndGood morning! Greetings, all.
This is Morioh Radio,

and your host, once again, is me,
your neighbor, Kai Harada.

What a refreshing morning.

And I have the perfect song
here to start off the day.

Here's our first song of the morning.

Oh, there we go.

We usually get good reception
when we pass that tower.

Is this your first time in Morioh, sir?

Yeah.

What kind of place is it?

Morioh? Hmm...

Oh! The beef tongue cooked in miso is good.

Anything strange about it? Any incidents?

No idea.

Sorry, I actually don't know that much about it.

Oh, where was I supposed to drop you off again?

In front of the station is fine.

Understood.

Good grief...

I just hope nothing annoying happens.

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable

In April of 1999, on my very first day
of high school, I met two bizarre men.

Episode 1  Jotaro Kujo! Meets Josuke Higashikata

I finally start high school today...
I wonder what the people will be like.

My name's Koichi Hirose.

Though you don't really have to remember that.

I was so nervous on my first
walk to my new school that I...

Bam

Eh? H-Huh? That's strange.
We just ran into each other,

and the things in my bag flew out...

Sorry I wasn't watching where I was going.

H-He's huge! He's over 190 centimeters!

I have a question.

Do you know of a Higashikata
household around here?

Higashikata? No...

Then how about this address?

It's Johzenji 1-6.

Jotaro
Kujo
Jotaro Kujo...

If you take the #3 bus,
it'll get you to Johzenji.

If you wait a little while, it'll get here soon.

Thanks.

The first guy was this man, Jotaro Kujo.

I found this out later, but he's 28,
and he's a marine explorer.

He's famous in the scientific world
for his ecological research.

He seems really wild, but
intelligent... or cool, I guess.

Hey! Are you a new kid?

You better introduce yourself.

Y-Yes, sir! My name is Koichi Hirose,
and I'm a new student.

Good morning, Senpai!

All right. Well said.

S-So scary...

Oh, it's okay. They're getting on a different bus.

The hell are you doing, you bastard?!

Who do you think you are?

What am I doing? Well...

The turtle that lives in this pond woke up
from hibernation, so I was watching it.

I don't handle turtles really well.
I'm scared to even touch them.

So I was thinking it's about
time I got over my fear...

That's not what I asked!

Stand up, dumbass!

You're pretty tall for a first-year.

But before you have the
nerve to dress like that...

You dumb shit! Who said you could wear that?

You need to talk to us first!

W-Wait... I'm not a fan of reptiles.

They scare me...

Slap

What the hell are you smiling at?

I'm sorry. I had no idea, Senpai.

There are a lot of guys

I last saw in a hospital after they
said they didn't know and were sorry.

You wanna end up

like this turtle?! Huh?!

Th-They're awful...

I'll let you off the hook this time.

Take off that jacket and the pants,
and leave them here.

With your cash!

Yes, sir! I'm very sorry!

That just means if you don't want them
after you, don't dress like that.

What pisses me off more is that

he isn't even mad after what
they did to that turtle.

Hey, wimp. Why don't you tell me your name?

Yes, sir.

Josuke Higashikata, from Class 1-B.

What? Josuke Higashikata?

Student ID
Name: Josuke Higashikata

"Jo" and "Jo," eh?

Josuke, we're gonna call
you "Jojo" from now on!

Okay... Thank you very much.

Hurry up and take off that uniform.

The damn bus is here.

If you don't hurry it up, I'm gonna
shave off that Astro Boy hair, too.

Well, what are you waiting for? Hurry it up!

Hey, Senpai...

What did you just say about my hair?

What? A Stand?!

My nose... My nose!

I won't let anyone get away with making
fun of my hair, no matter who it is!

Did you say my hair looked like Sazae-san?

Huh?! No one said that...

I heard you, damn it!

What the heck? That punk just went flying.

Some kind of Stand just
appeared from behind him.

Huh? That turtle's wounds are...

What the heck?

Where you got punched
is going back to normal!

Hey, he's all better!

But does it look like it healed all weird?

His face looks kinda different.

Huh?

No way! What does it look like? Hey!

I had to touch that turtle,

even though I didn't want to, thanks to you.

What are you gonna do about that, huh?!

Wait! My nose! What's it look like? Huh?

Good grief. So he's...

Gah! That scared me!

Oh, it's just the turtle again.

I was right. That turtle's all better.

Josuke Higashikata...

Born in 1983.

Your mother's name is Tomoko.

She was 21 at the time,
and was going to college in Tokyo.

You've lived here ever since you were born.

In 1987, when you were four, you came down
with a fever due to an unknown cause,

and for the next 50 days,
no one knew if you'd survive or not.

Your father's name is...

Good grief. This is such a rotten role to play.

Your father's name is Joseph Joestar.

He's currently 78.

He's the founder of Joestar Realty.

I've heard of him before.

Apparently he's a huge
real estate mogul in the US.

He's still doing all right,

but when I was looking into how
to split up his inheritance,

I found out that he had a son
in Japan, which would be you.

He didn't even know about it himself.

That old piece of shit...

Going on about how he'd
only ever love his wife,

yet I just found his son who was
born when he was 62 years old

as a result of an affair.

Whoops. I guess I shouldn't have said that.

My name's Jotaro Kujo.

I guess, technically, I'm your nephew.

How bizarre.

Nephew? Oh, uh... Nice to meet you.

Let's talk while we walk.

And so, eventually, you're gonna get
a third of the old man's inheritance.

I came here to tell you that.

The whole Joestar household is in chaos
since the old man's affair came to light.

It's in chaos?

Yeah... My grandma, Suzie Q,
is the angriest she's ever been

in their 61 years of marriage.

I-I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry
I've caused such a fuss!

Hey, now. Hold up.

Why are you suddenly apologizing?

Well, I mean, causing trouble
in a family is no good.

My mother has told me that she was
in love when she gave birth to me.

I accept that, too.

Could you tell, uh, my dad, um...
Mr. Joestar, I mean,

that he doesn't have to worry about us?

That's all.

What's with this kid?

I came here prepared to take
a punch intended for the old man,

and instead, he's actually apologizing?

Hey, it's Josuke!

Oh, it is!

Josuke!

How are you?

Talk about a coincidence!

Let's go to school together.

Your hair looks as cool as ever.

You're looking sharp.

You're so different from the other guys.

Um... I'm actually in the middle of
something important right now...

Huh? What the heck?

If you don't hurry, we're going to be late.

You can talk later.

Hey, Josuke.

I'm not done talking to you yet.
Run these girls off.

What's his problem?

Hey, have your stupid talk about hair later.

H-He actually said it.

He talked shit about his hair!

You bastard...

What were you saying about my hair, huh?!

This isn't good.

Don't blame me!

Josuke hates people insulting
his hair more than anything else.

It's just like what happened earlier!

Hold it, Josuke.

I wasn't insulting you...

Shit! Here it comes!

Bash

Josuke!

There's blood!

Did you see it, Josuke?

This is called a Stand.

It's the physical manifestation
of your psychological energy.

Joseph Joestar has one, too.

Stands can only be seen by other Stand users.

It pisses me off when someone
talks bad about my awesome hair.

I can't even help it!

So this is Josuke's Stand!

Th-This power...

You're wide open from your chin down!

Bastard!

What?!

Huh?

When did that happen?

What's going on?

When did y—

Josuke!

No!

Josuke!

Shut up!

It pisses me off when girls freak out!
Get out of here!

Fine...

It seems like they know each other.

Besides, he's scary.

But he's kind of hot...

I don't get it...

I have no idea what's going on!

But something is definitely happening!

It's been a while...

Actually, it's been ten years.

But I was able to stop time for half a second.

If I hadn't stopped time...
I doubt we would've been killed,

but one of us would've been badly injured.

Here, Josuke.

Ah, uh... No. It's okay.

I see.

There's actually another
reason I came to see you.

The other reason is this picture.

Something is hiding in this town.

Something very dangerous is approaching.

When Old Man Joseph tried to
get a spirit photo of you,

this is what he got instead.

We're not sure why...

But he's probably a Stand user.

This doesn't concern you, but I wanted
to at least show you the picture.

You've been warned.

Koichi-kun...

If you happen to see him,
don't go anywhere near him.

Calling the police won't help.

Just run.

Josuke...

Don't lose your temper
and go after him, either.

You'll get hurt, just like a moment ago.

Oh! The entrance ceremony!

Ack! Look at the time!

Aw, shit...

Who knows what my mom'll do to
me if I'm late on the first day?!

Hey, I'll listen to everything
you've got to say after school.

Hey, Koichi, was it? Let's go!

Huh?

Hurry!

Right!

The other bizarre guy I happened
to meet is Josuke Higashikata.

He's unpredictable and can go
right from goofy to pissed off.

I guess his family situation is complicated.

And we only just met...

Josuke Higashikata... What a weird guy.

And his Stand...

This hat... It's back together?

So his Stand reforms things into a
different shape after they're broken?

If it had been my face or head...

Talk about creepy.

But if I think about him as a
potential ally, he should be reliable.

If you overlook his ridiculous
personality, anyway.

I just hope this has nothing to do with Josuke.

Hey, girl!

Hey, don't be so cold!

C'mon! C'mon!

Ooh, v-very pretty!

You'll go wherever I want?

Hell yeah! I'd go anywhere with you.

Then you can go straight to Hell!

Huh?

Crush

Hey, you okay?

Officer!

G-Go get that crazy bitch!

She injured me! That's a crime!

Nah, I can't do that.

What?!

That's my daughter.

Huh?

Well, you know. You caused trouble for others,

then you called my daughter a crazy bitch.

I'll let it go this time,
but be more careful in the future.

You okay, Old Lady Murakami?

Come on. Grab your bag.

Hey, Tomoko!

Dad.

You headed home?

Yeah.

Let's go home together. I'm done for the day.

How's Josuke?

Today was his entrance ceremony, right?

He'd better not be up to any trouble.

Hmph. Who knows?

That idiot can seem calm,
then get pissed off outta nowhere.

I wonder who he took after.

Hey, now...

But...

Deep down, in the bottom of his heart, he's kind.

No need to worry about him.

Oh, yeah.

Why don't we celebrate him
starting high school tonight?

Yeah, I'm planning to.

But I wonder if he'll come home early.

He'll probably stop somewhere again.

No doubt.

Hey, I want to stop by Kame Yu.

Huh? I just bought you an
expensive bag the other day.

I want to look at, like, clothes today.

Watch it, dumbass!

Pay attention to where you're walking, moron.

He's super creepy.

He's not even gonna apologize
after running into someone?

Forget him. Come on.

I know. You just wanna go to Kame Yu, right?

Huh?

Anjuro Katagiri, a.k.a. Angelo.

Born in Morioh in 1964.

His IQ is 160.

He was sent to juvie for robbery
and rape when he was just 12.

Since he committed that first crime,

he's become the most awful

and disgusting criminal in Japan's history.

He spent most of his youth in jail for his crimes,

a total of 20 years by the time he'd turned 34.

His last crime was so vile, it'd make
even a rat in the bathroom puke.

He was eventually arrested,
and the sentence they gave him

was death.

But, somehow, the execution failed to kill him.

Shortly after, Angelo escaped.

He most likely became a Stand
user right before his execution.

I'm not sure why,

but he's hiding out in this quiet town...

Somewhere.

Koichi, you heading home?

Oh... Yeah.

We're in the same class.

Yeah... Talk about coincidences.

Well, see you tomorrow.

Ah... Hey! J-Josuke!

Huh?

Oh, you want to hear what
that Jotaro guy has to say?

It's been bugging me,
and it has to do with this town.

You're amazing. I'm gonna pass.

Why?

I'm sort of curious,
but when I thought it through,

I don't think getting involved with being
some guy's lovechild is a good idea.

Why?

Well, I mean...

Things are just fine as they are right now.

I see...

I wonder what that is.

Maybe an accident or something?

Wanna go after it?

Yeah.

What? Are they shooting a drama?

It's dangerous, so step back. Step back!

Talk about a huge commotion.

A man robbing that convenience store
took a female employee hostage inside.

Huh?

Look! There he is!

Don't move! Drop the knife!

Let the girl go!

Shut up! Get back!

Th-That lady has rung me up before!

His eyes are messed up.
He'll totally kill her if he loses it.

All of you, get outta the way!
I'm getting into the car!

This isn't good, Josuke! Get back! Back!

R-Right.

Hey, you with the stupid hair!

Sorry, let us step back—

I told you to get away from the car!

I'll kill you!

I have...

a bad feeling about this.

I knew it!

Loom

C-Crap! Here it comes!

At a time like this? In this situation?

After Mr. Jotaro warned him!

Who's that?

H-Hey! Stop!

What did you just say?

Wh-Who the hell are you? Get away from me.

You don't care what happens to her?

Get back, you fool!

What are you going to do if he loses it?

I told you guys to stay back, too!

D-Damn it! You're pissing me off!

I've made up my mind! I'm gonna stab this girl!

Oh, really?

Th-There's a hole in his body!

I pissed you off?

That's my line!

Huh? I-I'm fine?!

She's back to normal. It's happening again.

M-My army knife! It's inside my stomach!

H-How?!

You'd better get a surgeon to take
that out... in the prison hospital.

S-Seize him!

What's going on?

Josuke!

Hey, Koichi.

Are you okay?! That was...

What the...

What are you doing, opening your mouth?

Who would have thought

I'd find another Stand user here?

I possessed this man and was having
a blast with that robbery, and then...

How dare you get in my way?!

He's the guy from the picture!

I'll be watching you from now on.

I'll be watching you all the time.

What'd you say, you bastard?!

Josuke!

You idiot! Get him!

What were you thinking?!
M-Mr. Officer! W-Wait a sec...

What Mr. Jotaro said was true.

Let me go! I didn't do anything!

There's something in this town...

I can feel the presence of
something completely unknown.

Something bad is here in Morioh.

Hey, Josuke! Answer the phone!

Josuke! Answer the damn phone!

Yeah, yeah. One sec.

Hello?

It's Jotaro.

Oh, hi.

We didn't have a chance to
actually talk yesterday.

We need to talk about the
guy hiding in this town.

Oh, I actually wanted to
talk to you about that.

Mr. Jotaro, where are you right now?

The Morioh Grand Hotel.

What happened?

Well...

Damn it, this pisses me off.

Where the hell did I put the shovel?

That little brat...

Looks like he's got a cozy little family.

Not to mention he's got himself
a hot, young mother...

I'm jealous.

Josuke Higashikata, don't get cocky, now.

I'm going to destroy your livelihood,
your soul, and your life.

Episode 2
Josuke Higashikata! Meets Angelo

Episode 2
Josuke Higashikata! Meets AngeloJeez...

Damn it, this pisses me off.

Now, where did I put it?

Anjuro Katagiri, a.k.a. Angelo.

He's become the most awful and
disgusting criminal in Japan's history.

He's repeatedly committed murders
ever since he was 12.

His last murder...

Milkman! Watch your step over there!

...was lower than dog shit.

In March of 1994,

he happened to meet three 14-year-olds.

He raped and murdered two of them.

Did you step in it?

Yes, it appears so.

Seriously, it pisses me off.

Letting their dog shit in front
of someone else's house...

I'm really thinking of keeping it

and putting it in the owner's
pocket tomorrow morning.

Um... I left your milk over there.

I'll be off now.

You...

You're not the usual milkman.

Yes, I'm just covering this morning.

Huh...

Because the third boy was from a rich family,

he demanded a ransom.

That's what led to his arrest.

I might just be picky, but the
seal on this milk's lid is broken.

Huh?

Is it?

Yeah, right here!

Oh, yeah...

See? It's broken, right?

Yeah. Sorry about that.

I'll be going now.

Thanks.

Good day.

Damn that bitch!

Glob

That woman's pretty watchful.

If that woman or her brat,
Josuke, drank this milk,

my Stand, Aqua Necklace,
could have possessed them!

Another one? You just keep going, don't you?

When the police infiltrated the area
where the boy was being held,

they found a truly horrific sight.

The boy was dead, and his privates

had been chopped off and
nailed to a pillar near the corpse.

Why the hell didn't you
clean up your dog's shit?

On top of that, you just threw your
cigarette on the ground, didn't you?

Don't get cocky!

Because those who get cocky...

can just swallow my Stand and die.

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

Diamond is Unbreakable

Episode 2  Josuke Higashikata! Meets Angelo

So it seemed like that Stand
had possessed the robber...

Or rather, it was just in his body.
It didn't attack me.

Was Angelo nearby? The guy in the picture.

No, I didn't see him.

Damn it, my hair's not setting right.

Listen up. That Stand's power is weak,
but it can be controlled remotely.

It's the type that can somehow enter people.

I'm heading to your house now.

Huh? Right now?

Don't eat or drink anything until I get there.

That includes tap water.

Don't shower or use the bathroom, either. Got it?

Hold on a second. I haven't
told my mom about you yet.

My mom's pretty tough, but it seems
that she still loves Joseph Joestar,

and cries when she thinks about him.

She'll know who you are with one look.

Josuke, where did this picture come from?

This is the milkman from earlier...

Do you know him?

Hey, Josuke. What's wrong?

Crap! I was too late.

I just saw that thing go into
my mom's mouth from the coffee!

Hello? Josuke? Hey! Josuke!

Josuke, you want some coffee, too?

Yeah, sure. Could you put in
some milk and sugar for me?

Milk and sugar, right?

Do-
Boom

Josuke? Was it milk and sugar?

Yeah.

Hello? Jotaro?

I caught that Stand, but...

What?

What should I do with it?

How in the hell...

Be careful. Angelo should be watching
over your house from somewhere.

Don't take your eyes off that Stand.

I'll be right there.

Angelo,
Criminal
Condemned
to Death,
Escapes

There's no doubt that Angelo was
able to escape prison and death row

because he used his Stand.

But I still don't know the specifics
of that Stand's power.

Dead ball!

And that's the game!

The game ends with a dead ball!

There, there.

You little shit!

Josuke! You need to get going,
or you'll be late!

I'll kill them both!
That little brat and his hot mom!

Yup!

I need to either get the cap off

or break open this bottle, somehow...

He's...

I'm home. You really feel it when
you work the night shift at my age.

Higashikata...

Come to think of it, it's the same name.

So this is Officer Higashikata's house.

I haven't seen him since I was 12.
Talk about memories.

I know everything about you!

Freeze.

Josuke, why aren't you at school?

Are you allowed to take
your gun home, Gramps?

Oh, shush! Answer me.

I-I'm going! I'm just waiting for someone.

You fool. This is just a model gun.

You scaredy-cat.

I guess I win the first round in our
weekly contest to scare each other.

Yeah, yeah. I lose.

Hm? What's wrong? You're not
even trying to argue this time.

Nothing. Mom already left.

You should go to bed.
You're tired, aren't you?

Now, our next story.

News Bureau

7 Bodies Found In Park

The number of strange deaths occurring

due to the center of the eye or ear

being destroyed has risen to
seven as of this morning.

The police are trying to get to the
bottom of these bizarre deaths,

which have only occurred in Morioh.

They're trying to determine if they
were caused by illness or accident.

I've heard about this.

It definitely reeks of foul play to me.

I can't help but feel like someone really
dangerous is hiding in this city.

Gramps...

Morioh's masterpiece, beef tongue in miso.

He's here...

I know you well, Higashikata.

After you finish your night shift,
you always enjoy a shot of brandy.

Josuke, grab the bottle and get in the car.

Let's take it somewhere isolated.

Right.

G-Gramps...

Josuke Higashikata, this is all your fault!

It's all your fault for not
keeping your eyes on me.

You got too cocky!

It cheers me up

when I see cocky guys step
into the depths of despair!

That was close! That power is incredible...

You're still being cocky!

I'll kill you, whatever it takes!

You hear? Whatever it takes!

Gramps opened the cap on the bottle.

But there's nothing to worry about.

It's just a minor wound. My Stand can easily...

All fixed.

It can't be...

He should wake up.

My Stand can heal wounds.

I've done it lots of times since I was a kid.

I even fixed my friend's broken bone...

Hey, Gramps! I'm gonna be mad
if you're messing around.

Did you really fall asleep because
you had the night shift?

You don't need to try to scare me anymore!

Gramps! Gramps!

Josuke...

The wound's been completely...

It can be said that humans live by destroying.

In the midst of all that, your power
is kinder than anything else.

But once a life is taken,

it doesn't come back.

No matter the Stand, it can't bring it back.

For 35 years, he protected this
city as a police officer.

He sensed the danger here,

and when he heard news about

murders that sounded like Angelo's work,

he had the eyes of a man who
was protecting his city.

Angelo has killed many.

There must be several bodies
of people from this city

that haven't been found yet.

There's no reason for his murders.

It's a hobby to him.

And he'll keep killing, I'm sure.

He's probably going to start
by killing you and your mom.

I'll...

I'll protect this city and
my mom in his place.

No matter what happens.

The funeral has ended,
and his uniform hangs in the closet.

And behind it, the shoes, socks, shirts,
and pants of a middle-aged man,

who would say, "What? This is what I like,"
are neatly folded and lined up.

But eventually, they will
probably be disposed of.

Because, despite his daughter

not wanting to throw them away
since they hold such dear memories,

no one will ever wear them again.

Josuke probably doesn't
want to see anyone right now.

Everything but canned drinks
and foods is dangerous,

so don't consume anything else.

How's your mom?

I had her go to a relative's
house after the funeral.

Good idea. She can come back
after we kick Angelo's ass.

I'm not pissed off or anything.

I just got a little worked up for a moment.

I'm calm. Completely calm.

Calm, huh?

Well, this is your furniture,

so it's up to you if you want
to take out your anger on it.

By the way, that scar on your lip...

That's from when I punched you.

Can't your Stand heal your wounds?

My Stand can't heal my own wounds.

What if his Stand enters your body and
starts tearing things up from the inside?

I'd probably die.

If it invades me, I lose.

You're gonna try to trap my
Stand in a bottle again?

That ain't happening again, Josuke.
I know your powers very well now.

Tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow...

I'll wait patiently for my chance.

— 3 Days Later —

He's come this close to see what's going on...

But these past three days,
he hasn't made a single move.

What's he waiting for?

It's raining...

Rain?

What the hell?

I thought something seemed odd about you.

So you're a Stand user, too?

Well, whatever. I've been
waiting for this moment.

This house is now mine!

You guys can't leave while it's raining!

Josuke!

He was just here all of a sudden,
boiling the water.

He's twisted the faucet, too.

Angelo's Stand has entered the house.

He wasn't waiting for you to drink the water.

He was waiting for it to rain!

His Stand can move in the rain... No.

It can move freely in liquids.

Josuke! Stay away from that kettle!

The steam is him!

This is just great.

We can't capture him in the bottle.

Stay away from the steam.
If you inhale that, you're in trouble.

Get out of the kitchen.

About that... It seems like it won't even
do any good to get out of here.

Angelo has already made
several holes in the roof.

So it's dangerous to go upstairs,
obviously, or outside.

This is just great...

I never would have thought a power

that uses water could be this terrifying.

He's pretty smart.

What's so funny? We're trapped.

Hey!

I mean, Jotaro...

The guy who killed my Gramps is this close.

This is just great!

Now, then. Let's finish this.

Now, Josuke...

How would you

slip out of this situation?

Slip out?

I wouldn't quite word it like that.

I would break out!

Hurry, this way!

The wall's going to go back to normal.

Good grief.

Well, we've blocked the steam...

The humidifier!

Josuke!

I've won! Just as I thought, Josuke!

I knew you'd break through the
wall and come into this room!

Shit!

When horse races or test answers
end up exactly as I expect,

I can't help but feel lucky from the
bottom of my heart and laugh.

It just bubbles out!

Josuke!

What Angelo just said is wrong, Jotaro.

Josuke?

Even when things end up exactly as I expect,
I don't feel like laughing...

Not when it comes to Angelo.

That's...

Got it. Sorry, it's a bit gross.

I shredded up a rubber glove
and swallowed it beforehand.

I see. It appears the user's body is over there.

Sh-Shit!

So you're...

...Angelo.

Damn it!

Y-You guys aren't going to kill me, are you?!

Sure, I'm an escaped death row inmate.

But just because I was found
guilty by Japanese law

doesn't mean you guys have
the right to judge me!

Josuke! I killed your grandpa,
but you have no right to kill me!

If you kill me, you'll end up
a cursed soul, just like me!

Don't go telling people what
they can and can't do.

M-M-My right hand! My hand!

No one's going to execute you.

Not me, and not Jotaro, either.

You're not going to be executed,

and you're not going back to jail.

Josuke, I'll leave the rest to you.

Wh-What do you plan to do
with me, you bastards?!

Repent for eternity, Angelo!

For all of those you killed,
including my Gramps!

You're gonna live forever in the
city my Gramps protected.

The Angelo Stone.

Yeah. The issue with Angelo's been resolved.

But I won't be coming back for a while.

That other photo we've been investigating...

Send it over, too.

Yeah, the one that the Speedwagon
Foundation found in Egypt ten years ago.

I think I might finally know what it means.

Please.

Yeah, thanks to him.

Josuke! I killed your grandpa,
but you have no right to kill me!

If you kill me, you'll end up
a cursed soul, just like me!

Don't go telling people what
they can and can't do.

M-M-My right hand! My hand!

You're not going to be executed,

and you're not going back to jail.

Josuke, I'll leave the rest to you.

Wh-What do you plan to do
with me, you bastards?!

Repent for eternity, Angelo!

For all of those you killed,
including my Gramps!

Damn it...

Don't you dare get cocky!

I'm sure he'll kill you both for me.

What? "He"?

That's right. The one wearing a school uniform,

who gave me this power.

What?

It can't be...

Are you saying someone can
willingly give another a Stand?

Are you scared?

Huh? How is that supposed to scare us?

No... Angelo's not a Stand user by birth.

It was a mystery how he
obtained his Stand powers.

But if there is actually a person
who can give others Stands...

Terrifying, isn't it?

Want me to tell you?

It was last year, so 1998,

on a night about a month
before my execution.

I couldn't sleep that night...

I was just staring blankly
up at the ceiling of my cell.

It was a completely silent night.

But then...

I should've been the only one in that dark cell,

but he was there.

The guy in the school uniform.

H-Hey! How long have you been there?!

Where'd you come from?!

Wha...

It was a very old bow and arrow.

It looked like it was centuries old.

Wh-What are you doing?

I was so scared, I could almost
feel my balls shriveling up.

But before I even had a chance to scream...

You're alive. Congratulations.

That means you've got the aptitude.
If you didn't, you'd be dead.

You've just obtained a talent.

No... It's more accurate to say
it was pulled from your mind.

The worse the villain, the more they have...

This talent that the man
named DIO called a "Stand."

DIO?

Did you say DIO?

Jotaro? Is something...

What?!

You fools!

It looks like you were so busy

listening to my story that you
forgot about my Aqua Necklace!

Angelo, you bastard!

Josuke! Hurry up and get me out of this rock!

It would appear that...

I didn't have enough rage in my heart for you.

What are you doing? Stop messing
with your stupid hair!

I'm gonna kill this brat!
Let me out right now!

What did you say...

Don't be rash, Josuke!

...about my hair?

Y-You know... If you kill me,

the guy in the school uniform won't let it slide!

He lives in this town, too!

What? Josuke, wait!

Ker-Blam

Yeah... I just didn't have enough rage earlier.

I needed to do a great job of burying
that asshole into the rock, like this.

Good grief.

I wanted to get a bit more out of him.

Huh? You actually believe
the crap he was saying?

It wasn't crap. He said DIO's name.

Who is that, anyway?

He's a man that the Joestar family has
been fighting for over a hundred years.

My friends and I fought DIO and defeated him.

But there was one thing
that I didn't understand.

Back in 1987, why did the man
called DIO suddenly acquire a Stand?

Could the same person
have made him a Stand user?

Yeah... The guy in the school
uniform might be our new enemy.

Or perhaps it's the bow and arrow he had.

If that's somewhere in this city...

Then it's hard to believe that
Angelo's the only danger here.

Good grief...

Morioh Town Report

Morioh Town Report

It's just like Jotaro said.

There's no doubt that the worst thing
imaginable is hiding in this city.

An extremely terrible danger
is coming to this city...

No, it's already begun.

Since the beginning of this year, 1999,
81 people have disappeared in Morioh.

Abductions & Kidnapping Cases

Of that number, 45 of them
were young boys and girls.

Even if some were runaways,

Have You Seen This Person?

that's still seven to eight times greater
than Japan's national average per city.

That number is extreme.

Not to mention...

Ryohei Higashikata Dead
(Morioh Police Officer)

Josuke's grandfather...

Koichi, you're even studying after school?

Let's go home.

Oh, right.

Thank goodness. Josuke
seems to be feeling better.

Yo, Angelo.

Uh... Huh? Hey, was this rock always here?

Yeah, but it didn't look like this at first.

At first?

Well, whatever. Yo, Angelo...

By the way, what happened to Jotaro?

Oh, he said he had something
he wanted to look into.

He's staying at the Grand Hotel.

Does it have to do with this city?

I'm sure it does.

I see.

The danger this city faces...

Huh? Josuke?

No one's lived in this house for
about three or four years, right?

Yeah. It's so run-down that
there's no way it'd sell.

It should be torn down and rebuilt.

No, someone's living here.
Maybe someone moved in?

There was someone in the window just now.

Huh? Nah, that can't be.
My house is over there, right?

I'd know right away if someone moved in.

Besides, realtors are always checking

to make sure homeless people don't crash there.

Now that you mention it, that's true.

How strange. I wonder if I actually saw a ghost...

H-Hey, don't say stuff like that.

Ghosts are scary! And we're
right in front of my house.

Stop gawking at my house, little brat.

Billion

Billion

Say something!

Koichi!

Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing?

What? That's my line.

You two are in front of my house...

Give it a rest.

If you're the newspaper guy,
I already told you we don't want it.

Who is it?!

My father just died of a stroke,

and we're still busy with
everything that follows.

Could you come back another time?

Y-You're...

Jo...

Joseph!

You finally came back, Joseph!

I was waiting for you this whole time!

I've been so sad and lonely since my dad died.

I can't believe you showed up
at a time like this, Joseph!

I love you, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you, I love you,

I love you, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you, I love you!

I hate to disappoint you,
but I'm not Joseph Joestar.

Huh?

Take a good look. No wrinkles.

Oh... Now that you mention it...

You're pretty young!

Good grief...

I'm Joseph's grandson. My name's Jotaro Kujo.

O-Oh, really?

Ask Josuke for the rest of the details.

I hate annoying conversations.

I'm here to see Josuke. Is he here?

I'm asking you where Josuke is.

Huh? Oh! Josuke hasn't come
home from school... yet.

I see... Then I'll be back tonight.

Huh?

You're leaving already?

Oh, yeah...

About your father...

Huh?

It's a shame.

If Joseph Joestar had come to this city,

he would have protected you as best
he could from the dangers to come.

But he's old now.

I can't let him come here.

I'm here in his place.

I just can't feel at ease.

The bow and arrow that
Angelo was talking about...

In documents the Speedwagon Foundation
obtained regarding the witch, Enyaba...

She's holding the bow and arrow.

They give ordinary people the power of a Stand.

Damn, that's unbelievable...

No Trespassing

Are you insane?

Let him go.

No Trespassing

My father bought this house.

Don't go digging around here.

Never do it again!

I'm not talking about that.

I'm telling you to let go of him, bastard.

If you don't let him go now,
I'm gonna get pissed off.

Come on, now. "Bastard" is a bit much, ain't it?

Calling someone you just met a bastard
right in front of their house...

Do you even know how to talk to people?

Well, I know how to shut that mouth of yours.

Stab

What?!

Bro?!

Do you wanna know why
I shot him with the arrow?

Because that guy is Josuke Higashikata.

Oh, really? He is?

Since he defeated Angelo,

that means he's a Stand user
who'll be trouble for us, too.

A Stand user?! You two are Stand users?!

Okuyasu! Make Josuke Higashikata disappear!

Koichi...

Hmph! I was hoping I could
make him into a Stand user

that I could use like the others,

but I guess that's not happening.

He's gonna die.

M-Move!

I can still heal his wounds
with my Shining Diamond!

No!

Josuke Higashikata! I, Okuyasu
Nijimura, will make you disappear

with my The Hand!

Here we go!

If you don't move, I'm seriously
going to mess up your face.

You're pretty fast.

Hey, Okuyasu.

Using a Stand is the same as
driving a car or riding a bike.

Dipshits with no skill or guts

will get scared and maneuver like crap,

no matter what kind of
monster machine they ride.

Bro...

Please don't say things
that'll piss me off too much.

This bastard's much faster than I thought.

We're not messing around here, Okuyasu!

The Stand that you acquired, The Hand,
gives me chills just thinking about it.

You'd better be serious when you use it.

Make sure you kill Josuke Higashikata,
who defeated Angelo, no matter what!

He's bound to get in our way.

I know—

Ah! I was talking!

Th-That's not fair!

You're pretty stupid, aren't you?

What? Why?!

Why do you think tha—

I told you to move.

Koichi!

Thank goodness. You're still alive.

Then I can still save...

That's it! You're gonna pay for that!

I told you to move!

Get any closer and you'll really piss me off!

Take your best shot, if you can!

He's got way too much
confidence in his right hand.

This isn't good.

I've got a really bad feeling
about that right hand of his...

Let go of my right hand, you little shit!

Yeah, it's his right hand!

Swoop

Why, you...

Don't you dare run away, Josuke!

Don't abandon your friend like that!

There's something up with
that right hand of yours.

Something's telling me it's not safe.

Think about that after you're dead!

Here I go!

Koichi... Just hang on a little longer...

No  passing

What's with that gate?
Something's wrong with it...

No... passing?

Stop walking backwards, you dumbass.

You're getting farther away from your buddy.

Come a bit closer!

That's it... The "tres" is missing.

I bet your Stand's right hand

scraped it off, right?

It has the power to scrape
away its surroundings.

No  passing

That's right, Josuke Higashikata!

Whatever this right hand
grabs gets scraped away.

And the parts that don't get scraped away...

close together, so it looks like nothing changed.

As for the part that gets scraped away...

Even I don't know where it ends up!

I can do this to guys who try to run away, too.

I scrape away the space between us! And then...

See? You came right to me.

You could call it teleporting!

This is the power of the Stand
even my bro fears, The Hand!

You can't run away anymore,

Josuke!

No matter where you go, you're...

always...

within my reach!

So weak!

You really beat Angelo like this?

I guess you just don't get that it's no use.

You're the one who's stupid!

Now die, Josuke!

You really are stupid, aren't you?

Why?!

Smack

Crash

Kaboom

That was close. Okuyasu Nijimura, huh?

That's a pretty great and terrifying Stand.

I'll be in trouble if he wakes
up and tries to attack.

I guess I should strangle him a bit,
just to make sure he stays knocked out.

It'll put the feeling of defeat in his soul, too.

One, and...

K-Koichi's...

That's enough, you bastard!

This arrow is very precious.
It's the only one there is.

It's my precious objective.

I just have to retrieve it.

According to Angelo's story,

it's this bow and arrow that
unleashed DIO's Stand powers.

There's no doubt about it.
That unleashed The World...

And after Enyaba died,
someone obtained the bow and arrow,

and is creating more Stand users in Morioh.

I've got to hurry and destroy
that bow and arrow...

To make sure a villain more evil than DIO

doesn't appear with a Stand
more powerful than The World.

Episode 4
The Nijimura Brothers, Part 2This arrow is very precious.
It's the only one there is.

It's my precious objective.

I just have to retrieve it.

Don't you dare pull out that arrow!
It'll make him bleed even more!

Because my little brother's an idiot,
I have to kill you now.

Which means it won't be good
if something happens to this arrow.

If the lady next door happens to see it,
or if it snaps in half, that'd be bad news.

I'm a very methodical type, you see,

so I want to make sure I put
the arrow away properly.

When you're listening to CDs, you properly
put the first one away in its case

before listening to the second one, right?

Everyone's like that.

I'm like that, too.

Oh? You're gonna come into this house?

Think before you speak!

If I don't come in, I can't kick
your ass and treat Koichi's wounds!

Bro! I haven't lost yet!

Hold off on attacking him!

Attack?

We ain't finished yet!

Something's coming from...

the darkness of the ceiling!

Episode 4  The Nijimura Brothers, Part 2

Okuyasu...

How stupid you are never ceases to amaze me.

If you hadn't come staggering in here,

my Worse Company would have
attacked Josuke for sure.

And you actually walked into
its attack trajectory.

Bro...

Your Stand, The Hand, is terrifying,
but you're completely incompetent.

I told you over and over,
ever since we were kids,

that incompetent people drag down
everyone around them, didn't I?

I told you over and over that people
only have the right to live

if they keep growing, didn't I?

What's with his injuries?

What kind of attack makes you
end up with wounds like that?

Anyway, it seems that something's up there.

Little brother,

I think it's only natural that
morons like you should die!

It left a ton of holes again!

What kind of attack is that?

Shining Diamond!

Are you trying to attack your brother, too?!

Josuke Higashikata...

I'm sure he won't abandon
this brat he called Koichi.

He'll most likely come in here again.

I'll kill him, no matter what...

I'll kill anyone who gets in the way
of this bow and arrow's objective,

no matter who they may be!

Now, then... How about you tell me
about your brother's Stand?

Tell me what his Stand really is!

If you tell me, I'll treat your wounds.

Like hell... I'm gonna tell you...

Dumbass...

As I thought.

Well, then... I guess I have no choice!

I'm gonna go in there again,
so just don't get in my way, Okuyasu.

Koichi doesn't have much time!

His Stand attacks from somewhere
within this darkness.

Going in here is pretty dangerous.

I've got no choice but to
use all of my senses fully...

Hey, wait a minute!

Huh?

Why, Josuke? Why did you treat my wounds?

Shut up. I'll tell you later.

I might attack you! I'm your enemy!

You want a piece of me?

After I hear your answer!
Why did you treat my wounds?

I'm not very smart,
so you're gonna have to tell me!

And that wound on your hand!

You got that when you were
pulling me outside, didn't you?

I wanna know why you went
through all that to save me.

There's no deep reason.

"There's no reason he has to die."

That's what I thought back there.

Koichi...

The trail leads upstairs.

I still have more questions, Josuke!

What's your problem?!

I'm begging you, just let me save Koichi!

Why?!

Why don't you use your Stand's
powers to fix your own hand?

You should just fix it up
like you did with my face.

My Shining Diamond can't
repair my own wounds.

It just means life isn't that easy.

And, more than anything,

I have no way of saving people
who've already died.

Let me just say one thing, Okuyasu.

If Koichi dies, I don't know what
I'm gonna do to your brother.

So don't hold it against me. It was your
brother who caused all this trouble.

You got that? If you do, stay outside.

Koichi!

Damn it... This is definitely a trap.

He plans to attack me from somewhere
as soon as I get close to Koichi.

But...

Even if I know it's a trap,
I have no choice but to go!

Koichi doesn't even have seconds left!

What?!

Okuyasu, you bastard!

Josuke!

Gyaon

Koichi just...

Because I'm stupid, I just
act on what's in my heart.

Just once, just this once,
I'll repay my debt to you.

I won't do anything else.

I won't help out my Bro,
or do anything to you, either.

This is it.

That's just great, Okuyasu.

Hey, you were in great danger, Koichi.

I'm glad you came to.

How many fingers am I holding up?

Five...

I-I got my head trapped between the gates,

and then, uh... um...

Wh-Where are we?

That dangerous situation we were
in earlier isn't over yet, Koichi.

I want to go down those
stairs and go outside,

but I wonder if Okuyasu's brother
will let us do that safely...

There's definitely something up there.

Something's lurking in the
shadows of the ceiling.

What's that?

Something really fast just went by.

Josuke, what's going on?

Koichi, I'm sure you have no
idea what's going on right now.

For now, don't ask any questions,
and get closer to me.

Earlier, it was creepy
because I couldn't see it,

but I feel a bit more at ease
now that I've seen it.

It just looks like a shrimp
with very little power.

This battle's gonna end with
me sending Shining Diamond

after that shrimp the next time it pops up.

There you are!

What the heck? There's a ton of them!

And that uniform...

Burn

Wh-What's...

A bunch of guys that look like
toy soldiers are falling...

Are these Okuyasu's brother's Stand?

Ow!

You bastard!

I guess attacking two or three
won't do enough damage.

And the wounds are small, but their
destructive power is the real thing.

We're sure to get seriously
hurt if we fight these things.

Since Okuyasu decided to meddle
and save that brat,

my plan's been derailed.

But they won't be leaving this house...

Nor will they leave my Stand,
Worse Company's, battlefield.

Wo

Wor

Worse

Worse Co

Worse Com

Worse Compa

Worse Company

Kei

Keicho

Keicho Niji

Keicho Nijimura

Worse Company?

Josuke, wh-what's...

Don't ask questions.

I'm sure you don't get it,
but just shut up and stay back!

We're in real trouble right now!

All units, halt!

Ready, aim...

Fire!

Left face!

Fire!

As I thought, that's enough
destructive power to blow off

our limbs if they hit us head-on!

Lucky! There are some windows.

Koichi, this is the second floor,

but we're gonna bust out
those windows and dive out.

I guess I was a bit naïve...

Just great... They have helicopters, too?

Those look like the American
army's Apache helicopters.

Look out! There's a tank!

You're right. They have tanks, too.

Koichi, be caref—

What?

Wh-What did you just say,
Koichi? Can you see them?

These soldiers, tanks, and helicopters...

You can see them clearly?

Yeah. I'm not sure what's
going on, but I can see them.

Could it be that since you were shot by
that arrow, you became a Stand user?

Oh? So the little shrimp

has the power to use a Stand now?

There you are, Okuyasu's big bro.

You've got some guts,
showing yourself like that!

My Stand, Worse Company,
has unbreakable defense.

It's an army that won't let
any invader leave alive.

I'm sure you want to beat me...

But I can tell you right now that
your Shining Diamond's attacks

will never reach me.

Look! Do you see my army's
beautiful formation?

All units, maintain battle
formation! At ease!

It feels so good when they're
so beautifully together.

Though I'm a bit pissed off
that their formation is

a little off, since you
killed two or three of them.

You sure are methodical.

You came out here just to explain that?

No, the reason I came out here

is to watch you, brat.

M-Me?

That's right.

Koichi, was it?

It seems, despite my expectations,
you had the aptitude to be a Stand user.

Make your Stand appear right now,
and show me what it can do.

You might have the ability
that I've been looking for.

If you have that ability, I'll let you live.

B-But...

The ability you're looking for?

What the hell are you after?

You're in no position to be
asking questions, Josuke!

My decision to kill you hasn't changed!

Be thankful that you get to live a bit longer.

That's just great.

Hey, what're you doing?

Make your Stand appear, brat!

S-Stand? I have no idea what's going on...

Oh? It's your first time? I see!

Fine! Josuke, show him how
to make a Stand appear!

Huh?

Your Shining Diamond's range
is less than one meter.

If that shrimp's Stand's ability
is able to compensate for yours,

you might be able to escape my Company.

True... It'd be great if it's a
Stand that can kick your ass.

Okay, getting your Stand to
come out is easy, Koichi.

You just need to feel like

you want to protect yourself,
or you want to kick his ass.

Huh?

The rest is just instinct.

A Stand that's unique to your
mentality should come out.

W-Wait! I can't understand
all this out of nowhere!

You don't understand?

Then I guess we'll just have to put
you in a situation that makes you!

Do it, Green Beret!

Boom

What?!

That's...

Hey, Koichi, try moving it.

M-Move what?

That Stand!

Stand?

I-I made this appear?!

What happens after this?

What kind of abilities does
this egg-shaped thing have?

Abilities? I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but this is all I can do!

This is it!

What? That's it?!

This Stand...

That's enough! That's all I need to know!

All units, battle positions!

Koichi, withdraw your Stand.

If they attack that thing, you'll die, too!

Withdraw? How do I make it withdraw?!

Commence attack!

Kablow

J-Josuke!

Good. Now Koichi and Josuke
have been separated.

The crack in that egg...

The brat hasn't realized it yet,
but it might be something worthwhile.

The only one who's going
to die right now is Josuke.

Ow...

Hey, Okuyasu's big bro,

if you're going to use an attack
flashy enough to destroy this house,

I'm gonna do the same.

Let's make this just great.

Josuke Higashikata...

Is it true that you hate it when anyone
says anything insulting about your hair?

Why don't you try insulting it?
Just to test that out.

No, there's no need.

Because I'm going to declare that I'll

blow off the head that your hair sits on.

First, my Worse Company is
going to shoot your legs.

You won't be able to run away then.

Next, we'll damage your arm.

Then you won't be able to guard yourself.

And then, I declare that I'm gonna blow
your brains out, along with your hair.

I see. That's a flawless plan...

If you ignore the fact that it's impossible!

I'm very methodical, you see.

If I say I'll do something
in a certain order, I will.

That's what a declaration is.

He's wide open...

I just need to make that
Stand thing appear again.

It's only an egg-looking thing,
but if I can make it ram into him,

I might be able to beat him!

I-I'm going to do it! Be confident!

I'm going to beat him!

I'm very interested in your Stand,

so I won't kill you just yet.

You bastard!

All units, charge!

Just like Moses, who parted the
Red Sea and walked across its floor,

I'm gonna make my way through
this army and beat you down!

You fool! My plan is going
exactly as I have declared,

Josuke Higashikata!

A l-landmine?!

First, damage to your legs!

And now, Apaches, fire your missiles!

My arm...

First your legs, then your arm.

It feels so good when
things go as I've declared.

Let's see if you can stay in
one piece as my Worse Company

fires all its missiles, shells, and rounds
into that damaged arm of yours!

You've lost, Josuke Higashikata!

All units!

Get ready to fire at once!

What do you think you're
doing, Josuke Higashikata?

Are you surrendering?

Are you asking me to let you go?

That's not happening.

All units, fire!

My plan is already finished.

What?!

My missiles that just attacked Josuke's arm...

Did you forget?

My Shining Diamond can repair
what's been destroyed.

If you forgot, then write it down.
You know, methodically.

Episode 5
The Nijimura Brothers, Part 3My plan is already finished.

What?!

Okuyasu's big bro was a pretty great danger.

Koichi, let's get the heck out of this house.

Huh?

Wh-What about the bow and
arrow that sh-shot me?

The bow and arrow?

Looks like Okuyasu's big
bro hid them somewhere.

Are we going to look for them?

Y-Yeah...

You know, I could swear they
mentioned having a dad around.

I took some pretty major damage,
so let's just leave for today.

W-We can't!

I-I'm alive because you healed
my wounds for me, but...

If someone else is shot with
that bow and arrow again,

they might actually die!

Here in this town!

S-Stay here. I-I'll go look for them myself!

N-Not to mention, I don't think
their dad is here right now.

I-If he was, I'm s-sure he would
have shown himself by now.

He's a lot braver than he looks.

He can be tough when it counts...
Or maybe just reckless.

But right now, we should really
hurry up and get out of this house.

Hey...

Wh-What? D-Don't try to stop me.

I won't.

Let's hurry up, snap that
bow and arrow in half,

and get the hell outta here together,

Koichi.

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

Diamond is Unbreakable

Episode 5  The Nijimura Brothers, Part 3

They have an attic. Maybe the
bow and arrow are up here.

Th-There they are!

The bow and arrow!

They're hanging on the far wall!

Hey, I think this was a bad idea.
There's something in there.

Is something chained up in there?

I-Is it a dog?

Those sounds can't be from a human...

I-It sounds like an animal.

No, I'm scared! What should we do?!

What should we do?

It was you who insisted on going!

Yeah, but...

We're just gonna have to do this.

Listen up, Koichi.

You're gonna kick in the door as hard
as you can on the count of three.

We're gonna scare it.

Then, I'm gonna run over and
snap the bow and arrow in half.

Got it?

Yeah.

Here we go.

One...

Two...

Three!

Grab

What the hell is that?!

Koichi!

Help!

That hand doesn't belong to a Stand. It's real!

That's a real body!

H-Help me!

Bleh...

I didn't mean to chop it off...

Wh-What the heck is that creature?

I can't believe that thing's
been living near my house...

Bleh...

Looks like you finally saw the
thing you weren't supposed to see.

You bastard...

That thing right there... is our dad.

My dad needs these.

Th-The bow and arrow...

I want to find a Stand user for my dad's sake.

That's why I can't let anyone else

have this bow and arrow or destroy them,

no matter what!

Is it some kind of disease?

Disease? No.

My dad's perfectly healthy,

and he's got an appetite.

But he just keeps moaning, and he
doesn't recognize me as his son.

So you were looking for a
Stand user to fix your dad.

Fix?

You gonna fix him for me?
That's not it, either.

It's the opposite.

I'm looking for a Stand user who'll kill my dad.

Dad won't die, no matter what.

Whether you smash his head in,

or grind up his body, or rip
things off, nothing works!

I just want to let him die normally.

I swore when I was a kid that I'd do
anything to make that happen.

And to do that, I need this bow and arrow.

Otherwise, my dad will probably
live like this forever.

Because my dad had some
guy named DIO's cells

implanted in his head,
so he ended up like this!

DIO? Did you just say DIO?

That's the guy Jotaro talked about.

Let me tell you a bit about the past,

Josuke Higashikata.

After all, you're not completely uninvolved.

Everything happened eleven
years ago, in 1988.

At the time, I was seven,
and Okuyasu was four.

We lived in Tokyo.

The world was carefree,
thanks to the bubble economy,

but at the time, my dad had no luck.

Our mom died of an illness,

the business that my dad
was running went under,

Luxury Houses
Nijimura Land

and he was in massive debt.

He would hit us for no reason all the time.

Our dad was a total loser.

But then, suddenly,

money started rolling in to my dad.

Even jewels and precious
metals, too, sometimes.

He wasn't even really working.

I found out later when I did some research

that my dad had apparently
already sold his soul to DIO.

He became one of his minions
in exchange for money.

It seems that DIO was looking for anyone
with Stand potential back then.

Somehow, he found out that
my dad had the potential,

though I have no idea now
what his Stand was like.

But one day... Even though it was ten
years ago, I still remember it vividly.

When I got home from school, around 2:00 PM...

Okuyasu!

Did Dad hit you again? That scum!

N-No!

Huh?

DIO...

DIO's dead...

That has to be why!

Dad?

Dad, let's call an ambulance.

It's no use! This isn't an illness!

The flesh bud has gone berserk!

I'm done for!

Dad!

About a year after that, he became
a glob of flesh that can't even tell

that we're his sons anymore.

DIO would implant his own cells into
the heads of those he couldn't trust,

and order them around when
he wanted to control them.

Dad had one of those flesh buds
implanted in his head.

I spent ten years researching everything.

About Stands, about Jotaro...

Then I found out about the
old woman named Enyaba,

and obtained the bow and arrow.

But as I learned all of this,

I also had to accept that
my dad would never recover.

Because DIO's immortal cells
had become one with him.

This is all he does, all day long.

Every single day...

Day after day, for ten years,

he uselessly scratches
around that box of junk.

If I take the box away from him,
he just cries for days.

It pisses me off.

Watching him just makes me
hate the idea of living.

How many times have I told
you not to make a mess?

He can be obedient if I discipline him,

but he never stops digging
around in that box!

Bleh...

Hey! You're the one who needs to stop!

He's your dad!

Yeah, that's right.

He's my father by blood.

But right now, he's as much
my father as he's not.

He's a man who sold his soul to DIO,
and got what he deserved.

Yet, on the other hand,

do you know how it feels, not being able
to finish him off because he's your dad?

That's exactly why I want him to die normally.

Once he's finally dead,
my life can actually begin!

Damn it! I told you to stop that!

It pisses me off!

Hey!

That's enough!

I can't let you have this bow and arrow.

No matter what!

Don't get the wrong idea!

I'll worry about the bow and arrow later.

Right now, that box has my attention!

Dogyaa

Do

Th-The box?

gyaa

I saw him grabbing at some paper scraps,

so I was curious about what it was.

I see now.

A family photo...

S-So there was a reason.

There was a reason for the
behavior he repeated for ten years.

He was looking for the photo
of his sons at the time.

He might not understand
what's going on right now,

but deep down inside,
he still has his memories!

Memories of the past!

The

The Ha

The Han

The Hand

Oku

Okuyasu

Okuyasu Niji

Okuyasu Nijimura

Instead of looking for a Stand to kill him,

if you'll try to find one that can cure him,

I don't mind helping you out.

But hand over that bow and arrow.

I'm gonna snap them in half.

You planning to run?

Big Bro, let's stop this.

Okuyasu!

Come on, let's stop all of this, okay?

You were still here?

Dad might get cured, right?

Even if his body doesn't go back to normal,

maybe his mind and his memories
will go back to how he used to be.

Right?

Okuyasu! What do you think you're holding?

Big Bro...

Out of the way, Okuyasu!

I can't turn back anymore,
no matter what happens!

I've already killed so many people in
this city with this bow and arrow!

Besides, I don't even think of you
as my little brother anymore.

Since you're not my little brother,
I can kill you without hesitation!

B-Big Bro...

You guys...

Do you have any relatives
here besides your dad?

Relatives? There's only the three of us.

Th-That's...

It came out of the electrical outlet...

Okuyasu! Stop spacing out, you dumbass!

Big Bro!

I'm taking this bow and
arrow, Keicho Nijimura!

I, who got shot by this bow and arrow,
and had my Stand ability awakened!

You think...

someone like you can handle
this bow and arrow?

Keicho Nijimura!

You said Stands depend on
one's mentality, didn't you?

Well, I've grown!

How else do you think my Stand,
Chili Pepper, grew this much?

Worse Company!

Shut up!

Th-That's...

Electricity!

Okuyasu's big brother is being
turned into electricity,

along with the bow and arrow!

Big Bro!

Don't touch me!

You'll be dragged in, too!

Big Bro...

D-Damn it! It's taking the bow and arrow!

Okuyasu...

You were always holding me back!

Big Bro!

Josuke!

I could have sworn I just saw
someone who looked like

the user looking in through that window.

Do you know anything about
that Stand we just saw, Okuyasu?

N-No. My big bro found a lot of
Stand users I didn't know about.

J-Josuke! Th-That's...

Okuyasu...

My big bro... deserved to end up like that.

There's no way he could
have lived a decent life.

That was his fate.

But you know...

In the end, my big bro...

In the very end, my big bro
defended me, didn't he?

Josuke, you saw it, right?

Yeah. I definitely saw it.

Your big bro defended you.

Is this Jotaro Kujo?

I don't recognize your voice.

Who are you?

That doesn't matter.

Jotaro Kujo, I'm asking
you to leave Morioh.

I don't think I'll listen to someone

I don't know suddenly telling me to leave.

Would you leave, no questions asked,
if you were in my shoes?

I'm the one who has the bow and arrow.

I got it after I killed Keicho Nijimura.

I don't mind killing you either,
Jotaro, but I hear that

you have the ability to stop
time for a second or two.

You sound like a tough opponent,

so I thought I'd give you
a call and warn you first.

Are you also Stand user?

What do you plan to do
with the bow and arrow?

I don't plan on giving you any trouble.

And as long as Josuke Higashikata
doesn't try anything,

Unavailable Number  Public Phone

I won't do anything to him, either.

I just received this Stand ability.

I just want to have a little fun.

I'm fed up with my annoying life of
entrance exams and getting a job.

Are you a student?

What difference does that make?!

Listen! If you overstay
your welcome in my city,

I'm gonna kill you and Josuke, too! Got it?!

How many other Stand users are in this city?

Good grief...

Keicho Nijimura was buried
in Kunimi Peak Cemetery,

which is west of Morioh.

The stolen bow and arrow remain missing.

Nijimura Family

Okuyasu Nijimura decided to settle down

with his father in Morioh for a while.

And...

Josuke, would you get that?

Yes?

Hey, Josuke! Let's go to school.

Huh?

I'll be going to the same school
as you starting today.

Even so, you don't have to come and get me.

We're not in grade school.

Man, I had no idea your house was,
like, right in front of mine!

Yeah, you could call that a shocking truth...

Come on. Let's hurry up and go.

Oh, is that a friend of yours, Josuke?

Hi! I'm Okuyasu Nijimura!

Come on in and have a cup of coffee
while he finishes getting ready.

Really? Thank you very much!

Your mom is totally hot.

Pardon the intrusion!

This is just great... and heavy...

Your host, once again, is me,
your neighbor, Kai Harada.

Now, then...

Look at those smooth spokes
shining as they spin!
Last week's topic was, "The King of Terror is
supposed to come from the sky this July.

This mountain bike was a gift to
celebrate me getting into high school.

What are the citizens of
Morioh going to do?"

Getting new stuff is always exciting.

All right, let's get to the replies.

This one's from "RIP Big Bro."
I'm not gonna be able to take
the bus to school for a while!

I wonder what happened to his big bro?

O-Ow...

Wh-What the heck?

There's a bag in the middle of the road.

I-It can't be! The thing in that bag was...

Wh-What am I gonna do?! I ran it over!

I-I couldn't help it!

It was in the middle of the road!

There was nothing I could've done!

Precisely.

You're not the one at fault here.

That was just an unfortunate accident.

The guy who put the kitten in a bag
and left it in the road is at fault.

Talk about a terrible thing to do.

W-We have to treat its injuries!

It's no use.

You don't hear it crying, do you?

It's dead.

What's your name?

My name's Tamami Kobayashi,
and I graduated from

your school two years ago.

That's a nice bike.

You a first-year?

Y-Yes. My name's Koichi Hirose.

Ah, high school, eh? Takes me back.

Things were good back then.

Well, have a seat, Hirose.

Huh? B-But...

Just shut up and sit down.

So... I've got an idea.

I'll bury that cat for you,

so give me a little money. Okay?

Hey! Are you listening?!

Wh-What are you talking about?

Hey, now. Quit messing around.

It's true that this wasn't your fault,

but are you planning to do
nothing about killing my cat?

Did you say it was your cat?

That's right.

Y-You put the kitten o-over there?

That's not the problem anymore.

I'm asking you if you're really
gonna do nothing about it and go.

You're the one that killed it, bro.

Episode 6  Koichi Hirose (Reverb)

Hey, you're feeling guilty, right?

If your heart could be freed

from the shackles of guilt by paying some cash...

Wouldn't it be better to just pay up?

Right?

Money

Wh-What's this lock-looking thing?!

It's heavy!

Huh? You can see that?

Then this should go even faster, Hirose.

Th-This is a Stand!

A Stand's inside my body!

Hey, Josuke.

Isn't that Koichi standing over there?

Yeah, that's definitely Koichi.

That kid hangs out with shady-looking
characters all the time.

But he looks like he's having fun.

I met a guy named Keicho Nijimura
about four months ago,

and obtained this ability.

I had no idea what was going on,
but man, I was happy.

I figured that if I could
use this ability properly,

it could support me for the rest of my life.

Now...

Come on, cough it up.

These shackles won't come
off if you don't pay up.

I-I don't...

have any money.

Huh... You looked away just now, didn't you?

W-Well...

I-It's heavy!

I can't even stand anymore!

Tsk, tsk, tsk.

It's not nice to lie, you know.

You felt bad about lying, didn't you?

The more guilt you feel,
the bigger the lock becomes.

These shackles are the weight of your sins.

It's automatic.

Even if I'm sleeping, or if you try to
run far away, it's never coming off.

All right? If you get it,
then show me your wallet.

Come on.

What the heck? You should have just
given me this in the first place.

You have 7,000 yen!

Th-That's for buying sneakers
for gym class today.

Sneakers?

Go barefoot!

What are you doing over there?

J-Josuke and Okuyasu!

A grown man trying to threaten
a high school kid for money?

Try getting a job to earn your money.

Now, look! You little boys stay out of this!

Oh, we can't do that.

Not when there's some smelly trash
around, using some petty Stand.

We've got to take out that trash properly.

Hey...

This seriously isn't coming off.

Whoa, wait... You guys can see it, too?

Just how many of you can see that?

That's what I want to know.

But right now, that doesn't matter.

Would you kindly take that lock off of him?

Hey, you little brats!
Don't underestimate me!

I'm not playing games here!

Sinners must pay for their sins.
That's the rule of society.

Or what? You're going to
pay me instead of Koichi?

Then I'll let you off the hook.

Money's money to me.

Oh? You're gonna try to get money from me?

Just try it, damn it!

Wait! You just took 7,000 yen for me!

That was the fee for lying to me!

Huh?!

You're trying to pay for that poor
kitten's life with just 7,000 yen?

That just won't do.

I'll take about five hundred grand for that.

Five hundred grand?!

Come on, five hun—

Shut up, you little shit!

O-Okuyasu!

Hey, don't push it.

Shut yer trap, you dumbass.

We told you to give his 7,000 yen
back, so give it back, you dipshit!

Slip

O-Ow! My front tooth!

Wh-Why the hell did you wobble around
and fall over on your own?

On my own? That's so cruel!

How dare you say that after hitting me?!

My front tooth's gone. You're so cruel!

H-Hey, wait a sec... Are you okay?

Wait, Okuyasu...

Don't feel any guilt toward him!

H-He did it on purpose!

Front teeth are pretty expensive, you know...

Since I don't have insurance.

Wh-Why, you...

Whoa, now! Don't try anything funny with me.

If anyone who's got my lock on them
tries to damage me in any way,

it goes right back to that lock.

Y-You bastard...

Hey. Is the kitten that
you said Koichi ran over

this thing?

A s-stuffed animal?

Here, let me see. I picked
up your front tooth for you.

It's all better.

It's gone!

Yay! My heart feels so much lighter now!

Wh-Who the hell are you?!

Hey, aren't you forgetting the 7,000 yen?

All right! I'll give it back.

Once the money's down, hurry up
and get out of here, dumbass!

I-I'm saved... Ah!

Th-The bills... H-He took them!

He took the big parts that
the bank would exchange!

Th-That bastard...

Unforgivable! Even if it's not my money.

Damn. I was only able to get 7,000 yen.

Don't think you're gonna get away with that.

Just you wait.

Aw, man...

My day started off with something
terrible, so I was down the whole day.

I'm home, Police.

Hey, you alive? Woof, woof.

I'm home.

I've heard all about you around town, ma'am.

They say you're beautiful, kind, and so refined.

You can't be serious.

I wouldn't lie!

Really?

Of course!

Wh-Why is he in my house
rubbing my mom's shoulders?!

The

The Lock

Tama

Tamami

Tamami Koba

Tamami Kobayashi

Y-You!

What are you doing here?!

Oh, Ko, you're back. Hi!

I-I asked you wh-what you were doing here!

This gentleman delivered
the money you dropped.

Huh?!

Seven thousand yen.
You must've been in a hurry.

Th-This money... You told her you found it?

That's right. You ran into Mr. Kobayashi
on your bike today, didn't you?

Wha...

I made sure you got your money back, Koichi.

A-And you should have!

Ko, why are you so worked up?

Ma'am, this is hard for me to say,

but it appears that I dropped my wallet
when we ran into each other, too.

It looks just like this one.

Which means our wallets got swapped.

Do you understand what I'm saying, ma'am?

Y-Yes, though that seems very unusual.

But I guess it's possible.

So I'd like you to tell Koichi
to return my wallet to me.

It had about five hundred thousand yen in it.

Please tell him to give it back to me.

What?!

F-Five hundred thousand?!

So that's it!

I see your scheme now!

K-Ko...

Don't panic! He's a con artist!

They're all lies!

Oh, that's right.

I can prove that our wallets got switched.

Last night, I had a
hamburger combo at Jonny's.

And... Oh, yes. I added an
order of onion gratin soup...

So I believe the total on
the receipt was 1,833 yen.

It should be tucked away
in the wallet Koichi has.

K-Ko!

N-No! Mom, please believe me!

This is a trick!

You did this earlier, didn't you?!

And then you went out of your
way to buy a similar wallet!

I hate to say this, but your son, though
I'm sure it's just a phase, is pretty rotten.

Don't you feel guilty as his mother

for raising a son like that?

Stop!

M-Mom!

I finally did it!

Now the weight of her guilt
won't allow her heart to be free.

I'm gonna take you for everything you've got.

First, I'll take this house's land, title, and seal.

What a great house this is.

Koichi,

is something wrong?

Sis!

Wh-What?!

Earlier, when she brought me tea,
I made her spill some on my hand,

and then acted like it really burned.
She kept apologizing so much.

She was so cute and sexy.

So she's a third-year at a girls' school?

R-Ripe for the picking.

A-A-Awesome!

How dare you?

You won't get away with this! I won't let you!

What the hell?

What's up with that puny egg thing?

What the hell is that?!

Mom, Sis, please leave the room for a while.

Ko, what's happening?

Please, don't ask any questions now.

Hey! K-Keep that thing away from me!

Your mom and sister leaving the room

doesn't change the fact that
th-they're my hostages!

I won't let you harm my mom or sister.

J-Just try it, Koichi! Just try!

Take the locks off of them!

If your mom sees you beating
the crap out of me,

her guilt is just gonna grow more and more!

I told you to take them off!

Don't underestimate Tamami
Kobayashi, you pissy little shit!

L-Like hell I'll take them off!

Crack!

Huh? What?

That didn't hurt.

Huh?

Smack!

Whoa! What's this?

The sound is impressive,
but it's actually super weak!

What the hell is with your Stand?

It doesn't have any speed or power at all!

How dare you scare me
like that, you dumbass?!

I'll show you that a Stand's strength
comes from how strong you are mentally!

Crack!
Which means your mental strength is zero!

I'm gonna make sure you pay dearly for this!

S-Something strange is
going on with his cheek!

"Cr-ack"?

It looks like a manga sound effect.

Crack!

Crack!
Crack!
Crack!

Wh-What the heck? I hear a
weird ringing in my ears!

Like the sound I heard when I got hit...

Smack

What the hell is this writing on my arm?!

I-It won't come off!

Smack!
Smack!
Smack!

Crack!
Crack!
Crack!

Smack!
Smack!
Smack!
Crack!
Crack!
Crack!

W-Wait... Th-These sounds that
I hear coming from inside me...

Your Stand did that?!

Damn it! Get rid of this sound!

Smack

Boom!

Boom!
Smack!
Crack!

It's the sound.

My Stand makes the sound
resonate from inside his body.

C-Come to think of it, there was that famous
Basho Matsuo poem I learned at school...

So quiet and still
The shrill of the cicadas
Seeps into the rocks

"So quiet and still,

the shrill of the cicadas

seeps into the rocks."

Smack!
Crack!
Boom!

Damn it! I totally fell for it!

If you take the locks off my mom
and sister, I'll stop the sound.

If you keep resisting,

even I don't know what will happen to your body.

Stop this sound!

Dogyaa

Stop being stubborn and take off those locks!

Damn it! How dare you do this to me?!
Smack!
Crack!
Boom!
Dogyaa!

Like I could threaten and con if I was
afraid of a little brat like you!

The "Tama" in my name means "ballsy"!
I'll show you just how ballsy I am!

I'm not scared of some knife!

Don't take me lightly!

I'll show you how terrifying I can be!

The true fear of the locks!

Ow!

What?!

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

Make the cut shallow, and scream like hell!

Toss!

"Toss"?

What was that scream?

What's wrong?

Ko?!

I-It's not what it looks like!

C-Crap!

Yes!

K-Ko! How could you do
something so terrifying?!

No, Mom! t's not what it looks like!

No!

Sis!

I win! You lose!

Hurry up and stop this sound, Koichi!

If you don't stop this sound,

your mom won't be able to
bear the weight of her guilt.

When humans can't bear the
weight of their sins anymore,

they think they'd be better off dead.

I-I can't... anymore!

Mom!

I can't live any longer!

Stop acting tough!

Hurry and stop this sound! Are you
gonna let your mom kill herself?!

No, I won't stop the sound.

I'll do the opposite, and make more sound!

Believe in me!

Believe in me!

Believe in me!

What?!

!em ni eveileB

Believe in me, Mom!

Believe in me!

Believe!

Mom!

Believe in me!

Believe in me!

This is a matter of the soul!
Like hell she'll believe you!

Mom...

He's right... If I, his own mother,
won't believe in him,

then who will?

Koichi's always been a nice boy.

He would never hurt anyone
or take their money.

Yes!

Sh-Shit!

Mom!

D-Damn it!

Usually, they'd never believe...

My parents would never believe in me!

Gulp...

It was just a joke!

Ko, it was all just a joke!

Take the lock off my sister, too.

It's already off!

We can't do anything to harm her beauty, right?

I was only kidding about taking your house!

I even gave back your 7,000 yen,
didn't I? Right? Right?

Please forgive me!
I'll do anything, Master Koichi!

What? You'll do anything?

Yes, Master Koichi! Anything!
I'll be your underling!

All right, then...

Make sure you bring me five
hundred grand by tomorrow.

It's a joke. It's only a little joke.

Th-That didn't sound like a joke!

H-Hey, Okuyasu! What the
hell is going on here?

Allow me to carry your bag to school!

You're seriously going to carry it?

But of course!

Master Koichi! You're a true man among men!

Oh, stop it.

Hey, Okuyasu!

Don't ask me! I'm not smart, remember?

Our first letter is from
"Forever 21, Pretty Baby."

I was late meeting someone
because of that thing again.

Yeah, the one by the station!

The railroad crossing that
never lets you through.

Ugh, it just goes ding, ding, ding, ding,

Now, calm down, Pretty Baby.

Oh...

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

Diamond is Unbreakable

See ya.

Seriously?

Episode 7  Toshikazu Hazamada (Show Off)

There are Stand users besides us at this school?

Yeah. He's Toshikazu Hazamada,
a student in class 3-C.

This Hazamada guy apparently got into

an argument over something silly with a
friend right around the start of spring.

One of them had insulted the other's
favorite idol or anime or something.

That night, surprisingly, the friend
he got into the argument with

gouged out his own left eye
with a mechanical pencil.

Isn't that insane?

Apparently Hazamada's friend
said this at the hospital:

"Next thing I knew, I was staring at my left eye,
which I'd gouged out, with my right eye."

So you're saying that this guy gouged out

his left eye using some kind of a Stand?

Could be, but maybe not.

Normal people can't see Stands.

Something about this is really fishy.

What'd you say?!

Josuke, you've got no right to criticize me.

I've got a real job now, y'know!

Huh? You've got a job?

Yes, Master Koichi! I found myself a
little job that involves financing.

Financing?

You don't mean you became a loan shark, do you?

Well... It's a very reputable
establishment, though!

Still, though, we can't just ignore this.

Wait up, Josuke!

M-Master Koichi!

Are you going, too?

Just leave it to that idiot Josuke.

There's something scary going on in my town.

If Morioh is in danger,
that means my parents, my sister,

and everyone else important to me
will have to face that danger.

So even if it's scary, I gotta do something!

Wh...

What a tough thing to say.

Nothing less from the man I've chosen to admire!

But...

I'll be heading home now!

Be safe, Master Koichi!

Yeah, totally.

Looks like he's not in the classroom.

But if that Hazamada guy really
did gouge out his friend's eye

and can still blend into normal school life...

He must be one creepy guy.

Hazamada

H-Hey, Josuke!

I'm gonna check out his locker.
Watch my back, Koichi.

Tell me first before you break it!

For starters... His bag is still here.

So he's still at school. Be careful.

R-Right.

So he's in the tennis club and likes manga.

Still, this guy's got way too much stuff.

I don't think the bow and arrow
would be in here, but...

What's this wooden thing?

A Sta—

N-No... This is a physical object.

Is this one of those dolls they sell
at art stores for sketching?

It scared me...

Huh?!

What? Why?!

It turned into me when I touched it.

But now we know for sure...

Hazamada is a Stand user!

This is just great. You've got
some nerve, turning into me!

You've heard of Perman, right?

I-It talked! It sounds and talks just like him!

You know the copy robot from Perman?

Isn't that thing convenient?

Don't you think it'd be great to have one around?

Hey, Koichi. What is he talking about?

What the hell is Perman?

You haven't heard of Perman?!
I can't believe it.

And you call yourself Japanese?

Shut up! I'm the one asking the questions here!

M-My arm!

Josuke!

But mine is a copy doll that replicates
people I don't want around.

Once it copies you, you'll
mimic all of its movements.

Which means it's not a puppet,

but a puppet master!

K-Koichi! Move!

Crunch

Koichi!

And one rag's been hung out to dry.

Oh, but I'm not the one who did it.
The one who did it was you, his friend.

Stuff like this

pisses me off more than anything.

When you don't do anything yourself,

but use others to do things for you.

That makes me want to kick
your ass like nothing else!

That's just great. Tee-hee!

Looks like you're out of range.

If you can't move from that spot,
your Stand can't get any closer, either.

Which means if I maintain this distance,

Josuke, you stand no chance against me!

This Stand's name is Show Off.

By possessing a doll,
it has gained a physical form...

Which means even normal people can see it.

Hazamada! You bastard!

My goal is to beat the shit out of Jotaro Kujo

and run him out of this city.

He's got some nerve!

An outsider, coming here and
trying to dig up dirt on us...

But I heard that his Star Platinum
can stop time for a second or two.

There's no one in our group that
stands a chance against him.

That is, no one besides my Show Off,
now that it's copied you, Josuke!

I'll have to knock you out now.

The genuine article would just be in the way.

Squish!

Crushed, huh? That's a satisfying sound.

As long as you didn't cut the nerve,
you'll be able to see again...

If you're lucky.

Looks like he's gonna be out for a while.

That was super easy.

Hey! Pick up my bag.

We're gonna go straight after Jotaro.

Easy enough.

I'm pretty sure the hotel that
Jotaro's staying at is...

Squish!

Squish!

Uh...

The Morioh Grand Hotel.

Yeah, that's the one.

K-Koichi!

Koichi!

J-Josuke, are you okay?

Th-Thanks... But man,
you've really got some guts.

Even though you're hurt, you managed
to use your Stand to trick him.

What are you talking about?

That's only because,

as soon as I got hit, you fixed my
broken bones with Shining Diamond.

And, uh...

I'd appreciate it if you could fix the
injuries I got from breaking down

the door and window right after that, too.

R-Right!

Hello, this is the Morioh Grand Hotel.

Oh, uh, could you put me through
to Jotaro Kujo in Room 324?

Certainly.

Ugh! We have to hurry up and
tell Jotaro about that Stand!

Thank you for waiting.

The line for Room 324 is currently in use.

Please wait until the
current call is completed.

The line's in use?

What?!

Of course! It must've been the copy!

It called him before I did!

Are you certain, Josuke?

There's another Stand user at your school?

Yup! I'll tell you the details at Morioh Station.

Please come to the station plaza.

You should be able to get
there in fifteen minutes.

All right. In front of the
station in fifteen minutes.

Too easy.

I-It's no use! He's not answering.

He must have left the room.

They must have lured him out
to meet them somewhere!

Damn it! We're just gonna
have to go after the copy!

I really couldn't tell the difference
between you and the copy.

Yeah. What really creeped me out

wasn't when I saw its face.
It was the fingers.

You see your fingers more often
every day than your face, right?

I could tell that it had copied me
right down to my fingerprints.

Oh!

Josuke, you're early.

Where's Master Koichi?

H-Hazamada?!

What are you doing here?

Tamami Kobayashi?

You don't know why we're together?

N-No, I don't...

No idea at all?

No idea! Why?!

Then...

Good!

Hurry, please.

We've got to hurry and
catch up with Hazamada,

or Jotaro's gonna be in trouble!

Bye-bye, Josuke!

See you tomorrow!

Bye!

Josuke!

Bye, Josuke!

Why the hell are you the
only one they say goodbye to?

I've never had anyone say that to me.

All the girls in this school are ugly, anyhow.

Josuke...

Hey, read this.

B-Bye.

Why the hell did you accept that?
Rip this stupid thing up!

Damn it... What the hell is the
difference between you and me?

Why does that even matter?

Wha...

You don't have any time to waste, do you?

Who the hell do you think you're talking to?!

Ow!

You scraped your hand? That was dumb.

I'm made of wood, remember?

Shut up! Get away from me!

Damn it, I'm getting pissed off.

It's my own Stand, but this happens every time.

The other day, I had it copy my crush, Junko,

but I got pissed off because it
kept doing things to piss me off,

so I never even got anywhere.

Doesn't anyone in this world have
a decent personality? Damn it!

That stupid Josuke!

I'll hurry up and take care of Jotaro first,

then I'll crush him to bits!

I can't wait!

My bike!

It's dirty.

Damn it, that dumbass! I'll kill him!

Hey, it's not like he meant it. And he'll hear you.

Like I care! That's exactly why I said it.

Wobbling around like that...

Man, he looks like a dying cricket.

That's a good metaphor! I like it!

Yeah? It was a good description, huh?

Huh? What?

Hold him, Show Off.

I'll carve him up myself.

Wh-What are you doing?

You don't have to worry about that.

I'm just going to make sure

that you'll never be able
to open your mouth again.

S-Stop!

A shard of glass?

J-Josuke Higashikata?!

Why... And the shrimp, too?

Hazamada!

We finally caught up with you, asshole!

But did you already forget?

When you come face to face with
Show Off, you become a puppet, Josuke!

Control him, Show Off!

Don't be so sure about that.

Wha... That shape...

I didn't throw that shard to hit you.

I threw it so I could put it
back in its original form!

Swoosh

M-My right hand!

It turned back into wood!

This isn't good, Hazamada!

Calm down!

Just pretend you have
your hand in your pocket!

No one will notice!

The real problem is

that Jotaro should arrive at the station soon!

I'm shocked that Josuke was safe,

but let's give up on beating him right now!

H-Hazamada! Wait for me!

I see...

So they're meeting him in front of the station.

J-Josuke, we have no time to waste!

The way they went is the fastest
way to get to the station!

And that's why I've got you, Koichi.

Looks like Josuke's not here yet.

Can you see Josuke anywhere?

Nope.

If I see any sign of him,
I'll just take control of him.

Don't worry!

Ding Ding Ding Ding

Hazamada! A train's coming through.

The railroad crossing that
never lets you through!

We'll have to wait a minute or two...

All right. We'll go through the station building.

Emergency
Stop
Button
No Crossing

Even if he catches up with us,
the train will stall Josuke!

Just one more minute!

I'll head over to the meeting spot first!

I won!

Huh?

That's Josuke!

Wh-What happened to the train?!

Why's the crossing open?!

Hazamada, look!

Wh-What the hell is that Stand?!

Ding Ding Ding Ding

That was great! You see?
That's why I said I've got you.

Ah! There he is!

J-Jotaro! It's me, Josuke!

Hey.

We made it in time!

We got Hazamada good, didn't we, Josuke?

Did something happen?

A copy?

A Stand that copied you
down to your fingerprints?

That's right!

There would have been trouble
if he'd gotten here before me.

But now we can relax.

That copy bastard is missing
his right hand, so it'll be easy.

I blew off his right hand.

Use that to tell us apart.

All right.

They should get here at any moment.

Huh? Why do I have this thing?

Why did I get a pen out of Jotaro's pocket?

I-I can't move!

My arm just stopped moving on its own.

O-On the other side of the glass...

Th-That's...

Josuke Higashikata...

You're gonna stab Jotaro in the head
with that pen and kill him instantly.

After all, if his death isn't instant,
your Shining Diamond will just fix him.

Josuke! This is your fault
for getting outta line!

I was just gonna halfway kill Jotaro
to chase him out of town.

But now you're the one who'll kill Jotaro!

It'll be all your fault!

Now! Let him have it, Show Off!

J-Jotaro...

You bastard!

Something wrong, Josuke?

Huh? No...

Looks like those guys finally found Hazamada.

You little shit!

You were just across the pedestrian bridge
at the station, just like that Josuke said.

He's a great guy.

He treated our wounds, and I'm not
even sure how, but they're all better!

I'll make sure I pay you back in full for earlier.

Let's take a little trip behind the restroom.

That Stand is pretty
terrifying if it catches you.

Well, I guess I'll break this doll now.

It'll make me feel better.

Meanwhile, unknown to anyone else,

Tamami was admitted to the hospital.

What a fool!

Well, you have my condolences.

Episode 8
Yukako Yamagishi Falls In Love, Part 1

Episode 8
Yukako Yamagishi Falls In Love, Part 1So that guy, Hazamada, says

he doesn't know anything
about the electric bastard

that killed my big bro?

Yeah. He said he's only ever
talked to him on the phone.

And you believed him, Josuke?
Did you torture him?

If Hazamada actually knew who that guy was,

he would probably have
already come to silence him.

R-Right... Just like my big bro.

Yeah. Seeing as how Hazamada is alive,
that proves he really doesn't know.

But Hazamada did say this...

Stand users, for some reason, seem to
be unknowingly drawn to one another,

even if they don't know each other.

They say that you're bound to
the person that you're going

to marry by the red string of fate, right?

It's sort of like that.

You just end up eventually meeting them.

They might be an enemy, a friend,
the guy who steps on your foot on the bus,

or someone who just moved in next door.

You just don't know.

Morioh's not very big...

I don't know how many Stand
users are in this town right now,

but no matter how they try to hide,
they'll eventually show themselves.

He knows that's going to happen eventually.

He wants you to disappear.

Damn it.

What a coward.

He needs to attack us already!

But that also means that he's cautious.

When guys like that attack,

it's probably only when they're
certain they're going to win.

Oh?

Hey, that's Koichi.

Why's he trying to act all cool, drinking tea?

Hey, Ko—

What?!

A... A girl?!

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

Episode 8  Yukako Yamagishi Falls in Love, Part 1

Koichi, was me asking
you to come here, um...

a bother?

Huh? No, it's not a bother...

But I was wondering what you needed.

Wow, so Koichi's with a girl...

That chick's in my class!
Her name is Yukako Yamagishi.

All right! Let's get a bit closer!

If you wanted to see my
notes on some homework,

my grades aren't that good,
and my handwriting's messy.

If it's money, I can probably
manage about 1,000 yen...

Or did you want me to switch
weekly duties with you?

That's not what this is about.

Huh? It's not? Then what is it?

If you need someone to take
in a kitten or a puppy,

we've already got a dumb
dog named Police at home.

Koichi!

I'm just going to come out and say it.

Koichi...

I'm in love with you, Koichi.

Huh?

What?!

U-Um... Uh, um... Wh-What?!

You're the only thing I think
about all day, Koichi.

I've been so afraid to
express these feelings...

But if I don't, I feel like
my chest is going to burst.

I don't mind if you hate me.

I just thought I'd be brave and tell you.

Wh-What is going on? Did someone
just confess her love to me?!

To me?!

I can't believe it, but she
did just say that, right?

I-I'm so happy...

Why is it Koichi? You can't
be serious! Come on!

Even I've never had anyone tell me that!

You don't have to cry about it.

But seriously? I'm surprised, Koichi...

I'm sure that you must have
a girlfriend, Koichi...

Huh? I-I don't...

But, um... Are you making fun of me?

I'm serious!

Koichi, your face has gotten sharper lately.

You look like a man with
courage and conviction.

But you're also so cute when you smile.

Yeah, she's definitely got a point.

My face is pretty sharp too, isn't it?

I think the best thing
about a man is his future.

And Koichi, your future is shining.

Wh-When you speak that highly of me...

I'm sure you must hate girls
like me that aren't cute.

Huh? Not cute? That's not true...

Damn it, she is cute!

Just say yes already!

That bastard has all the luck!

Do you hate me?

Huh? Uh, n-no, I don't, but...

Then do you love me?

Huh? Wait a sec... It's just that, um...

So you do hate me...

Huh? That's not it!

It's just, when you ask me that so suddenly—

Which is it?! Do you love me or don't you?!

Just answer me already!
I've already told you so much!

I spilled my coffee! This is all your fault!

Um... I just got all worked up...
I-I'm sorry. I'm just...

By the way, you will come
see me again, right?

Y-You know... I feel like a
balloon that's been deflated.

All my jealousy just flew away somewhere.

Y-Yeah...

Let's just pretend we never saw anything.

Yeah.

What's wrong with this cola?!

Th-Th-There's so much... hair in it!

Stand users are drawn to one another...

Nah, it couldn't be.

Chemistry Lab

It's me, Koichi.

Y-Yukako!

What are you doing?

Um, as you can see,
it's my turn to clean the lab.

Fourth period was chemistry lab.

Ah...

Koichi...

I said some weird things yesterday.

Would you just forget all that?

I get that way when I think too hard.
It's so embarrassing.

People are supposed to be more broad-minded.

Uh, r-right...

It was a little surprising,
b-but I didn't think anything of it...

Will you still be friends with me?

O-Of course! I would be honored, yes!

Thank goodness.

I was so worried about
what I'd do if you hated me,

I couldn't sleep all night.

That's a bit dramatic.

And to make it up to you... Here.

I was up until this morning
knitting this for you, Koichi.

Thank goodness! It's a perfect fit!

I knew your height and chest size, but
I was worried how it would fit your shoulders.

Charm

I made you a good luck charm, too...

In hopes that you'll find a wonderful love.

I also prepared lunch so we
could eat it together...

I bought this shrimp at the
fish market this morning.

You can't find this freshness at a store.

See this flounder meuniere?

I personally took out all of the
bones, one by one, with tweezers.

Here. Say, "Ah."

Ahh...

There's one thing I know now...

Yukako Yamagishi, to be completely
honest, is extremely strange!

Ahh...

I have to hurry up and turn her down!

B-But if I eat this, it'll be like saying yes...

Ahh!

But if I refuse it, she'll probably get mad.

What should I do?!

Hirose!

Why are you wasting time?

You need to hurry up and throw this
garbage away before class starts.

I-I'm saved!

R-Right! Right!

I-I'd better go throw it away.

Ugh, you're useless.

Here, give me that.

I'll hold half of it for you.

Huh? N-No, I'd feel bad...

Just give it to me!

I'm the class rep, so I'm
the one who'll get yelled at.

Jeez!

S-Sorry...

Hey, you.

Would you stop bothering Koichi?

Koichi? You mean Koichi Hirose?

I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

I know what you're doing.

The stench of a homewrecker is all over you.

Homewrecker?! What are you talking about?

Listen well. If you ever
come close to Koichi again,

I'll make sure you regret it.

Just one second.

I tried to be classy about this, but...

Koichi Hirose?

I couldn't care less about him!

You have no right to tell me what
the hell I can or can't do!

Dumbass!

Ow!

What was that?

What the hell is her problem?!

She's not right in the head.
She actually likes Hirose?

Hmph. Hilarious. I'll tell the whole school!

Huh?

What is that?

Something's hot... Something's wrong.

Something's not right...

It's insanely hot...

W-Water!

S-Someone! I need w-wa...

Hey, Josuke...

Looks like Yukako Yamagishi
really was a Stand user.

Her Stand has hair that moves.

Yeah. But it doesn't seem like she's
an enemy, or going to attack Koichi.

By the way, Okuyasu, what are
you gonna do about her hair?

I can't fix something after
your The Hand takes it away.

She can't complain. I saved her
from getting burnt to a crisp.

Sorry, but I'm not a beautician.

Year 1    English Exam    Answer Sheet
Quiz 2     Koichi Hirose

This is my English test from earlier.

I'm worrying so much about Yukako,
I can't concentrate on anything else.

Even I did better! I only got 32 points, though.

To be honest, I was a little happy at first.

I'd never had a girl tell me she loved me before.

I get that. I totally get that!
So much it hurts!

But I'm the one who let it come to this
by not being up-front with her.

I'm thinking about telling her straight

that I don't like her or anything,
so she needs to leave me alone.

That's not a good idea, Koichi.

If you say that, you're only going to add
fuel to the flames of Yukako's passion.

You'll piss her off.

Y-You think so?

Of course! Listen.

Convincing Yukako Yamagishi not to use
her Stand of hair for evil will have to wait.

Right now, we have to figure out
how to make her not hate you.

But how?

No matter how strongly she feels about you,

if she gets an idea in her head that you're
a disenchanting, horrible, boring guy,

everything will be happily ever after, right?

Y-Yeah...

So you've just got to act that
way on purpose in front of her.

Yeah, that totally makes sense!

You're so smart, Josuke.

Thanks!

But hearing that from you doesn't
make me feel better.

I wonder what I need to do to
make Yukako think I'm terrible.

Well, most girls aren't into
bad hygiene or mama's boys.

I-I don't want her to think I'm a mama's boy!

She might get mad at my
mom and put her in danger!

Then it's bad hygiene for you!

Starting today, no more baths.

Huh?!

Yeah, and don't brush your teeth
or change your underwear.

How about getting some lice
or spiders in your hair?

Having smelly socks is pretty bad.

Maybe you should fart everywhere.

Yeah, she'll totally hate that!

Stop messing around! I'm serious about this!

I'm being serious, too!

You need a snotty nose and some drool, too.

What?!

If you don't want to do that,
then you need to become a guy

who seems like he doesn't have a future.

You need to make her give up on you.

We'll help you out. All right?

Okay...

What? Koichi Hirose did that? Unbelievable!

He was really shoplifting? That's awful.

Yeah! Koichi said so himself.

He was talking about it like he was proud of it.

You know what else?
Koichi never keeps his promises.

I lent him money, and he never paid me back.

He cheats on his tests
and steals girls' underwear.

He's got no future. He's gonna
bring about his own downfall.

I'm gonna stop hanging out with him.

I'll cut ties with him, too.

Man, that girl is intense.

Now as long as Koichi confirms he
did all of this stuff by tomorrow,

she'll give up.

Josuke, Okuyasu...

I hope they did a good job with all that stuff.

I hope she actually gives up on me.

What is that?

My eyes are closed... Is this a dream?

A woman?

I-It's Yukako!

I can't believe this. She's even
showing up in my dreams...

I can't rest at all!

It appears that your friends don't
think too highly of you, Koichi.

But don't worry. You have me.

I'll properly discipline you and
make you into a fine man.

You have something that other men don't.

You must live up to that potential.

J-Josuke! This totally backfired!

Where am I?

Koichi, are you hungry?

Breakfast will be ready shortly.

O-Okay...

She has that hair Stand...

I'm going to have to wait for a chance to run.

That's my only hope!

Th-There's something I want to ask you.

Yes?

Your hair last night... Wh-What was that?

Did that startle you?

Of course. I guess anyone who
suddenly saw that would be.

Around February of this year,

someone shot an arrow through my chest.

No, that might have been a dream.

When I woke up, my wound was healed,
and I was able to do that...

Keicho Nijimura!

D-Do you know anyone else who
can do anything like that?

No.

She hasn't realized that I'm a Stand user!

Now, have a seat. You're a growing boy.

If you don't get proper nourishment,

you can't become a fine man for me.

I-I just need to play along with her for now.

Wow, this looks delicious! I'm digging in!

You're not eating just yet, Koichi.

English Exam    Answer Sheet
Koichi Hirose

You got a 16 on your English exam.

Even if a man is more than just
his brains, this is just awful.

I've decided to have you study while you eat.

Understand?

I'm going to give you some questions.

You'll choose the correct
answer from boxes A, B, and C,

and you'll eat what's inside your chosen box.

W-Wait a sec...

You're going to do this!

While you live in this house, everything
we do must be for your betterment!

Right?

Here's your question.

Prince often sings the lyric "funky music."
What does that mean in Japanese?

Wild Music

A: Wild music.

B: Primitive music.

Primitive Music

C: Fantasy music.

Fantasy Music

I-If I disobey, I'll be in trouble...

B-But I have no idea what the answer is.

I have a feeling it's A,
but B and C also sound right.

Whatever, I'll just pick one.

I think it's B...

Squee! You're right!

I'm so happy! This box contains boiled eggs!

I'll peel them for you.
You want some salt, right?

By the way, if you had chosen box A,
I would have had you eat this eraser.

Wild Music

Huh?!

Box C contained soap.

Wh-What?!

Next, you'll be able to eat
bacon and eggs. Do your best.

Question:  How is "contrast" (taisho)
written in Japanese?

Is it taisho A, taisho B, or taisho C?

Taisho

Taisho

Taisho

Sh-She's serious...

If I choose the wrong box, she'll definitely
make me eat what's in there...

Come on, hurry up and answer!

The food will get cold.

U-Um, uh...

What am I going to do? This is ridiculous...

I-I think it's C...

Koichi, you just chose your answer by
watching the look on my face, didn't you?

Huh?!

So the rumors about you being someone

who's sneaky and shoplifts and
cheats on his tests is true!

As punishment, I'll have
you eat both A and B.

A is English vocabulary corn flakes.

B is asparagus wrapped in pages
from an English dictionary.

I'm going to make sure
you learn while you eat!

Here!

Open your mouth! I'll feed it to you.

What's the matter? Eat!

No way! You expect me to put up
with this?! I can't take it anymore!

I'm outta here!

I-I'm being pulled! By my scalp!

Th-There's moving hair mixed in!

That's right. I had planted a few hundred
strands of my hair in your scalp.

Koichi,

you may come to hate me.

But once you leave this house,

you'll see a much better man in the mirror,

and I know you'll thank me.

You'll realize that you need
a woman like me in your life.

You won't be able to live
without Yukako Yamagishi.

And just so you know, until you
finish eating plates A and B,

you won't be getting the next dish.

This is some company president's holiday villa.

No one will come here until summer.

S-Summer?!

Even then,

it doesn't matter if anyone comes...

Because love is invincible.

H-Help me!

They were talking about

So he is missing. And since
Yukako isn't here, either...

I sort of feel responsible.

You don't think he's dead, do you?

Nah, I doubt she's gone that far yet.

She must be keeping him somewhere.

We need to find him, and fast.

This might end up being

Episode 9  Yukako Yamagishi Falls in Love, Part 2

I washed your underwear and
your pajama pants for you.

What's wrong?

I won't know if you don't say anything.

I-I'm a first-year in high school...

This is just the worst.

This goes beyond being embarrassed.
I feel like an awful human being.

Please, stop this already.

You hate me now, don't you?

You think I'm pathetic, don't you?

Just let me go home already.

What could you possibly like
about me, after I peed my pants?

Oh, you poor thing, Koichi.

I must be tormenting your heart.

I'm a bad girl.

Nothing I say does any good!

I-I can feel tears starting to well up...

First I wet my pants, and now
I'm getting wet with tears?

But Koichi...

After saying that you're
an awful human being,

I can see something shining, something
invigorating, deep in your eyes.

Like you still have a trump
card hidden up your sleeve.

That's what I like about you.

I would love to see what that is.

And if it belongs to someone you love,

there's nothing wrong with
even poop or snot, right?

It's strange that you'd even worry.

I felt true bliss while I was washing your pants.

Look!

I'm working on a chair that has
electricity running through it.

I'll make sure it's done by dinner study time.

I'm thinking about making Italian for dinner.

I should go buy some olive oil.

Look forward to it.

H-Help me!

She's just getting worse!

I have to hurry and escape,

o-or she's seriously going to kill me!

But...

How am I going to escape?

Koichi's got Reverb, though.

With that thing, he can still call for
help even if he's being gagged, right?

But Reverb's range is about 50 meters.

He might've been taken to a place
where no one else lives nearby.

There are tons of places like that.

Wait!

She said she was going
to buy some olive oil.

But I can't imagine her going out
shopping in this situation.

Is she going to order by phone, then?

Could it be...

There it is! A pay phone!

48 meters! Yes!

It's just within my range!

Reverb is a sound Stand!

Now I can signal Josuke for help.

I don't have any 10 yen coins!

I was wearing pajamas
when I was brought here.

Should I dial 110?

But that woman might
actually kill the police.

I'm just going to have to
contact Josuke somehow!

You were wondering if there was
a pay phone nearby, weren't you?

Y-Yukako...

I know exactly what you're thinking.

You heard me say that I was
going to get some olive oil,

so there must be a pay phone nearby.

But even if you were to get to it,
you don't have any 10 yen coins.

That's what you were thinking, right?

I-Is there a pay phone?

Hmph. Playing dumb, I see.

You should abandon the idea
of trying to call someone.

You wont be able to set
foot outside of this house.

Just in case, I'm going to go destroy
the 110 button on the phone.

Is there anything that you'd like?

N-No, not really...

Wh-What is wrong with her?!

I guess it's no use... I can't contact anyone...

As long as the call sounds go through,
calls on those phones will be connected.

Hello, is this Koichi?
Hey! It's me, Josuke!

Koichi, where are you?

What? I can hear the sound of waves...

Koichi, you...

You have a power like I do, don't you?

Yes! Now Josuke will definitely come here!

It'll only take 15 to 20 minutes by car.

I just have to survive until then!

N-No matter what!

The sound of waves... A pay phone...

The place Koichi is...

It's gotta be here!

Koichi.

Koichi!

She's coming back!

I-I've got no choice but to fight!

Open the door, Koichi.

Wh-Why don't you just break the door down?

If Josuke sees a broken door,
he'll definitely think something's wrong.

I'm very happy right now.

I'm so happy that you have
powers like I do, Koichi.

Though it pisses me off that
you were hiding that from me.

But I'm still very happy.

Because the most important thing for
a man and a woman living together

is love, and having the same
goals and values, right?

We have something in common
that no one else has.

We have the ultimate compatibility.

So please, Koichi...

Open the door.

I told you to open the door.
Hurry up and open the door!

I hate you

I hate you

I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

Th-The ultimate compatibility?!
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

Can't you tell how much
I don't want to be here?!

That sound won't go away until you cry,
apologize, and give up on me.

What is this? I don't hear any of this.

I hate you—

Huh?!

Th-This is...

nothing like that time with Tamami.

Her delusions are way too strong!

I had no idea sh-she'd be this stubborn...

I finally found out that we've
been bound by the one

and only red thread in this world.

Some people never find it at all.

Don't you understand how wonderful that is?

Koichi...

I was going to try to make you into a fine man,

but now things are different.

I won't let you leave this house
until you fall in love with me.

I will make you love me!

Or else...

I might just kill you.

I can't let her in here, no matter what...

I need to attack her with
Reverb one more time!

If I try harder, I'll be able to
produce a louder sound than before.

Reverb!

Something's wrong with Reverb...

Wh-What is that?

It's called a "Stand"?

What is that Stand?

This shoe cabinet is in my way!

I-I'm going to be killed!

If she comes in the door and catches me,
then sooner or later, I'll be killed!

Open up, Koichi!

Don't come through that door!

If only that door would blow her far away...

It's gone! It's just an empty shell.

Where did you put it?

Huh?

I'm asking what happened
to the thing inside that!

Huh?!

Th...

That's...

Wh-What is this? My Reverb

i-isn't dead!

Did it emerge from its old
shell into a new form?

What is this?

The design's only changed
a little, and it shrank.

Just changing its shape
won't make any difference!

I-It's fast!

Wh-What is

this wind?!

Bam

Sh-She got blown away!

I'm not sure how, but she just got
blown away by something like wind!

Wh-What just...

happened to me?

Reverb's letters are on the door...

Fwoosh

Fwoosh

Because she touched the door with
these words on it, they became real.

Fwoosh
The sensation of "Fwoosh"
actually blew her away.

Earlier, I wished this door would blow her away...

I guess I was unknowingly controlling it.

This is the new Reverb!

Reverb Act 2!

Koichi...

Teioh

It's those two...

If it's a place near the sea with
a lot of uninhabited houses,

it has to be this area with all the villas.

But there are, like, dozens of villas around here.

We can't tell which one it is.

We have to find the pay phone!
Koichi called us from one.

Let's find the pay phone first and
then look at the houses near it.

Yeah.

Cute little Koichi belongs to me.

I won't let anyone else have him.

You probably shouldn't come any closer, Yukako.

I can tell for myself

that you can't beat my Reverb Act 2's abilities.

You won't be able to keep me here.

My left eyelid is starting to twitch.

Ever since I was little,
my orbicularis oculi muscle would

start twitching when I got worked up,

and I'd start to feel a bit violent.

Don't you get up on your high horse just because

you've obtained a slightly different ability!

I'm going to have to get violent now!

Hot!

H-How dare you?!

My hand got burnt! You little shit!

When you said you were going to get violent,

did you mean how you're talking right now?

How dare you do this to me?!

You're just a baby chick!

You belong to me!

You belong to me, but you dare defy me?!

Even though you belong to me?!

Reverb Act 2!

I missed?

Hey, Josuke.

I heard it.

That was the sound of something breaking.

Hey, I think it's that house.

T-To think that her hair
would grow this much...

Her mental ability is too strong.

Mental ability that's completely
black and vindictive...

Was yours called Reverb?

Now that I know what it does,
it's not impressive at all.

I just need to make sure I don't
touch those letters, right?

By the way, I'll ask you one more time...

You love me, right?

Just try to say that you don't love me.

I'll rip you and this house
apart right here, right now.

If you die, you'll be mine forever,

because you'll live on in my
heart as a memory forever.

Hurry up and answer me!

I'm in this mess right now because

you wouldn't understand when I told you.

I've been telling you that I don't like you

all this time.

I'll kill you, Koichi!

Dogon

I've also already told you

that you won't be able to catch me.

You've touched the letters
that will blow you away.

Those letters are on me,
the one you called a little shit.

Her hair turned white!

She's not dead, is she?

She's alive!

Even though she's crazy and downright nasty,

I suppose I should be happy about this.

I wasn't able to catch you...

But I figured out that all I need
to do is destroy your Stand!

Impudent brat!

Dumbass!

I-I can't believe you can still attack...

Your mental ability is insane!

Shut up!

How dare you, you little pissy-pants?!

How dare you do this to me?!

My precious hair turned white,

you limp-dicked bastard!

I loved you!

But I can't forgive you for
doing this to my beautiful hair!

I don't care who you are! I won't
forgive you if you harm my beauty!

I'm gonna rip off this pissy-pants' little dick
and pull out his organs along with it!

S-Stop...

Shut up!

You're gonna end up like
that, too, aren't you?!

What? What was that noise just now?

Let go of my Reverb and grab hold of something.

The cliff is going to crumble.

When Reverb heard the sound of your heart,

it also heard the sound
of the ground cracking.

Hah! Don't make up shit just
because you think it'll save you!

I have to let go of this thing
and grab on to something!

Damn it!

I-I don't have... time!

Boingy-Boing

Boingy-Boing

It crumbled, just like I said, right?

But you don't understand
anything I say, do you?

You mean you had written it there already?

When I was trying to rip Reverb apart...

You put those letters on
that rock beneath the cliff?

You mean that while I was
trying to kill Koichi,

he was already trying to
think of how to save me?

I-I've lost completely.

No, I lost the moment I first saw Koichi.

Hey, Koichi! Are you alive?

Are you all right, Koichi?!

Josuke! Okuyasu!

Took you long enough to get here! Jeez!

B-But I love him even more now.

I don't care if he completely ignores me.

I'm happy just thinking

about you, Koichi!

Hey, look over there! Is that Yukako?

Her hair's gone completely white!

Whoa, you're right.

But isn't that chick smiling like
she couldn't be any happier?

And she's looking right this way.

Huh?!

You're right. That's creepy as hell.

Let's get outta here!

Save me, Josuke!

Don't depend on me!

Well, I'll be damned.
Did you see that, Masaji?

There's a new Italian restaurant.
Apparently it's just ahead.

Just ahead is the cemetery.

No one would come to eat at a
restaurant in a place like this.

Josuke, I think that might actually
be what brings people in.

The flavor must be like,
"Oh, man! I can't stop drooling!"

Let's go! Let's go!

Two of you?

Come, have a seat.

Uh... Thanks...

Please.

R-Right...

Um, are you a foreigner?

Si, Signore. I'm Italian.

My name is Tonio Trendy.
Please call me Tonio.

Well, this is great! We get
to eat authentic Italian food!

I have traveled the world.

I've studied various cuisines to
better the cuisine of my motherland.

Then I came to Japan hoping to get my chance.

Morioh is a wonderful place.

There are plenty of farms where
you can get fresh produce,

and the seafood is wonderful, as well.

I love it very much.

Using the ingredients
that Morioh has to offer,

I will bring you food that
will make you feel your best.

Nice! I wonder what I should get.

Could we hurry up and get the menu?

Menu?

We don't have a menu here.

What do you mean you don't have a menu?

Because what I serve depends on the customer.

So show me the menu.

No, no! It means that I will determine
the dishes by looking at the customers.

What the hell?

You mean you're not going to let the
customer eat what they want? Huh?

You had diarrhea last night, didn't you?

Your intestinal walls are inflamed.

And you didn't sleep enough. You only
slept about four hours, didn't you?

No wonder your eyes are so puffy.

Let me see your left hand, too.

Yes, yes... You have athlete's
foot on your right foot.

You have two cavities and your
left shoulder is stiff, right?

H-How do you know all that?!

That's all correct!

By looking at both of your hands,
I know everything about your health.

Oh, I'm sorry!

What about you, signore?

Yeah, I'm not really hungry,
so just coffee is fine.

I'll have a cappuccino.

Ho capito.

Healthy food that concentrates
too much on being healthy

usually doesn't taste good.

If it tastes even a little bad,
we don't have to pay.

We can complain and leave.

Right.

J-Josuke...

This water... No, is this mineral water?

What's up?

I-I've never had water this delicious before!

It's like... water filled with elegance...

It's like the water a princess in the Alps
playing a harp would drink, perhaps.

It's so soothing.

Like the first water you drink after
wandering in the desert for three days.

Y-You're right! This is great!

So good!

Whew

You're right. This is delicious.

What brand of water is this?

Th-This water is so delicious
that I'm about to cry.

Hey, you don't have to cry just
from drinking some water.

Maybe it's because it's so pure.

Do you have a handkerchief?
The tears won't stop.

The tears just keep flowing! It won't stop!

O-Okuyasu! Hey, there's
something wrong with you.

Are you okay?

Gush

O-Okuyasu!

Gush

Wh-What the hell's with these tears?!

They just keep flowing!

Okuyasu, y-your eyes, your
eyeballs, the white part...

It's all shriveled up and squishy!

Momento! Please do not panic.

Y-You bastard! What did
you make Okuyasu drink?

Please, calm down! His eyeballs will
only be shriveled up momentarily.

That mineral water is from
snow on Kilimanjaro in Africa

that melted 50,000 years ago.

It's water that flushes out
the inside of the eyeball,

along with any dirt,
and helps relieve insomnia.

The reason you didn't start
crying when you drank it

is because you got plenty of sleep last night.

Josuke!

I'm not sleepy at all now!

I feel refreshed! Like I slept a full ten hours!

Seriously? O-Okuyasu, are you sure
there's nothing wrong with your eyes?

Josuke, when you drink water
this good for the first time,

trust me, you're bound to cry.

I cried even more when I watched
the movie Champ on video.

Really?

Yeah!

Here's your cappuccino.

R-Right...

Now, shall we continue with the meal?

Hey, that looks really good.

Ingredients
• Mozzarella cheese (4 thin slices)
• Tomatoes (5 thin slices)
Tonio's Special Dressing
• 1 Anchovy • Seaweed • Olive oil
• White wine vinegar • Lemon juice • Salt • Pepper • Etc.
• Balsamic vinegar (just a splash) • Toast • Lettuce (for garnish)
(Best eaten within 15 minutes of preparation)

For the antipasto, we have a salad
with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes.

M-M-Mozzaza?

Mozzarella cheese is a soft, fresh cheese
whose fat has been taken out.

Everyone in Italy loves to eat it.

The first people to use tomatoes
in cooking were the Italians.

Nothing can compare to the way
an Italian prepares tomatoes.

This is not bragging. It's merely pride.

Please, help yourselves.

Heck, yeah!

Yeah, that's pretty good.

It's good. Pretty good.

But... I'm not sure what it is, but this
cheese doesn't have much flavor.

No! No!

You need to put it in your
mouth with the tomato.

What? With the tomato?

Well, most foreign dishes don't
suit Japanese tastes.

So good!

Huh?!

The juicy part of the tomatoes
wraps around the mild cheese!

The cheese brings out the tomato,
and the tomato brings out the cheese!

It's like harmony, or like a harmony of tastes!

It's kind of like a Simon and Garfunkel duet!

Ucchan with Nanchan!

The Ashita no Joe that
Tetsuya Chiba drew

with Asao Takamori's original story.

Grazie! I couldn't be
happier that you enjoyed it.

H-Hey, Okuyasu. Let me try a little.

No way.

You should just order some yourself!

There's no way you're getting mine.

I wouldn't give you any even if
you were about to die of hunger.

It's so good! I'm so glad I was born, Mom!

Damn it! I knew you were cheap,
but I didn't know it was this bad!

Fine. I'll order a plate myself.

Ho capito.

However, the only one who will have
his stiff shoulder cured is the

customer right there,
who has the stiff shoulder.

Huh? Stiff shoulder?

C-Come to think of it, my neck feels a bit hot.

It's oddly sweaty.

Sir, I recommend that you take off your jacket.

S-Suddenly...

I-I-I'm getting really itchy!

S-Something slimy is stuck to my fingers!

That would be dead skin.

Dead skin?!

It's proof that your metabolism has
improved and blood is circulating well.

The calcium, vitamins, and minerals
in the antipasto that you just ate

have stimulated the thyroid gland in
your throat that controls your metabolism.

All of your bad cells are
coming out as dead skin.

Keep scratching, and get
all of the dead skin off!

Okuyasu, stop scratching!
It's as big as a softball now!

You're starting to dig at
the muscle in your shoulder!

N-No! You're wrong, Josuke!

It's light!

My shoulder feels so stupidly light!

I feel like there's a balloon on
my shoulder now, it's so light!

Look! My shoulder's so much more flexible!

I've never been able to do this before!

My shoulder isn't stiff anymore!

Now, if you'll excuse me for a bit.

I have to make sure the pasta boils properly.

Holy crap! That Chef Tonio guy is a genius!

N-No...

Something's definitely wrong here!

There's definitely something
strange about his cooking!

Morioh Landmark 3
"Italian Restaurant Trendy"
How to get there: 1 minute on foot
after getting off the bus headed
towardMorioh's Kunimi Mountain
Pass Cemetery
An unusual restaurant with no
set menu. The chef will decide
the menu based on how the
customer is feeling that day.
Because seating is limited, it is
recommended that you
make a reservation.

Now, let's continue with the meal, shall we?

Next is the primo piatto.

This will be your pasta course.

I call it... harlot spaghetti!

Ingredients
• Spaghetti • Pitted black olives
• Olive oil • Anchovies
• Garlic • Red peppers
• Cherry tomatoes
•Misc: Parsley, salt, pepper, etc
•Parmesan cheese
(Best eaten while still hot)

Apparently the name of this dish came from

hard-working ladies of the night
making something random

that happened to be good.

Usually, you don't put cheese
on pasta with garlic,

but this pasta is an exception.

Are there red peppers in this spaghetti?

Yes, there are.

Rome
Naples
The harlot's spaghetti uses a pasta sauce
that is one of the oldest in Italian cuisine.

Spaghetti

Tagliatelle

Linguine

Fusilli

Penne

Farfalle

It was born in my hometown of Naples.

Lasagna

Conchiglie

Tubetti

That is why I recommend this dish.

Oh, well... I can't eat spicy things.

I can't even eat curry rice unless it's

Vermont Curry's mild flavor
with the apples and honey.

I can't eat sushi with wasabi in it, either.

I can't! It's super spicy!

This is way too spicy!

If you can't eat spicy food, Okuyasu,

then don't eat it.

If you can't eat it, don't worry.

I'm perfectly fine with not
charging for that pasta.

I will go make the secondo
piatto, the main dish.

However, my spaghetti is made
such that even people who

do not like spicy things can eat it.

Even if I don't like spicy things?

Hot!

I totally admit that you're
a talented chef, Tonio!

That guy's definitely a genius!

But this was a miss.

No, maybe you were lucky
that you couldn't eat it.

Don't you think this food and
that water are way too weird?

It's too suspicious!

Suspicious? What is?

So hot!

You lost a softball's worth of dead skin,
and you cried your eyes out!

You think so?

When I went to Shirabu
Hot Springs in Yamagata,

I lost even more dead skin,
and my back pain went away!

That much is totally normal.

Hot!

Listen! I just remembered what
that Toshikazu Hazamada said.

Stand users, for some reason,
seem to be unknowingly...

Stand users are drawn to each other!

Josuke!

Are you saying that Tonio
is a Stand user, too?

Shh! We don't know yet!
That's why I'm saying he's suspicious!

Suspicious, eh?

Hot! I can't eat this!

If you can't eat spicy food, stop licking it!

Th-That's right. I can't eat
spicy food, but you know...

I just want to keep licking
this spaghetti sauce.

Why are you eating it?!

I-I know! I shouldn't be able
to eat something this spicy...

But...

I can't help myself. Once I tasted it,
I was sucked in by the spiciness.

It's like when you eat your age
in beans at the Setsubun Festival,

and you don't even really like them,
but before you know it,

you've eaten a whole bag!

Hey, I told you to stop eating that!

M-My stomach's opening up!

The more I eat, the more I want to eat!

It's so good!

Okuyasu, you idiot!

Your tooth! Your tooth just flew out!

That's my cavity! My rotten tooth fell out!

C-Come to think of it, I had a
cavity on my lower jaw, too...

That's a cavity, too!

Your tooth! A molar is
growing in at that speed?!

This settles it. I don't know
what he's plotting, but...

Shining Diamond!

But I wanted to eat more...

I'm going to revert that spaghetti
back to its original ingredients!

What were those little things just now?

A Stand!

Tonio Trendy was a Stand user after all!

Are you all right, Okuyasu?

My sleepiness is gone.

My shoulder stiffness disappeared, and
new teeth replaced my cavities, but...

M-My stomach hurts!
My stomach's hurting so bad!

Wait there!

Tonio! Just what are you plotting?!

Where is he?

So the main course is finished...

Good, good... You're eating that right up.

Looks like the main dish,
lamb in apple sauce, is a success.

What?!

What are you doing there?

You saw, didn't you?!

So you came in here to spy on me?!

You will pay for this! Prepare yourself!

Why do I have to listen to you
threatening to make me pay?

That's my line!

What the hell are you trying
to do with your cooking?!

Okuyasu!

Why are you eating?!

I can't help it! My stomach hurts,
but I can't help eating it!

Every time the tanginess of the apple sauce

and the juice from the lamb goes
down my throat, I feel happiness!

To think a flavor like this
existed in this world!

Don't eat that meat, Okuyasu!

I'm so happy! It's like happiness over and over!

It's so good!

M-My innards...

My stomach!

Okuyasu!

You'll pay for this!

You bastard!

Wash your hands with soap right now!

Medicinal

Medicinal

Huh?!

It's unforgivable!

Entering the kitchen without
permission is unforgivable!

You! The kitchen must stay clean!

S-Soap? Are you telling me to wash my hands?

Hey, Josuke!

My guts suddenly feel way better!
I feel really full, too.

I feel totally satisfied.

Huh?!

My diarrhea tummy's all better!

What?!

Good for you.

Nothing brings me more joy and
happiness than a customer who

enjoys my cooking and becomes healthy.

The puppy...

This dish was a little iffy,
so I was having him taste it first.

His tummy was a little upset, too.

Y-You... seriously only wanted
to feed Okuyasu good food?

What else could a chef ask for?

That is what I live for. That is all I hope for.

You're a Stand user, aren't you?

We are, too.

Oh, I cannot believe it!

When... When I went around the world

looking for what my ideal cooking would be,
that's when I realized my powers.

This is the first time I've met
anyone else with similar powers.

But you! You lack common sense!

Huh?

You touched things without
washing your hands, didn't you?!

The number one enemy in a kitchen is germs!

That's why I got angry!

H-Huh? I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean it!

You'd better prepare yourself!

Now, let us continue with the cooking.

Dessert is... flan?

But I'm a street punk!

Hmph! Me eating flan is laughable.

So good!

You really are a genius!

I'm so proud to live in Morioh,
where a chef like you lives!

Damn you, Okuyasu!

It appears that he's pleased.

You! Your hands aren't moving!

This is so pathetic...

Hey, my athlete's foot is all better!

Please come again. Grazie!

Episode 11
Chili Pepper, Part 1Josuke, how long are you
going to be playing that?

If you don't turn off that video game now,

I'm gonna shut it off myself.

Just five more minutes! Please!

Just let me play for five more minutes!

This is the most exciting part!

If I stop right now,

I'll be a man who couldn't accomplish
the one thing he set out to do,

Come on! If you don't quit,

and I'll regret it the rest of my life!

Do you really want your son
to end up like that, Mom?!
the kicks are just going to get harder!

How long can you put up with this?

I-It's over...

D'oh.

Now, put that away and do your homework.

And take off your damn
uniform when you're at home.

It's nighttime!

I won't be able to see you anymore.

Why, Sachiko? Don't you love me?

Weird. I thought I turned it off.

That's not it. I'm thinking about leaving town.

And you want to forget about me?

Huh? It won't turn off.

Looks like Jotaro Kujo's not leaving town...

Even though I warned him all those times.

Well, what's the deal, Josuke Higashikata?

You're...

Chili Pepper?!

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

Diamond is Unbreakable

Episode 11  Chili Pepper, Part 1

Why'd you come here?

Don't ask that now.

I've been stopping by here every
now and then for a while now.

What?

So this bastard's been
watching me for a long time?

I've been frequently going to visit Okuyasu,

the younger brother of Keicho,
whom I got rid of,

and I'm very familiar with Koichi Hirose's
Reverb and Yukako Yamagishi, as well.

And I know that Toshikazu Hazamada

and Tamami Kobayashi are
both in the hospital.

What I'm asking you is what are you
actually doing in front of me,

when all this time you've been
sneaking around like a gutless coward?

I doubt this is it,

but you're not dumb enough to actually
think you're going to kick my ass, are you?

Kick your ass?

I'd never do anything that awful to you.

I'm here to kill you painlessly.

I just can't laugh at your
sad excuse for a joke,

good sir.

I told Jotaro this before, but Jotaro's
Star Platinum is a menace to me.

It's the fact that Jotaro is too attentive

and the fact that Star Platinum
has the power to stop time.

So I just wanted to see just how much
stronger my Stand has gotten over time.

Before I fight Jotaro,

I thought I'd test myself
against you, Josuke Higashikata.

Come a bit closer.

Closer! Until you can attack as quickly
and precisely as Star Platinum, Josuke!

Come on! If you're that far away,
your punches will be too weak.

Are you mocking me?

Of course not.

I've just seen through your abilities.

Come closer and give me a super sharp one.

Here. Hit me right here.
Come on. Come closer!

Crack!

Huh? H-He's fast...

Quit your daydreaming!

Much faster than I thought!

If you want to keep daydreaming,

maybe I'll just help you sleep!

Listen up! Jotaro's Star
Platinum is nothing like this!

I regret my actions.

I got a little cocky and underestimated him.

What?!

Josuke! What the hell is all that noise?

What was that Stand power?
It felt like a jet engine going off...

He might just be stronger than Jotaro...

You, too, Josuke.

Your Shining Diamond surprised me.

Looks like I'm not the only one that's grown.

I'll wait a little longer.

Until my Chili Pepper grows stronger,
I won't be able to defeat Jotaro.

He can show up anywhere there's electricity.

Not only does he have tremendous power,
but he can control his Stand remotely.

Josuke, I just asked you
what all that noise was!

It's nothing.

Man, a bug totally just bit me.

Damn it! Bugs only come to me.

Ah, Josuke!

Sorry to keep you guys waiting.

What did you want to talk about, Josuke?

Why call us out to a
lonely-looking place like this?

Couldn't we go to Tonio's or the usual café?

I'm not the one who called you
guys out here. It was Jotaro.

Jotaro did? I wonder what he wants.

It's probably about Chili Pepper.

What?! Chili Pepper?

You mean the Stand, Chili Pepper?!

So he appeared?

Yeah, he did. At my place last night.

You bastard! Why didn't you
let me know right away?!

Okuyasu... He acts completely different
when it comes to Chili Pepper.

I can't blame him, since that
Stand killed his brother, but...

I told Josuke to keep quiet.

Talking about him in the city, where
there's electricity running, is dangerous.

Jotaro!

I had you all come to this field
so he wouldn't hear us talking.

Okuyasu, Chili Pepper
totally pisses me off, too.

He got into my house without me knowing.

He's free to listen to us talking
and take whatever he wants.

Come to think of it, the homework I finished

the other day disappeared from my desk!

And I thought my mom mistook it for trash—

That's not a big deal, Koichi!

What I'm trying to say is that the only reason

Chili Pepper hasn't caused more
trouble is that we're around,

and he drags people who piss
him off into the phone lines

with about as much effort as
someone making a pervy phone call.

Of course, he can use the bow and arrow,

and he may have already used it on someone.

I saw first-hand that he's gotten stronger.

We have to hurry up and
find out who his user is.

B-But how?

We all gathered here to figure
that out, right, Jotaro?

No, not quite.

We'll be able to find him.

Because the person who's capable

of finding him is arriving
at Morioh Port at noon.

Huh?

Someone who can find him?

Is he a Stand user?!

That's right.

His Stand's name is Hermit Purple.

Only he's gotten way too old, so he
doesn't have the strength to fight.

Too old? How old is this guy?

Do you know him, Jotaro?

Yeah. I know him very well.

He used to be pretty ripped,

though you wouldn't guess that now.

He's 80... No, maybe he's 79...

79?! He's super old!

Well, his legs are weak,
so he's using a cane.

He had surgery to remove
gallstones two years ago,

and suffers from cataracts.

He wears full dentures

and complains that he can't eat T-bone steaks.

He's also starting to forget things.

Hey, come on, now.

You're not gonna tell me his hobby
is talking to mailboxes, are you?

Give me a break!

I had you guys gather here in
order to protect that old man.

If Chili Pepper finds out about him,
he's probably going to kill him.

Because the thing Chili Pepper fears
most is us finding out who his user is.

Yeah, but is a geezer like that
really going to be useful to us?

I tried to stop him,

but when he heard about the bow and
arrow, he came to Japan on his own.

Came to Japan? Is he a foreigner, Jotaro?

Yeah.

Josuke, th-this is serious!

Huh? What is?

Josuke! If he's 79, a foreigner,
and a Stand user...

Y-You can't mean...

I heard you loud and clear.

Chili Pepper!

Impossible! How'd he get to this field?

Morioh Landmark #4
Morioh Grand Hotel
How to get there: From bus stop #1,
take the bus for "Morioh Grand
Swimming Area" and get off at the
"Morioh Grand Hotel" stop.
From there, it's a 0-minute walk.
Located in the same area as many
expensive villas, it's an elegant hotel
full of history. It has housed various
travelers to Morioh and has been
beloved for years. The beef tongue
served at the hotel restaurant is
considered superb and is
the talk of the town.

Rumble

Why?! There aren't any
electrical lines here, so how?!

The bike's battery.

Shit! He must have hidden in the
bike's battery and followed us here.

In my bike?

He heard us!

The port at noon?

An old geezer Stand user who can find me?

Rumble

I'll be sure to kill that geezer the
moment he arrives at the port!

Now he knows about the old man...

In other words, Josuke's father.

Rumble

This isn't good.

If we let him go, he's gonna get
to the old man before we do.

Josuke! We need to throw a rock
at that bike and destroy it!

No, hold up.

For the sake of revenge, I, Okuyasu Nijimura,

will kill that bastard!

He cut through space-time!

Ack! Keicho's younger brother!

I'm the one who's going to deal with you.

I'll scrape you away!

Okuyasu, I compliment you,

at least in regards to you
instantly transferring over here.

But the scratching motion
you do with your The Hand

seems to stand no chance
against Chili Pepper's swiftness.

You're too slow!

Take a better look, you dumbass.

When I said I'll scrape you away,

I meant the bike.

The bike's front wheel!

Now you won't be able to run away.

You actually used your head,
Okuyasu. Good job!

Chili Pepper can't go far
from the bike's battery.

Which means... Look!

The nearest electrical line is
at least a hundred meters away,

so you're as good as caught!

That was close!

No, we haven't actually caught him yet.

The bike battery is still there.

I'm sure he plans to do whatever
he can to kill Okuyasu and run.

We're going, too!

Right!
Right!

Do you really think you've trapped me?

Are you trying to get revenge for Keicho?

No.

My Big Bro

deserved to die.

I knew that someone would kill him someday.

The thing about crimes...

When you keep doing stuff like that,

somewhere, somehow, it's going
to come back and get you.

Even I can figure that out.

If you tell me

your user's name and address,

I'll spare your life.

If I tell you, you'll spare my life?

You're calmer than I thought.

I thought your insides were boiling
from wanting revenge so badly.

Deep down inside, I hope you don't tell me!

I'm dying to scrape you away
so bad, you dumbass!

I knew it.

But you want to scrape me away?

With that pathetically slow right hand?

Should I laugh, or should I yawn?

It's a tough choice!

You bastard!

I'll kill you!

I'll make sure you know well

just how slow your Stand is!

Do you see now? It's this slow!

Okuyasu!

Okuyasu!

Shit!

Here comes Jotaro...

I can't stick around here for long.

What?! He's behind me?!

I may have missed, but I still
scraped through space-time,

so I could instantly transfer.

Did you forget?

I've got you now!

You little shit!

Looks like you're getting quite a bit slower.

Are you going to be able
to escape the next attack?

Look! Chili Pepper's electrical
sparkle is fading!

He's getting weaker!

His Stand's power must be running out!

Does this mean Okuyasu wins?

Okuyasu! Don't finish him off yet!

Wait until we get there.

You've won!

We have to ask him where the
bow and arrow are right now.

You're right... I'm weakening.

Your Stand's right hand is slow as hell,
but it's still a terrifying Stand.

But...

Are you sure you don't want to finish me off?

Maybe I'm just acting like
I've grown weak, Okuyasu.

What?!

Maybe I'm waiting for Jotaro to get
closer so I can chop his head off.

What the hell are you talking about?

Oh, nothing.

What will you do? Finish me off now,

or wait for Jotaro to get here?

You bastard...

But wait. Why would you tell me that?

If he hadn't told me he was acting weaker,

he could have tricked me, and beaten
me and Josuke by playing dirty...

Which means, uh, since he told me he's fine,

my chance of getting attacked is zero, right?

You're telling me to finish you off?!
Do you want to die?

I'll leave that up to you.

Is he really weaker?

Or is he lying about being weaker,
and he's actually fine?

Which is the truth?

Are you coming or aren't you?

If he's fine, I need to go in to finish him.

It's possible he's got
something up his sleeve, too.

Should I?

Okuyasu... Something's wrong.

Hurry up and make up your mind, Okuyasu.

Damn it!

I can't be bothered to think about
which is right anymore, damn it!

Okuyasu!

Don't try and stop me, Jotaro!

He killed my big bro!
I'm going to finish this!

That's the only truth inside my heart!

Die, you little shit!

Gaon

Just great. Now finding the bow
and arrow is going to be a real pain.

Though it looks like things were settled.

No, something is wrong.

It looks like Chili Pepper
really was plotting something.

Huh?!

There were electrical cables underground?

That bastard! He wanted me to dig this up!

I really was weakened.

The bike's battery is only a 12-volt.

That was close!

Why, you...

Thanks to you, I feel alive again!

Okuyasu!

If you had only been a good little boy

and held back like Jotaro told you,

the battery would have died,
and I would've been eliminated.

Wha...

I know where all of the
electrical lines in this city are.

I thought about running
away using those cables,

but they were far from the bike.

I didn't have the power to dig up the cables.

You bastard!

He's even more...

Which means the electricity from
earlier, the electrical power,

is on my side.

Bogo

Okuyasu!

Your big brother Keicho
said you held him back.

He was right.

Your mind is underdeveloped.

You never could have gotten
revenge, you dumbass!

Bye-bye, Jotaro, Josuke!

Joseph Joestar, was it?

I'll have that geezer share the
same fate as the Nijimura Brothers!

I've won!

Okuyasu!

He got dragged in there!

Okuyasu!

Okuyasu!

Good grief.

I can't believe we had him
cornered and he still got away.

He's a pretty dangerous Stand.

He can be controlled remotely,
and in terms of power,

What?! What are you guys talking about?!

he can take advantage of all the electrical
companies, making his power infinite.

Why are you analyzing the enemy's
abilities when Okuyasu just died?!

Oh, right. I guess we should
worry about Okuyasu.

Right.

Talk about a silver lining.

Looks like Okuyasu has really good luck.

Okuyasu was really lucky that
his right arm was chopped off.

Huh?

Shining Diamond!

When I fix his arm, it means
his body will come back.

Damn it!

Yay! Okuyasu is back!

Damn it... I-I...

I totally lost to that bastard.

Damn it! Damn it!

It's not about revenge or winning or losing.

We have to think about
protecting Joseph Joestar.

That'll lead to us defeating Chili Pepper.

You have to do that for everyone.

For the place where we live...

Jotaro, this isn't good.

I was taking this lightly.

Yeah. We have to get to the old
man's boat before Chili Pepper does.

Let's hurry to the port.

Hey, you two! Aren't you
acting a bit too cool?

Okuyasu's in shock!

If we're going to the port, this way is closer.

All right.

Hey, wait!

Surpass my big bro, huh...

You taught me a lesson, Chili Pepper.

Mr. Joestar.

We'll be arriving at Morioh
Port any moment now.

Episode 11
Chili Pepper, Part 2

Episode 11
Chili Pepper, Part 2There it is... The old man's ship.

Right on time.

It's about twenty minutes away.

I-Is Mr. Joseph Joestar the only passenger?

Yeah.

The entire crew is from
the Speedwagon Foundation.

The Stand Chili Pepper can only
move where there's electricity,

but I'm sure he'll do everything possible to get

over the water and onto the old man's ship.

If he gets there before we do, we lose.

The old man will be killed.

Jotaro!

We've finished checking the boat.

He's not in the battery.

All clear. We can take off.

Josuke, the only ones going to the
old man's boat are me and Okuyasu.

Huh?

You and Koichi will stay behind at the harbor.

Stay behind?! Josuke and me?

Why?

Josuke, Chili Pepper's user is hiding
somewhere in this harbor, watching us.

He's waiting for us to make our move,

so he can confirm the boat's position.

But my guess is that he won't be using a boat.

All he needs is something with a battery
that's faster than a motorboat.

Morioh Harbor
Lighthouse

Just like he did with the bike,

he'll have Chili Pepper fly over
in something that has a battery.

Fly? You mean it's actually
going to fly through the air?

Yeah.

I'm guessing Chili Pepper is

stealing a remote control model plane
from the model shop right now.

A remote control model plane?!

That could work!

Even model planes can travel over 100 kph!

That's faster than this motorboat.

And because Chili Pepper is controlling it,

he can keep going as long as
the battery and fuel last!

The controller signal's range won't matter!

So Josuke, if you spot something flying,
look for his user here at this harbor.

Koichi's Reverb has a range of 50 meters.

He can help find him.

If he makes his move before we do,
the old man is finished.

You need to protect your father
from on-shore. Got it, Josuke?

Yeah, I get it. We don't have
even a second to spare.

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

Diamond is Unbreakable

Episode 12  Chili Pepper, Part 2

Do your best, Okuyasu.

Thanks, Koichi.

We'll arrive at Morioh Port in about
twenty minutes, Mr. Joestar.

I see. Um...

Do you know where my cane is?

Huh? It's right in front of you.

Ahh...

My father, huh...

Josuke? Is something the matter?

Being told that some guy I've never
met is my father is just kinda...

You know...

Well, it's different if his life's in danger.

I won't be able to sleep well unless
I do my best to protect him.

Besides, I'm sure my mom
will bawl her eyes out if he dies.

Damn it! It must have been Jotaro.

If he had you two stay behind to find my user...

Then he completely saw through my
plan to use a remote control plane!

Chili Pepper!

Yeah!

Jotaro Kujo is a smart man.

Yeah, he's the one person
I don't want finding me.

This Spitfire remote control plane

can get to Joseph Joestar
in a mere five minutes.

On the other hand, a motorboat will
take about eight to ten minutes.

Which means if I take care of
you two in about three minutes,

I'll have plenty of time to get past them.

Y-You're Chili Pepper's user?

The name's Akira Otoishi, nineteen years old.

Oh, and don't mind the guitar.

My dream is to one day
be an ultra super guitarist,

like Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck,
who lives hard and passionately!

So I keep it with me all the time.

In the near future,
I'm going to take my guitar

and knock out people around the world!

Oh, yeah.

I never even thought that the user
would show himself on his own.

That must mean he's confident that
he can kill both me and Josuke!

Yeeees

I'll only use my pinky finger
against your Shining Diamond,

just like I did with Okuyasu earlier.

Stay back, Koichi.

Here we go, Josuke Higashikata!

One sec.

Huh?

If you're going to use only your pinky,

then I'm gonna make some rules, too.

Rules? Don't get cocky!

Someone like you doesn't need any rules!

How dare you do that, you bastard?!

Well, you said I didn't need any rules.

Didn't you say something about taking
care of me with just your pinky?

So what are you going to do,

Otoishi, my senpai?

I'm going to kill you.

You already said that earlier!

Stop saying the same thing
over and over, you dumbass!

This agony and pain...

What am I supposed to take it out on?

This rage...

Who do I proclaim it to?!

He's amazing...

Right-Hand Tapping

I'm going to kill

your mommas, too!

I was able to fully express my heart!

I was able to express the ultimate rage.

Just try it, Otoishi!

Wh-What? The user just...

I can understand his Stand
moving at amazing speeds,

but the user himself was actually
able to move behind me?

Th-That's not it, Josuke!

I saw what happened from here.

It wasn't Otoishi that moved...

It was you!

You were moved!

What?

Chili Pepper came out and
turned Shining Diamond

180 degrees at incredible speed!

You're facing the ocean, aren't you?

Chili Pepper came out?

Koichi! I haven't seen Chili Pepper at all!

He's underneath the ground!

See all the drainage grates around you?

His upper body came up from there just now!

There must be electrical wires
running all over under there!

I'm strong when I reflect on my actions.

Behind you to your right! There it is!

Now it's behind you!

It keeps running back into
the electrical wires!

And at light speed!

Jotaro's the only one who
can keep up, after all!

You don't have time to dig up the asphalt

and cut all the wires underground,
Josuke Higashikata.

And the more big holes
you make in the ground...

The more places I can pop up from!

Josuke! To your right!

In front of you!

Behind you!

No, wait! Um...

It's like insanely hard whack-a-mole!

He's moving too fast for me
to tell where he'll come from!

You should really stop relying on guesswork!

Josuke...

And I still have two minutes left...

That's plenty of time to finish you.

Koichi, watch where Chili Pepper
comes from and tell me.

I can't tell because I'm too close!

I-I can't tell, either!

Every time I think he's out, he goes back in!

Watch carefully, Koichi.

You should be able to tell
what I'm thinking by now.

Huh? What you're thinking?

I-It's all squishy!

The asphalt's been turned into coal tar...

And the grates are covered by
the oil film from the coal tar!

I got it!

When he hit the ground earlier,

he turned the asphalt's base into
something else when he fixed it!

Which means...

Behind you, to your left!

Gurb

Yeah! Bull's eye!

Bull's eye? That's great.

Do I get a prize

if I keep hitting him?

Chi

It's the boat! I can see the Traffic!

W-We're almost there!

Don't let your guard down yet.

Huh?

Wh-What the hell is that?

Josuke! Koichi!

I-It's so bright!

It seems that I wasn't taking you
seriously enough, Josuke Higashikata.

I have to give up these foolish thoughts,

don't you think?

I'm concentrating all of Morioh's
electricity on my Chili Pepper.

The reason I didn't do so before

is because the electricity of this whole
area, which is my power source,

would be drained to zero for a while!

But I don't care anymore!

After I defeat you two, I just need to
fly over there using the RC plane's battery

and kill Joseph!

I-I can't see!

You bastard...

J-Josuke actually got overpowered!

Josuke!

Do you see?

All of this town's electricity is on my side!

I'll be sure to tack the
cost of all the electricity

I just used onto your meter.

This is the end, Josuke!

A t-tire?!

By the time you realize it,
it's probably too late.

You blew up that tire on purpose, didn't you?

So you could fix it and trap my
Stand inside the tire's rubber!

That's right! Tire rubber is an insulator,
so it doesn't conduct electricity!

Chili Pepper won't be
able to use electricity!

Damn it!

Yes! Now we just have to wait for Jotaro...

Just kidding.

Huh?

You were going to insulate
me with tire rubber?

It might have worked if it
were about a meter thick!

Don't make me laugh!

As if this flimsy rubber
could have done anything!

You dumbass!

Bomu

You've lost, Josuke!

Great. You would have been much better off

if you didn't have the power
to break through that tire.

Th-The air from inside the tire!

It was completely full?!

N-Not the ocean! The ocean is very bad!

O-Oh, yeah...

Salt water conducts electricity.

Since the ocean's so vast, the electricity
will spread out in every direction!

I'm sorry! Please!

Pull me out of here!

You said something about reflecting
on your foolish thoughts,

but it seems that it's your
entire character that's foolish.

I-I'm dispersing...

His Stand's been split up! Which means...

H-He's dead?

Jotaro!

We defeated the user!

We defeated Chili Pepper's user!

Well done. That's a relief.

So this guy is Josuke's dad...

His body's huge, but he's
a rickety-looking geezer.

You there,

what's your name?

I-It's Okuyasu.

Okuyasu?

I'm Josuke's neighbor,
and I'm also a Stand user.

Huh?

A Stand user.

Huh?

A S-t-a-n-d u-s-e-r!

Ah, you can't stand losers?

I'm a Stand user!

Oh, I see! So you're a Stand user.

Must be rough.

By the way, Osomatsu,

I can't seem to find my cane.
Do you know where it is?

Ah!

Sorry about that. It's right in my hand.

Is this geezer okay?

Mr. Joestar.

I've come to carry your luggage.

By the way, Osomatsu, I have a question.

Has Josuke...

Since I didn't even know he was born and

left him alone these past sixteen years,
has he said anything about me?

I can't say that he's said much about that.

I see. So he hasn't...

Yay! It's finally here!

Look, Josuke!

Yeah, that's good, I guess.

To be honest,

I'm sort of hoping he just goes back home.

Josuke...

Well, I mean, I'm glad
he wasn't killed by Otoishi,

and things ended happily ever after.

But you know...

I've never even met this guy before.

I can't really see him as my parent.

I'm sure it's just going to be
awkward for the both of us.

Not that I have a grudge
against him or anything.

But I have to think about
what my mom'll think, too.

Don't you think so, Koichi?

O-Oh, no...

Josuke, there's trouble!

Th-The body!

Jotaro, there's trouble!

Akira Otoishi's body disappeared!

He's still

alive!

There's trouble! The enemy
has boarded the boat!

It appears that Akira Otoishi was not dead!

Seriously?

Take Mr. Joestar...

Who are you?

Huh? Did you say something?

No, he...

I'm the one who said it!

He's not a part of the Speedwagon Foundation!

Wha...

What?!

He's the enemy!

Seriously? You bastard!

Please wait!

I'm the one who told you about the enemy!

Would any enemy actually do that?!

He's the real enemy!

You've got a point.

I'm the one who pointed out the enemy first!

He came to tell you that so
you'd let down your guard!

Th-That's also a good point...

Wh-Which one's the enemy?

He is!

D'oh!

I have to choose again?

Damn it.

This is what I get for relying
on my Big Bro so much...

Okuyasu's easy to deal with.

Jotaro hasn't seen my face yet.

If I can just kill Joseph...

I'm gonna escape!

I'm gonna get the hell out of here!

Chili Pepper!

Huh? What's that about a chilly pigeon?

Rumble

I'll kill you!

I figured out

who it is!

It's you!

Don't think you can fool
Okuyasu Nijimura twice!

H-How did you figure it out?

You wanna know?

How...

I was gonna punch both of you!
I'm not very smart, you know.

Watch...

your step. You're gonna fall into the ocean.

S-Sorry.

If only I had my cane,
I'd be able to get down myself,

but it broke a moment ago...

G-Guess I don't have a choice.

Hold on to my hand.

I just had a great idea!

Why not have Shining Diamond fix the cane?

Y-You idiot! What are you saying?

You're so stupid, Okuyasu.

Huh? Why?

Things are better if he
doesn't fix it this time.

Huh? Why?

Why is that?

Now if we just

retrieve the bow and arrow, it'll all be over,

including the threat to this town.

Episode 13  We Picked Up Something Crazy!

Next on Morioh Radio, we have a
letter from "Troubled Lonesome Boy."

"Kai, listen to this.

I can't get a hold of my girlfriend
at all and it's making me blue."

I wonder if she's mad because
I proposed suddenly.

And I spent all my pay on an engagement
ring with a ruby, her birthstone...

So you were able to successfully
retrieve the bow and arrow.

Yeah, from Akira Otoishi's place.

He'd been committing burglaries with his Stand.

Roughly 500 million yen worth.

The police are still looking into it.

Try doing something with your Stand again.

I'll send you to the ends of
the Earth and kill you there.

I'll be safest in prison!

Chili Pepper's in pieces.

Even if he gets out of jail,
I'm sure he won't try anything again.

Jotaro, what are you going
to do with the bow and arrow?

The Speedwagon Foundation is going
to hold on to it and research it.

It's a crucial piece of evidence we can use
to unravel the mystery behind Stands.

That's great.

Thank goodness!

That means this incident's been resolved!

It didn't end up being that big
a deal, but yay! Hooray!

I'm still questioning Otoishi about the Stand

users that were created here.

Stay on your guard, just in case.

Yeah.
Right.
Sure.

Coffee in Japan is still the best.

Waitress, can I get a refill?

Whoa! Jeez.

Be more careful. I look away for a second and...

Josuke, don't you have to go?
The bus will be here soon.

R-Right...

Yeah. Come on, let's go. Stand up.

I wonder if those two will be okay.

I'm worried.

Whoa, this cake is so good!

Can I get another slice, waitress?

Hello, this is the Higashikata resid—

Hey, Mom. It's me.

Josuke? It's unusual for you to call me.

Do you need something?

Well, uh... Hey, y-you're going
to be home all day today, right?

Yeah? What about it?

N-Nothing! As long as you're
there, it's fine. Bye!

Hey!

What was that all about?

He'd better not be planning
something weird again.

Crap. I hope Mom didn't
think that was weird.

Oh, for crying out loud...

I told him to wait until I was
done with the phone call!

Hey, wait!

Hello? Can you hear me? Hey!

Did you just call for me?

Yeah. We can't get a taxi at this hour,

so we're going to take the bus to my house.

And... I know I'm being pushy, but I'm
going to confirm one more time.

You can only look from a distance.

Make sure you don't talk to my mom!

Promise me that.

My mom won't be happy just
because you came to visit.

She's gonna be a wreck.

I know that. I promise.

Also, one more thing.

I'm gonna be calling you Mr. Joestar.

Huh?

W-Well, you know... I might
as well lay it on the line now.

I mean, it might seem cold,

but calling someone I just met "Dad"
or "Pops" is just not happening.

So after you see my mom, I want
you to go right back to America.

Right...

You're absolutely right. I understand.

Man, this is awkward.

I know it's best to be honest, but still,

there are some things between
people that just aren't possible.

Hey, Mr. Joestar...

Excuse me, did you see where the burly
old man who was just here went?

He got onto that long-distance bus.

Bright Deer
Long Distance Bus
To Sapporo

Y-You can't be serious! Damn it!

I'm sorry about that.

You said we were getting on a bus, so...

But I'm surprised you caught
up to the bus by running.

We were just about to get onto the freeway.

Right now, I'm thinking it might have
been better to just let you go...

To Hokkaido!

Ugh, my stomach hurts.

Sorry about that.

Josuke...

Something seems to be
pulling on my trousers.

Oh, really? Don't let them
drag you off somewhere again.

Wha...

J-Josuke! There's a Stand user nearby!

Yup, there sure is.
Two, in fact... Me and you.

Anyway, is there a vending
machine nearby? I need a drink.

Wh-What is this? They're not footsteps.

Hands? Hand prints?

Oh my God! Josuke, the Stand just laughed!

See? Right here! On top of the sand!

There's no way I'm letting him see my mom.

Now he's seeing and hearing things.

This is concrete!

Where did it go? Where is it? It's gone!

Where did you go? It's gone!

Great. This old man is seriously bad news.

Hermit Purple!

Get out of here, you mutt! Shoo! Shoo!

Do you hear something crying?

It's right here, Josuke.

A baby! There's a naked baby right here.

I can tell when I'm touching it. It's invisible!

What?!

I-It's there!

It's really there!

It's all squishy.

Well, I'll be damned.

It's an invisible baby!

It feels like it's only about
six months old or so.

But how did a baby turn invisible out here?

I'm assuming it's a Stand ability, but...

There are a lot of questions,
like, "Why did the enemy

Stand user make it invisible,"
and "Where is its mom?"

Josuke, I think the baby
is actually the Stand user.

It's a Stand user without realizing it.

Because it's been separated from its
mother, it instinctively went invisible.

Huh?

Even adults can develop ulcers,
spot baldness, and gray hair

before they realize it for
psychological reasons, right?

I believe that finding its mother
will be the way to solve this.

H-Hey, just hurry up and make it stop crying.

I-I'm not really sure what to do, either.

I did something similar to this,
but that was a very long time ago.

There, there...

Th-This is...

Did you figure something out?

Yes, when I just touched it now.

It's a little girl.

Right, the way to tell if it's a boy
or a girl is between the legs!

Did you find out something else?

Josuke,

do you have any tissues?

Th-That smell...

I-Is there one on your hand? A huge one?

I-It's invisible, so I couldn't tell
for sure until I could smell it.

And I just scratched my beard with this hand!

I'm returning your manuscript to you.

I'll be looking forward to those
fixes for the volumes, Sensei.

For the time being, we're gonna
have to get milk and diapers.

And since she's naked,
we need to get her some clothes.

I'm counting on you, Mr. Joestar.

What? I-I'm buying them?

Of course. Look at me.

It'd be too embarrassing
for me to buy baby goods.

There'd be rumors that

a 16-year-old delinquent like
me got some girl pregnant.

But I only have American traveler's checks.

Oh, fine...

You can use my credit card.

Sorry about that.

Don't buy anything too expensive.

I've worked hard to build up my
savings, and I don't have much!

I got it, I got it.

Welcome.

Can I help you find something?

Um... Do you carry disposable diapers?

Of course! Is this your first time here?

Yes, it is, but...

These diapers are easy to change,
even if you're living on your own.

Silky Smooth Underwear
For Adults
You won't have to worry overnight, either.

Um... I'm looking for a baby, not myself.

P-Pardon me! So you're
looking for baby diapers.

Were you looking for cloth diapers,
or disposable pull-ups?

Uh... What was that?

As you can see, this one
will need a diaper cover,

but the disposable pull-up
is simple and economical.

I-I don't really know, so could you just...

What size do you need?

Size?

How old is the baby?

Depending on the baby's size,

we have newborn, S-size, M-size,
L-size, XL-size, boys' and girls'.

Th-There are that many options nowadays?

W-Well, she's a girl, and when
I held her, she was about this big.

What do you mean by "when I held her," sir?

It'd be inconvenient for us
if you bought diapers

that were too big, and then

tried to return them after
they've been pooped in.

Oh, all right. Give me all of the sizes.

I also need baby wipes,
powdered milk, and baby bottles...

For baby bottles, we have glass or plastic.

Huh?

Glass ones don't scratch or
start to smell as easily,

but they are a bit heavy for a baby to hold.

The plastic ones are light,
but may have a noticeable smell.

Which one would you like?

U-U-Uh... Um...

We also have various shapes and designs.

We have ones shaped like
rocket ships and racing cars.

This one, the baby can hold by itself.

And this one, if you turn it
upside-down, the doll inside moves.

I-I have no idea, so if you
could just throw in a few...

And which bottle nipples
would you like, sir?

Rubber ones are soft,
but don't last very long.

Silicon ones last, but are a bit hard.

This one is called a "Chupatoreni."

There's a diaphragm where
the nipple goes in the mouth,

and the flow of milk is adjusted
by how hard the baby sucks on it.

This is a NUK from Germany.

The shape is slightly flattened, and is said to

more closely resemble
a mother's natural shape.

And just like when drinking breast
milk, it will not come out

unless they use their jaws.

O-Oh, all right. Whatever is fine.
Just give me all of them.

As for the nipple holes, we have round,
Y-shaped, and cross-shaped varieties.

J-Just give me all of them.

And some baby clothes and socks, too.

I'll be paying by card.

Thank you very much, sir.

130,000... I don't really
understand yen that well.

I wonder how much that is in dollars.

If 100 yen is about 80 cents...

Well, whatever.

I didn't waste any money,
and it's just baby stuff.

I'm sure it can't be that expensive.

Damn it...

What's he doing? He's taking forever.

By the way...

The girl who got the ring.
I wonder what happened with that.

Since he didn't get an answer,
I wonder if that was a no.

They could be super conflicted about it.

I can't stay here...

If people from school find me here...

Sorry to keep you waiting, Josuke.

Here's your card back.

You're done? A-All right, let's go.

Now we won't have to worry
about losing sight of her, but...

If strangers see that she doesn't
have a face, they'll be creeped out.

I thought about that and...

bought some makeup, too.

Let's try some foundation first. There we go!

Hey, I think she might actually be cute.

My, what a beauty!

This face will help us find her mom.

We've finally got some hope. We can do this!

That was a good idea!

Good, good! All right,
now let's try some lipstick.

And let's draw on some eyebrows
and eyelashes... Like that.

I knew he'd do that...

So this geezer's the type to get carried
away when you compliment him.

Now we can finally take you around
without having to worry too much.

We can't put makeup on your eyes,
so we'll just have to use sunglasses.

That looks great!

Here's some milk.

Maybe I went too light on the foundation.

It looks like it's starting to come off...

Th-That's not it!

What is this?! Sh-She's...

Sh-She disappeared! And so did my hands!

This baby's not just making herself invisible!

She's making everything
around her invisible, too!

Mr. Joestar! Let go of the baby!

I'm telling you to hurry up
and let go of the baby!

Th-They're still invisible,
even though I let go of her.

She's powering up!

This isn't good.

It looks like everything within
about thirty centimeters

of that baby is becoming invisible.

But this doesn't make sense.

If she keeps trying to protect
herself with her Stand,

who could even feed her or take care of her?

So it must be due to feelings of anxiety.

It's stress.

She doesn't want to be touched
by someone she doesn't know.

If she powers up any more,
no one will be able to get near her.

We'll end up invisible, too.

That's some weird junk.
I wonder who's gonna clean it up.

Well, I guess someone will do it.

Not me, though.

Look out!

What happened?

This lit cigarette butt was...
Oh, you can't see it.

What the hell are you doing, Mr. Joestar?!

Don't space out at a time like this!

I, uh...

The stroller completely disappeared!

And the ground, too!

So it is stress!

The more scared she gets,
the wider her range gets!

That's the sound of the stroller flipping over!

The invisible baby... fell into the water?!

Wh-Where is she? Make some noise!

I can't even see any bubbles! Where is she?!

J-Josuke...

Shut up!

This all happened because he
couldn't keep it together.

That stupid old geezer!

This irresponsible guy is my father?

He's so irresponsible, he was okay with
abandoning my mom for sixteen years.

There's no way in hell I can
respect someone like him.

There's no way we can get along.

You stay out of this.

Where is she? She should
be right around here.

I don't care if I turn invisible, too.

Just hurry up and touch me!

Come on!

She's not here... Hurry!

Damn it! How the hell am I supposed to find

an invisible baby in clear water?!

Josuke, I...

might die in just a moment,
so when that happens,

please give my regards to your mother.

I mean...

I am quite old now.

What the hell are you doing?!

I'm adding color to the water...

It's the center...

The color of the blood is turning
more and more invisible.

The child is in the center.

Mr. Joestar...

No one else would think to do this.

Not for someone else's child,
who they've never seen before...

They wouldn't go this far.

I wanted to look cool

in front of you.

Episode 14
Let's Go to the Manga Artist's House, Part 1

Episode 14
Let's Go to the Manga Artist's House, Part 1Today was another exhausting day.

I just want to hurry home so I can relax.

K-Koichi...

Hazamada...

Hey, how are you doing?

Th-Thanks for everything the other day.

Um, are you all healed up now?

Kinda. I was released from
the hospital two days ago.

Where's that bastard—
I mean, where's Josuke?

He already went home.

Apparently, he found an
invisible baby yesterday,

and there was a big fuss
over finding her mother.

Is she a Stand user?

Apparently.

The baby has only warmed up to
Josuke's father, Mr. Joestar,

and if he's not around, she turns
everything around her invisible.

So is Mr. Joestar going to be
in town for a while, then?

Probably.

I see. By the way, Koichi,
do you like to read manga?

Manga? Oh, I guess about as much as anyone.

Have you heard of Rohan Kishibe,
who draws Pink Dark Boy?

Pink Dark Boy? Of course!

I'm a huge fan!

Yeah? You like it?

I guess you'd call it "horror suspense."

There are some pretty gross scenes,

but the thrills that seem to close in on you

and the realistic characters
are great, aren't they?

Right, right!

Did you know that Rohan Kishibe
actually lives in Morioh?

Huh?!

What?! He lives in Morioh?!

No way! You can't be serious! Really?!

I couldn't believe it, either!

But I happened to overhear
some realtors talking.

I know it seems unbelievable, but it's true!

Hey, want to go see if we
can get some autographs?

Morioh Station

Yes! Of course I'll go!
Rohan Kishibe's House

Looks like we think alike!

Really?

Kishibe

Over there!

I think that might be his studio.

The light's on!

You're right...

I wonder if he has any other family.

I heard he lives alone.

He debuted at sixteen, and now he's twenty.

Twenty?! He's so young!

So he became a pro at my age.

There's no point in snooping around, Koichi.

Try ringing the doorbell.

M-Me?

Oh, come on! I'm ordering
you, as an older student.

I tend to get pretty nervous.

What? That's not fair...

Episode 14  Let's Go to the Manga Artist's House, Part 1

That face!

Rohan Kishibe!

He looks just like his picture
in the New Year's deluxe edition!

Uh, I mean... Rohan-sensei!

H-Huh?

Who are you two?

What are you doing? Playing a prank?

N-No! We would never!

Um, we're students at Budogaoka High School.

W-We're fans of yours, Sensei.

Fans? Of mine? You're readers?

So my address has gotten out.

N-No, um... I just happened to overhear it.

So, I know this is sudden,

but it would make us really happy
if we could get your autograph.

Fans of mine, eh?

That's good.

We might be on the same wavelength, then.

Huh?

Nothing, never mind. Pardon.

An autograph or two is no problem at all.

Yes! I guess it's a good thing we came.

I know.

Since you're here, would you
like a tour of my studio?

Huh?

You'll let us go into your studio?!

I'm already done with my work for
the day, so if you two would like...

Of course!

Then...

Pardon the intrusion!

Come in.

Wow!

Wow! Raw 4-color manuscript!

This is amazing! It has so much more impact!

I-I'm so moved! I-I-I'm so glad that we came!

How long have you been working in Morioh?

I moved here three months ago.

My family home is in S City,

but I lived here for a time when I was a child.

Tokyo is very convenient,
but it's pretty chaotic.

The environment is nowhere near

as calm as it is in Morioh,
and I can't work there.

Not to mention,

with the fax machines and
copiers we have these days,

I have a system where, given four hours,

I can send in a complete manuscript.

You could say there's no point in living in

the city now, other than for pointless status.

Um... So what do you do
for assistants or staff?

I don't have any. I draw it all by myself.

Huh? All by yourself?!

You draw 19 pages of such
elaborate art in just one week?!

I can draw them in four days.
Five if there are color pages.

What?!

On the remaining days, I have
fun going on trips and such.

I don't really like dealing with people,

and that's why I chose to be a manga artist.

If I had an assistant,
it'd be harder for me to work.

That's so amazing... Wow.

You're a genius!

Pardon me for a moment.

Whoa, a s-spider!

We really are out in the burbs.

There are a lot of bugs and spiders.

Um... Sensei?

I see... So this spider is
an Araneus ventricosus...

It can be found in houses and
mountainous regions all across Japan.

Though it is an orb-weaver,

there are some that make webs day and night.

By the way,

do you two know what it takes
to draw an interesting manga?

Reality!

Reality is the energy that breathes
life into a piece of work,

and reality itself is entertainment.

People often think that manga are
drawn from imagination and fantasy,

but that's not actually true!

For me, drawing something
that I've experienced,

or something that has moved me,
is what makes it interesting!

For example, in the city, people would just
be grossed out by this spider and kill it.

As a manga artist, you need to
know how its legs are connected,

where the eyes are, and how to tell
the difference between a male

and a female in order to be able to draw it.

Apparently a spider's webbing hardens
when it's exposed to the air,

but you have to know what
hole it comes from,

and what its innards look like.

When a spider's belly is cut upon,
how does it suffer before it dies?

You have to know these things
for the sake of reality.

That's so cruel!

Cruel?!

An amateur brat like you is
criticizing me, Rohan Kishibe?!

N-No! I wasn't criticizing at all! I'm sorry!

I should have a taste, too.

Manga artists are really strange people,
just as the world perceives them!

Very nice! That agonized expression...

Perfect example of how one looks when puking!

I should sketch it.

R-Really?

Now it looks fake.

Forget it. I won't sketch it.

It won't be of any use.

I-I'm sorry.

Autographs, wasn't it?

I'll go get a signing pen from the kitchen,

and bring out some tea, as well.

Oh, you don't have to...

But that's amazing! I had no idea...

Pink Dark Boy must be so amazing

because of how far he goes to
figure out all kinds of things...

Um, Hazamada...

I know we just got here, but, um...

Maybe we should go home.

Huh? Go home? You want to go home? Why?

This is a lot of fun!

I don't really have a reason, but...

I guess you could call it a hunch.

Though I'm not usually that perceptive...

I just suddenly got the feeling that
Rohan-sensei is a bit dangerous.

Dangerous?

Do you mean that he might be a Stand user?

No! Nothing like that. Just, um...

Just because Rohan-sensei's a bit unusual,

I don't think you should just
assume that he's a Stand user.

I'm not assuming that he is...

I just said I have a bad feeling.

Besides, if Rohan-sensei
actually is a Stand user,

wouldn't that be great for us?

That means I have something in common
with a famous manga artist.

But, all right.

If you have a bad feeling,
we can go home for today.

We can always come again.

But!

Only after I've looked at this
thing that caught my eye.

Thing? What thing?

Jeez, you're dense, Koichi!

On top of the desk, next to the phone.

Look carefully.

Oh! C-Could this be...

Yup! He said he just finished working, right?

I've been eyeing that carefully.

A manuscript for Pink Dark Boy
that's just been finished?!

Does that mean no one else
has even seen it yet?!

Once I get a glimpse of this, we can go home.

We should get permission first.

Koichi, you don't know manga artists at all.

These manuscripts, before
they've gone to the printers,

are a closely-guarded trade secret!

There's no way he'd let us outsiders read a

manuscript that hasn't even
been checked by the editor yet!

I'll have a look, then put it right back.

That's an even worse idea!

It's fine! It's not like it can hurt anything.

Huh?

What is this feeling?

It's always a thrilling manga, but is
this the impact of a raw manuscript?

I'm getting goosebumps!

It's so good!

Hurry up and turn the page, Hazamada.

I'm so moved!

It appears

that my manuscript was compatible
with you two after all.

I thought you would read it.

And only those who are the first to read
my manuscript, and are compatible...

H-Hazamada...

K-Koichi...

...will have their hearts opened
by my ability, Heaven's Door!

A-Ability?!

My hand!

K-Koichi! What's going on?!

Morioh Landmark 5
Manga Artist Rohan Kishibe's House
Get off at the Morioh Kotodai 2-chome
bus stop and walk 1 minute.
Area: A mansion situated on 103 tsubo of land.
7LDK plus an attic.
If you actually go, he'll pretend to be out.

There are a lot of things
recorded in the human body.

Everything from the moment you were born.

In order to read that, I will
turn you both into books.

Books that have your lives written in them.

Help!

You read the manga too, didn't you?

It's happening to me, too!

Hazamada!

This will cause you no actual
harm, so don't worry.

Wh-What are you trying to do?!

I told you earlier that for manga, the author's
sense of reality is important, right?

Which means reading about your lives and

experiences will offer me realistic ideas.

You can't get this from interviews!

You're going to tell me 100% realistically,
as if I had experienced it myself.

Koichi Hirose. Born March 28th, 1984,
at 6:27 AM at Red Cross Hospital in S City.

You were born premature at 2325 grams,
and spent a week in an incubator.

You're from a family of four,
and your older sister's name is Ayana...

I see...

It appears that your grade school and
middle school days were pretty ordinary,

and your personality is very honest.

That's very commendable.

You...

What is this ability that you have?! Reverb?

Someone other than me has an ability like this?!

You, too?

"Stand users!" This is...

Everything from April of 1999 on is amazing!

You've only had amazing
experiences ever since!

Josuke Higashikata, Jotaro Kujo,

Yukako Yamagishi, Okuyasu
Nijimura, Tamami Kobayashi...

I can't believe it...

This is amazing! It's so entertaining!

I just discovered the best material a manga
artist could hope for, Koichi Hirose!

Shining Diamond,

Star Platinum,

The Hand, Love Deluxe, et cetera, et cetera!

Wh-What do you plan on doing with us?!

I'm going to take your memories

so I can use them as material for my manga!

Reverb!

Please stop attacking us
with your Stand immediately!

Otherwise...

Are you going to have Reverb
Act 2 attack me with sound?

Yes! Please release me from your Stand!

I won't hold back!

I know. It's written on your 11th page.

You're far more timid than most people
and taken rather lightly by others,

but when it's necessary, you have
courage that can overpower your fear.

Truly magnificent!

I'm very impressed with you!

I'm sure my readers will
like your personality, too.

I'm not bluffing! I'm really
going to attack you!

Oh, shut up...

And just try it!

Reverb Act 2!

Crash

Crash

Huh? I-I missed?!

Did you accidentally miss
or did you miss on purpose?

Your control is way off!

Then how about this?!

Crash

Where are you attacking?!

Koichi, sadly for you, I have
put a safety lock on Reverb.

Huh?

You are now unable to attack me.

Safety lock?

Look... I've already written it into
your 11th page, right here.

I can not attack the manga
artist, Rohan Kishibe

I can not
attack the
manga
artist,
Rohan
Kishibe.

c

n

can not

This is Heaven's Door's ability.

It lets me read people's experiences
via words and pictures,

and it also allows me to
write into your memories.

You will now never be able to harm
me in any way, shape, or form.

Wh-What?!

But that's all I'm going to mess with.

If I write in any more,
it'll make your life fake,

so it wouldn't benefit my work at all.

Let's see... I guess I'll
have a look at Hazamada, too.

Sensei! You are a genius! I admire you!

Huh... I see.

Let's see...

You sometimes feel relief after you've

picked on things weaker than yourself,
like kittens and small birds.

You want to force yourself on Junko from 3-E,

but you're too cowardly, so you can't.

Your balls often get sweaty,

and when you're adjusting them during class,

nothing gives you a greater thrill than
the thought that someone might see you.

You're an awful man.

There's no way my readers would like
you if I wrote you into my manga.

You're useless.

No fair! There's no hope for me!

Why?

Why are you doing this?

Even without reading about my experiences,
you're an amazing manga artist!

The world knows that!

You're living in this amazing
house at the age of twenty!

You're doing much better
than most people your age!

And yet, why do you need my memories?!

Do you think that I,
Rohan Kishibe, draw manga

for the sake of money and attention?!

I'm drawing manga so people will read it!

So someone will read it!
That's the only reason!

It's a very simple reason, but I
don't care about anything else!

So that people will read it,
I look for realistic material every day!

Listen well. Whenever I finish
a manuscript, I feel amazing.

Everyone feels great after
finishing work, don't they?

But that feeling only lasts for an instant.

It's only a little while,

because I start thinking that no one's
going to read my completed manga,

and my insecurities start to grow.

Then I get even more insecure
because, maybe next week,

no one's going to read it, and
then I might not know what

to draw anymore, and I might not
feel like doing anything anymore.

These feelings have been reoccurring
over and over since I was sixteen.

Until three months ago,
when someone shot me with an arrow,

and I gained the ability of Heaven's Door.

Keicho Nijimura...

Yes, that was also written in you.

I'm sure you two don't understand
the feeling of having found

the best material to use
for drawing a masterpiece!

But this is it, right now!

It's the best!

Koichi, I'm going to make your reality mine!

See, Koichi? Wasn't Rohan-sensei a great guy?

Aren't you glad we went?

Yeah! It was so much fun!

To Hirose
Rohan Kishibe
Not only did he give us
these great autographs,

he even served us tea and cookies.

I'd love to go again.

Yeah. Let's definitely go again.

Well, I'm heading this way, so...

He really was a great guy.

You'll never speak of this, Koichi.

Huh?!

Wh-Why?!

How did I lose 20 kilograms?

But I don't look any different!

It reads five kilograms...

The scale's not broken.

Th-This is impossible!

Th-This has to be the work
of an enemy Stand user!

Otherwise, there's no way
I'd lose 20 kilograms!

But who...

I need to talk to Josuke about this.

What's the matter, Ko?

Huh?

Me? U-Uh...

Wait... What was it?

What are you talking about? Weirdo.

What's wrong?

Oh, nothing. My little brother's
wandering around in his underwear.

What was it?

I could have sworn I thought about
something really important just now.

Well, if I forgot about it,
it can't be that important.

Man, my shoes and bag sure feel heavy today.

Huh?

Th-This house...

Why?

I somehow ended up walking to
Rohan-sensei's house without realizing it.

The door's open...

I'd like to stop by and thank him for yesterday,

but then I'd be late for school.
It's probably a bad idea.

He might actually still be asleep
since he's a manga artist.

I really shouldn't just barge into his house.

It's really not a good idea...

Hey, did you see that, Okuyasu?

Yeah...

We followed Koichi because
he was heading in the

opposite direction of the school,
but what the heck is he doing?

Whose house is that?

I have my doubts, but it's
not some chick, is it?

Rohan-sensei...

He's working so frantically.

But I wonder what it is...

I can't shake the feeling that
being here is actually terrifying.

What is it?

I'm glad you came.

I've been waiting for you.
You're right on time.

Episode 15

Episode 15
Let's Go to the Manga Artist's House, Part 2What was it?

I've had this feeling ever since last night
that I'm supposed to do something...

Man, my shoes and bag sure feel heavy today.

Huh?

Th-This house...

Why?

I somehow ended up walking to
Rohan-sensei's house without realizing it.

The door's open...

I'd like to stop by and
thank him for yesterday,

but then I'd be late for school.
It's probably a bad idea.

He might still be asleep,

I really shouldn't just barge into his house.

Rohan-sensei...

He's working so frantically.

But I wonder what it is...

I can't shake the feeling that
being here is actually terrifying.

What is it?

I'm glad you came.

I've been waiting for you.

You're right on time.

Huh?

However, could I ask you
to wait a little while?

Two more pages, and I'll be done
with the manuscript for next week.

I think I'll be done in about twenty minutes.

Twenty minutes?

Did he just say he'd finish
two pages in twenty minutes?

Did I hear him wrong?

Two totally blank pages of
manuscript in twenty minutes?

No way... And he said next week's?

We only just read this week's manuscript
yesterday, and he'd just finished it.

What?! You're not going to do pencils first?!

I-I can't believe it...

He didn't even draw that
complicated story in pencil first!

It's getting more and more complete...
And he's even drawing the backgrounds with it!

Wh-What was that just now?!

I couldn't really see it. What did he do?!

What?! H-He's doing the beta!

He's flinging ink around like shurikens,

and hitting exactly the right spots
without going out of the lines!

Th-This technique...

Aren't you supposed to fill in beta
by hand with a brush?!

Boom

He's already done with the beta!

It's only been about two minutes
since the page was completely white!

It's all thanks to you, Koichi.

The urge to work keeps welling up in me!

I want to draw so bad, I can't help it!

I just want to keep drawing!

This is the first time I've been able

to draw nineteen pages in one night!

I'm drawing a masterpiece right now!

Your experiences are amazing!

It's because I'm using your experience
as the source of my story, Koichi!

Huh?

What...

Hurry! I want your next reality!

Let me see your next page!

The more pages I take,
the more weight you'll lose,

but you don't care, right?

Because you're going to become
a masterpiece and live forever!

Flip

I-I remember now!

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable

Hey, now...

Episode 15  Let's Go to the Manga Artist's House, Part 2

I've managed to make a book

from a single panel rather
than an entire work!

This is amazing!

I'm growing as a manga
artist and as a Stand user!

I'm going read this now, Koichi.

Oh, my...

Those faces belong to Shining
Diamond's Josuke Higashikata

and The Hand's Okuyasu Nijimura.

How curious.

Why would those two be at my house?

There's no way Koichi would
tell those two about me.

How strange...

Huh?

I-It's Josuke and Okuyasu!

I'm not sure how they found
out I was here, but...

N-Now they can save me somehow!

Somehow...

I have to get them to save me!

Huh? Okuyasu and Josuke?

How did you know I was here?

Now, then...

Right now, I don't have any
interest in Josuke and Okuyasu.

I'm just going to finish up the
last two pages for next week,

and steal even more material from Koichi!

I'm so excited!

Huh? You were watching a
manga artist do his work?

This is where that manga artist works?

Rohan Kishibe?

Is he famous or something?

Have you heard of him, Josuke?

Nah. Even that bastard Hazamada

made fun of me for not
knowing what Perman was.

That wasn't it.

That wasn't what I wanted
to say to them just now.

But what was it?

Well, we were following you
because we were worried

since you were just wandering around,

but if nothing's wrong, then good. I'm relieved.

Thanks.

Do you want to come inside
and watch with me?

Nah, I'll pass.

I'd get nervous around somebody famous.

Same here.

I'm just satisfied knowing that you

didn't come here to meet some chick.

See ya, Koichi.

Okay.

I know I'm forgetting something.

I know I forgot to tell them
something really important.

I remember now!

I-I was going to ask for help!

Josuke! Okuyasu!

I'll head to school soon!

Sure!

Don't be late.

Got it!

N-No!

That's not what I wanted to say!

I can not attack the manga
artist, Rohan Kishibe

can not

It's no use! I can't ask them for help.

C-Can there be a Stand as terrifying as this?!

Heaven's Door is way too strong!
There's no way to attack it!

Scribble Scribble Scribble

Ah, I see...

Scribble Scribble Scribble

At this rate, he's going to rip
everything out of me and kill me!

Stop

Someone's coming into this mansion!

What did you do downstairs just now, Koichi?

Huh?

Okuyasu!

Whoa, there! Don't you dare turn around.

Try anything funny, and I'll crush
you with my Stand, you little shit.

Okuyasu!

I don't know how you knew that
I was in danger, but I'm so happy!

It appears he figured it out coincidentally.

I just realized, but the wound on your hand

must have signaled him
that something was wrong.

It looks like you scratched it or
caught it on something while crawling.

I-I was so absorbed, I didn't even notice...

That's how you figured it out,
right, Okuyasu Nijimura?

Stand name: The Hand...

You have a complex regarding
your dead brother, Keicho,

and whenever you try to make a decision,

you wish that your brother were there.

Wha...

What? Who the hell is this guy?

Hey, Koichi, tell me what
this guy's Stand is!

W-Well...

I-I can't!

I can't say anything that'll put
Rohan Kishibe at a disadvantage.

If you see even one panel, you lose!

I want to tell you not to look!

Don't look at that manga!

Hey, I told you not to move!

Okuyasu, I wasn't interested in you,

but now that you're in
this house, I have no choice.

I'll have to turn you into material, too.

You bastard!

What?!

H-He's fast!

Okuyasu!

What the hell is this?!

you're there, aren't you?

Okuyasu!

What the hell is up with this manga artist?

Oh, shut up.

Now, then... Koichi,
I have a question for you.

Huh?

Why do you think Josuke Higashikata

is hiding behind that door there?

Well? What do you think?

Why won't he come out, Koichi?

Josuke is hiding so he won't see your manga.

Yes, that is correct. You're pretty smart.

Okuyasu Nijimura there didn't
know about my Heaven's Door,

so I was able to trick him.

But unfortunately, because of that, Josuke
Higashikata now knows who I really am.

On that point, I feel I'm seriously,

no, without a doubt, put at
a very big disadvantage.

There's also another reason that Josuke
Higashikata is hiding behind the door.

What do you think that is?

In order to prevent that from happening,

I have to somehow drag him
out from behind that door.

He's in the middle of trying to figure
out how he's going to kill you!

That's also true.

But it's not the exact answer I'm looking for.

The correct answer is...

Josuke Higashikata is contemplating whether

he should flee this mansion alone or not.

Josuke would never do that!

Right, Koichi.

It was written in your files that
Josuke Higashikata's personality

would never allow him to abandon you two.

But you see, manga artists
have a habit of thinking about

every conceivable possibility
because of their job.

Like, what are all of the possible actions

that the protagonist can
take in this situation?

In this case, having Josuke run away
now that he knows who I really am

is truly troublesome to me.

Run... Actually, that might be a good idea.

He'd be able to get Jotaro,

and if Yukako finds out
what's happening to Koichi,

she'll be super pissed off.

Ah! We could win with her hair!

Though I don't want to see her!

Do that, Josuke! Hurry up and let them know!

You fools!

I explained that to you
so that it wouldn't happen!

Okuyasu! I already wrote that into your body!

Huh?

I'll allow you to explain what I wrote
in there to those two, Koichi.

No!

What's written there, Koichi?

B-But that's... No...

We can't run anymore!

You can't run away from this!

I'm asking you what's written there, Koichi!

If Josuke Higashikata makes
trouble for Rohan Kishibe,
I will commit suicide
by self-immolation

If Josuke Higashikata makes
trouble for Rohan Kishibe,
I will commit suicide
by self-immolation

S-Suicide?!

You'll commit suicide if
Josuke even tries to help us!

H-Hey, hey! I'll commit
suicide by self-immolation?

Don't be stupid! Like I'd die
in such a horrific way!

Huh?

But you will! He's invincible!

We can't defy him, no matter what!

Stop! My right hand!

So you've come out.

It's not that he came out,
but he was basically dragged out.

Ah... That's rather childish and simple,
but it might be quite effective.

This room is small and
there's nowhere to run.

If you can defeat me in a single blow,
Heaven's Door will disappear,

and Okuyasu won't commit suicide.

Josuke!

Closing his eyes is pretty simple,
but it might be a good idea.

As long as he doesn't see the manuscript,
Heaven's Door is powerless.

Just come charging straight in like that!

Which means...

I just need to open your eyes somehow.

Oh! He was able to withstand that.

This isn't good...

If he comes charging at me, I'll be finished.

If I were a protagonist in a manga,
what would I do in this situation?
seconds

How would I get him to open his eyes?

Go, Josuke!

Hurry up, Josuke!

I know!

There was something written in Koichi's file...

There! This is it!

I'm going to laugh at your hairstyle, Josuke!

That's from, like, twenty or thirty years ago!

You actually think that's cool?

How's that?

Looks like he gets angry if I say that.

It's sort of hard to believe,
but the file doesn't lie.

It's 100% true.

What did you say just now?

J-Josuke, calm down!

Just try and say that one more time!

You opened them...

Didn't you hear me?

It appears that you think
that hairstyle is cool,

but it doesn't look good on you at all.

It's lame!

Though a dirty little bird might
like to make your head its nest.

That's just a maybe, though.

Heaven's Door!

I've won.

Huh?!

What?!

Wh-What was that?

I-I know that I opened his eyes
and showed him the manuscript!

W-We're back to normal!

I'm certain that I showed it to him... Why?

Where the hell did you fly off to?!

Come back out here, damn it!

No, he totally didn't see...

He didn't see?

Do you mean that he's so worked up,

he doesn't even know what he's doing?

Where are you hiding, you dumbass?!

Get out here!

Yeah... He's the kind of guy that loses sight

of everything, even that manuscript,
when someone disses his hair.

I had no idea he actually got this mad.

This is way worse than I imagined.

What?

S-Something about Josuke's personality
that Koichi didn't know?

That means it's information
that's not in the file!

Why? Why does he get so
mad about his hairstyle?

There has to be a reason... Why?

I won't forgive anyone who disses my hair!

I won't keep quiet, no matter who it is!

The reason behind his hair...

I think I heard a little about it before.

That just might be why...

Huh? What are you talking about?

It has to do with when
Josuke was a kid, but...

This story is going to include my own

guesses about why this happened.

Apparently, when Josuke was four,

he passed out from an
inexplicable high fever,

and for fifty days, they weren't
sure whether he'd live or die.

Josuke...

He found out later that it
was right around the time

when Jotaro and Mr. Joestar

went to Egypt to defeat the man named DIO.

But at the time, they had
no idea it happened,

so Josuke's mom drove him
to a hospital in S City.

But on that day, Morioh was hit with
its worst blizzard in 18 years.

It's no use... What should I do?

Cars don't come by here often,

and there are no pay phones.

I should have called an
ambulance at the house.

I shouldn't have brought
Josuke out in this snow.

That's when it happened.

Wh-What do you want? Go away!

That kid is sick, right?
I'll push your car for you.

Huh?

Hurry up and
step on the gas.

Once you get moving,
don't stop. Just keep going...
Or your tires will get stuck in the snow again.

O-Okay...

Thank you!

His mom looked for that boy later,

but couldn't find a single lead.

Though the boy didn't personally
save Josuke's life,

the four-year-old Josuke
thought that what the boy did

made him his hero.

He's an inspiration that's
burned into his heart,

and his example of how to live.

So when someone insults that,

something deep in his heart snaps.

I don't know who he is,

but I admire him so much
that I copied his hairstyle.

And I won't forgive anyone who insults it,

because it's the same as insulting him.

I think that story might be the reason.

Though I thought Josuke was making it up,

so I wasn't listening very carefully.

Huh... I had no idea something
like that happened.

Rohan's holding a pen!

Bastard! You're going to try again?!

N-No...

I-I wanted to sketch this and write
a memo before I lost consciousness.

What a wonderful story! And I just
experienced something amazing.

I'm so happy.

I don't get to experience
something like this often.

If I can make it work in my own project...

I'm so lucky.

I'm so glad I moved to Morioh.

It's no use.

Until he dies, he'll keep trying
to use anything as material

for his manga, no matter how
horrible the experience.

At this point, you have to commend him.

Putting good and bad aside,
I have to admire that attitude.

He really is a super manga artist.

There you are, manga artist!

I'm not done punching you!

You sort of have to commend him, too.

Y-Yeah...

Sorry!

Episode 16
Let's Go Hunting!Josuke, I'm about to go hunting.

Huh?

Come with me.

Huh?

W-Wait a sec, Jotaro.
Did you just say "hunting"?

Does that mean...

We're gonna be hunting down
some chicks with nice bodies?

I'm a guy who's more into pure love,
so I've never done that.

I wonder if I can do it...

Akira Otoishi confessed yesterday.

Otoishi did?!

Before his identity was revealed,
he was using the bow and arrow.

He happened to shoot a rat with the arrow.

A rat?!

The rat didn't die after it was shot.

It writhed in pain and
freed itself from the arrow,

then ran away.

So even though it's a rat, this means that

it has definitely obtained Stand abilities.

I'm not sure what kind of Stand it is,

but we have to hunt it down
before something happens.

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable

Episode 16    Let's Go Hunting!

Wow, kewl!

Getting a small, quick rat into your
Stand's range will be difficult,

but by using the bearings, your range
will increase to about 20 meters.

This should be obvious, but it
won't work against a Stand.

You'll only be able to use it to defeat the user.

Try it.

What? I have to do it, too?

I don't know... My mind tends to wander
when ball-shaped things are involved.

The second one was so close!

Not bad. I'd give it 85 points.

But before our pursuit,
I'll give you a warning.

When dealing with living creatures,

you need to put composure ahead of speed.

If the rat enters your range and you miss,

it won't ever step into your range again.

So don't fire until you're positive you'll hit it.

I'm not trying to put pressure
on you, but remember that.

I'm feeling plenty pressured now.

Apparently, Akira Otoishi shot the rat

near this irrigation canal.

Given the area, it was probably a brown rat.

Brown rats can swim,
live anywhere, and eat anything.

The big ones reach about
20 to 30 centimeters long,

and some can weigh one kilogram.

They can jump about 2 meters.

Found it.

Aren't those a bird's tracks?

Their front paws have four digits,
and the back ones have five.

It's dragging something,
forming this S-shape.

This line was made by its tail.

It's a rat that's around 20 centimeters long.

I'm not sure how many,
but they're definitely here.

There's a tick on this leaf.

That means rats come through here often.

Without a doubt, there's a nest
deep in that drainage channel.

For now, we'll set a trap
here and video tape it.

That's one of those cameras that let you
watch while you're taping, right?

You're not using cheese for the trap?

It's a crumb of tempura.

Cheese is too extravagant for rats.

There sure are a lot of flies...

Jotaro!

Th-This is...

Rat corpses?

It's exactly what it looks like!

It's like the jelly from stewed fish.

Why the heck are you poking at it?!

It's flesh.

The flesh of these rats was melted
once, then hardened again.

And they died from having the flesh
under their skin melted.

What do you even do to leave
behind a corpse like this?

I'm not sure...

But we can probably assume it's the
work of the rat that we're after.

It used its Stand?

It killed the others and
made their territory its own.

Which means...

It's definitely making a nest at
the end of this drainage channel.

But the question is

if something capable of doing
this will just stay quiet.

Looks like the drainage
channel leads to that farm.

We might already be too late.

R-Really?

They have a chicken coop,
but there aren't any chickens.

There are no signs of life
at the house, either.

It doesn't look like they just went out,
and the front door isn't locked.

The rat is there.

And just as I feared,

it's likely that the people living
there have already been killed.

Let's go check out that house.

The rat will let us approach
within a certain distance,

because it's confident that no
slow human is going to catch it.

It's not expecting us to blast bearings at it.

That's how we'll get close
enough to nail it in one shot.

Found something.

Rat droppings.

Not made up of grass or grain, either.

It's meat.

They're heading toward this room.

Let's check it out.

Right.

What is that?

The sound of a refrigerator's compressor?

What the heck?

Does the refrigerator in
this house open on its own?

Has the magnet in the door weakened?

What?! There it is!

Damn it! It's right there!

That's what opened the refrigerator just now!

Can rats actually open refrigerator doors?!

Nah... Someone living here must
not have shut the door all the way.

And... Am I actually naïve
enough to believe that?

This rat is a Stand user!

Jo—

Jotaro's not here!

He went to the next room.

Great. Now our eyes have met.

Th-This is...

Did that rat do this?!

They're still alive...

Are you telling me that rat used
its Stand to turn the owners

into this, then preserved them in the fridge?

And it's eating them!

Damn it... Jotaro's not coming back.

That means I'm gonna have to kill this thing.

When dealing with living creatures,

I need to put composure ahead of speed, right?

If I don't get it in one try,
it'll figure out my range.

That's what he said, right? Damn it...

Talk about pressure!

From here, the table and chair
are slightly in the way.

I'm gonna make sure I blast this
bearing right into your forehead.

Stay right there for a bit...

Shit! It stopped eating.

If I move any more, it might run away!

I have no choice! It'll be an adventure,

but I'm gonna have to shoot from here!

It's moving! Now!

Crush

Yes!

It wasn't a fatal blow!

There it is!

That must be its Stand!

You're gonna try to attack me?

Don't underestimate me!

I'll get you with the next shot!

Crap! It's running under the table to get away!

I'm not going to let you!

Jotaro, what are you doing?!

The rat's here!

That shape...

Shit! It's a Stand that shoots something!

What should I do? Slap it
away with my bare hands?

But that's gross, so maybe not...

Which is it?

Did I hit it, or did I miss?

You bastard!

Yes! I nailed it!

I didn't hit it in the forehead, but I beat it.

That was close...

Jotaro, over here!

I got the rat! It's over!

Jeez. What were you doing?

You went missing at the most crucial time.

I felt totally stranded.

But wouldn't you know it...

I just barely made the bearing shot.

I wasn't trying to do a pun with "barely" there.

It had a Stand that shot
something like needles.

I bet if they hit you, they melt your flesh.

The people who live here got hit,
but they're still alive.

I can fix them with Shining Diamond.

If we don't take care of this by sundown,

we may have a problem.

Huh?

There's one more. I was just attacked by it.

Jotaro! Y-Your hand...

I was hit in the next room.

I could have dodged it...

Grabbing it to figure out the effects
of those needles was a mistake.

Just by touching the needle,

some kind of "Stand poison" courses
through you, melting even Stands.

Getting hit by five or six of those

would be enough to turn
a human into mush.

Thank goodness I dodged!

I'm lucky our personalities are so different.

That rat ran outside afterward.

It must've figured out that you
finished off the one in the kitchen.

I hate to ask, but I'm sort of waiting
for you to fix me up quickly.

O-Oh, right!

Damn it!

Why does there have to be another one?

Hello, this is the Speedwagon
Foundation research team.

Hello, this is Jotaro Kujo.

Jotaro!

We've tried to call you several times already.

I was in pursuit, so my ringer was off.

Does it have to do with Otoishi?

Yes. Akira Otoishi hid the fact
that he had shot two rats.

Let me confirm.

It was two, and not three or four?

Yes, there's no doubt about it.

Good grief, Akira Otoishi...

Way to go.

It kills everything in its territory,

whether they are humans or its own kind.

It only cares about itself.

It's not a creature that should be
allowed to live on this Earth anymore.

Jotaro, wait!

How are you planning to chase
after a tiny little rat

that's run out into this giant field?

The author of Seton Animal
Chronicles, E.T. Seton, said,

"There is no animal that cannot be tracked."

Rats have a habit of not wanting
to go down an unfamiliar path.

Which means, without a doubt, it went back

toward that irrigation channel.

And if they don't eat constantly,

they will die from starvation
after about ten hours.

There... Those bite marks are new.

Yes! This is awesome!

We'll be able to corner it!

Take a look at this.

It didn't even glance at the bait in the trap.

It's on the video.

Its ear looks like a leaf that's
been eaten on by a bug.

Let's call it "Bug-Eaten" from now on.

Look at how cautious it is...

Unlike earlier,

we can probably bet that
Bug-Eaten won't let us

within 20 meters of him.

These are rifle rounds.

Just in case, I brought four rounds.

A-Actual rounds?!

Because of air resistance,
when round bearings fly

over 20 meters, the point
of impact goes off-course.

With the head of this round,
we'll be okay up to 70 meters.

Am I going to shoot that
with my Stand's hand, too?

I'm not confident about this at all.

Of course not. I guess I'll just have to do it.

Hold on...

Why'd you have to say it like that?

That kind of pissed me off.

I'm the one who took care of the other one!

Sure, it wasn't a perfect shot, but...

Right. So carry two rounds.

Huh?

S-So much pressure...

Be careful. There are leeches in this puddle.

What?!

Impossible...

What's wrong?

Be careful, Josuke.

The footprints suddenly disappear here.

What is this?!

Why'd the footprints disappear?

I know! It's under the dirt.

It must've dug a hole, then covered itself.

No!

This is backtracking...

I didn't think that rats did it, too.

Backtracking?

Backtracking is a special
instinct that wild animals have

in which they go back the way
they came to hide from an enemy.

In Japan, it's said that brown bears,
weasels, and rabbits do this.

But there's no record of
rats backtracking, too.

Does that mean, basically,
that the rat put one over on us?

Things aren't looking good.

With this terrain...

We might actually be the
ones who are being hunted.

I feel like something's staring at us.

We need to hide behind a rock.

Move calmly...

Bug-Eaten's Stand's attack
isn't too fast for us to see.

Don't miss where it's coming from.

If we can find where it's hiding,
we'll shoot it instead.

What the hell is this?!

Wha?!

The rat used the trap that we set for it?

Star Platinum, The World!

Good grief.

Don't panic.

I took out the needle before
the poison spread,

along with the flesh that it pierced.

Put a bandage on it.

And I figured out where the rat's hiding.

Halfway up the hill, near those three rocks.

You're amazing! Both the rat and you, Jotaro!

Am I the only loser this time around?

It's 60 meters away.

It doesn't look like it's going
to shoot more needles yet.

It knows that if it shoots too much,

we'll be able to pinpoint
its location and attack.

Stubborn little bastard.

Why are you complimenting the rat?

We need to do something.

Well said, Josuke.

We need to give it everything we've got,

or Bug-Eaten's gonna get us.

I'll give you all four rounds.

At this distance, it'll go up like a slider,

so aim one centimeter lower than the target.

Jotaro? What are you going to do?

I'm going to get closer
so it'll shoot the needles.

You're going to find out where it is, Josuke...

And then you're going to attack.

Wh-What?!

You're the only one who can do this.

Even if I get hit with one
or two of its needles,

I can have Shining Diamond fix me.

But Josuke, you can't fix yourself.

Give it all you've got, Josuke!

I-I need time to mentally prepare!

Star Platinum, The World!

Did you find it?

N-No... It moved right after it fired!

I'll try to get closer while
going up the side of the hill.

Look for the moment it fires.

The moment it fires...

Th-The pressure!

There! I see it!

What?!

That bastard calculated that I'd dodge

and then fired the needles at the rocks?

It ricocheted?

Jotaro!

Don't look at me, Josuke!

Aim at the rat!

Get it right when it's about to attack!

This isn't good.

I've got four rounds, but I won't
get any more chances.

If I waste any time...

Here we go, Josuke.

There! It's the same spot as before.

But it's hiding behind the rocks.

Damn it! If only it was looking over here...

But I've got to do this!

I'm just going to have
to hit that small target!

I'm suddenly feeling stronger.

I'm going to get you, you little bastard.

Josuke missed...

So you did look.

I thought you'd look if I missed,
and face your body this way.

Now I can target you for sure.

In the end, I wasn't a loser at all.

Call me Josuke Higashikata,
the man who deflects pressure!

The Stand rats that Akira Otoishi created...

Considering the destruction of
nature that humanity brought on,

I'm not sure how to feel...

But thankfully, Josuke's pretty reliable.

Good grief. We can finally relax a little.

Rohan Kishibe's Adventure

Episode 17
Rohan Kishibe's AdventureYou Are Here

Koichi...

Over here, Koichi.

Ah! R-Rohan Kishibe!

Come on, now. You don't have
to put up your guard like that.

It's not like I'm going to harm you.

Besides, when I read you with Heaven's Door,

I actually felt a lot of admiration for you.

I have a feeling we have a lot in common.

Don't you think so?

Uh...

You see, there's something
that I wanted to ask you.

I lived around here from when I was
a baby up until I was about four.

I wanted to find the place where
I lived then, for nostalgia's sake.

It's also a manga artist's job
to remember their childhood.

But the memories would be from
when I was three or four,

so I don't remember much.

Oh...

What I wanted to ask you
about is this town map.

It's quite bizarre.

Look.
Convenience Store
Owson
Kisara
Drugstore
Soba Shop
Arisugawa
Tailor
Tanaka
You Are Here

Soba Shop Arisugawa, Kisara Drugstore,

and the convenience store Owson is how
the shops line up from the right.

Huh?

Now look at the actual shops.

From the right, it's Soba Shop
Arisugawa, Kisara Drugstore, and...

Owson on the left...

Huh?

The road between Owson and
the drugstore isn't on the map.

How lazy of them.

Koichi, will you come with me for a bit?

I'd be very grateful if you'd
show me around here.

Huh? Well, I, uh...

Even after I, Rohan Kishibe,
have asked so courteously?

I see.

So you're not even willing
to walk ten or so meters.

You're so selfish. Jeez...

Just five minutes, okay, Sensei?

Just five minutes!

Episode 17    Rohan Kishibe's Adventure

Isn't it bizarre?

This road isn't on this 1/3000 scale map

of Morioh published by
National Map Publishers.

Huh? Sometimes if you find errors in maps,

they'll give you a bookstore gift certificate.

Ugh...

Jeez, this map is infuriating.

Look, Koichi.

Yonemori

These houses that say "Yonemori," "Honma,"
and "Onodera" aren't on it, either.

Honma

Numakura

Onodera

This map is filled with errors.

Two or three bookstore
gift certificates won't cover this.

Rohan-sensei..

Looks like an empty house.

Rocky

What a strange place.

It doesn't look like anyone lives
in these four or five houses.

Even the electricity to the
vending machine's been cut.

Huh?

That post box...

This is where we first turned.

How strange...

How did we end up back
where we started again?

But we turned right, left,
then right, so how...

It's possible that we're being
attacked by someone's Stand.

Huh? Stand?!

Koichi, would you have
Reverb fly up to the sky?

I see!

If it looks down from above,
we'll see which way to go.

Reverb Act 1!

What's the matter?

Th-There's something there.

Something touched it up in the sky.

I didn't see anything.

But something definitely touched it!

Are you two lost?

Want me to show you the way?

A girl!

That girl's a Stand user!

Heaven's Door!

Don't even give her a chance to speak!

Victory to the swiftest!

Boom

Now we're safe.

She won't be able to harm us.

That's amazing!

I-It looked like a drawing
leaped out just now...

I guess that means I've matured a bit.

Though it wouldn't work
on lame people like Josuke,

who don't like my manga.

We're on the same wavelength.

She's not a Stand user.
She's just a normal girl.

Huh? Sh-She's not an enemy?

Right. You can't hide
anything from Heaven's Door.

She's Reimi Sugimoto, age 16.

Her address is 3-12, Kotodai, Morioh.

It's right over there.

She doesn't have a boyfriend.
Her measurements are 82-57-84 centimeters.

She has a mole on the
side of her left nipple.

She had her first period the
September after she turned 11.

The first time she kissed a boy,
he forced his tongue into her mouth.

Hey! Hold on a sec, Rohan Kishibe!

If that girl's not a Stand user,

then I won't allow you to
read any more about her!

All right, all right.

Don't get so angry.

"She'll forget everything
that just happened." There.

Want me to show you the way?

A lot of people get lost around here,

since all the alleys looks alike.

We'll be fine if you could
just tell us which way to go.

No, no. You won't understand
if I just explain it to you.

I'll show you the way, so follow me.

Want one?

No?

Could you just grab the other end, then?

Snap

Aw, you're going to get dumped by some girl.

What are you talking about?

It's Pocky fortune-telling. How the
Pocky breaks tells me your fortune.

You're selfish, aren't you?

And you have a tendency to mess with people.

That's why you'll get dumped.

Did you hear that, Koichi?
She's completely off!

She called me selfish!

If we're going to play that game,
I know a thing or two, as well.

Light pink nail polish means you're
a coward when it comes to love.

You let true love slip away
at the crucial moment.

Huh?

No way...

This is a psychological test,
not fortune-telling.

Other than love, there's something else
scaring you right now, isn't there?

Apparently,

a murder took place at this
house about fifteen years ago.

A murder?!

Murder...

No one lives there now.

Do you want to hear about it?

I heard this from the old
lady who lives next door.

The night of the murder,

while the girl who lived here
was asleep in her bedroom,

she awoke to a "drip, drip" sound
coming from her parents' room.

She wondered what the sound was,
and called out to her parents,

but there was no reply.

But the girl wasn't that scared, because...

Her beloved dog was by her side.

Beloved dog?

Yes. He was a big guard dog.

Even in the dark, if she put
her hand underneath her bed,

he would whimper and lick her hand.

She felt safe because Arnold was with her.

But she heard the dripping sound
go on for more than ten minutes...

Finally, the girl decided to
find out what the sound was.

And then...

She found her beloved dog Arnold dead,

hanging from the coat rack.

His blood was the dripping
sound that she heard.

Suddenly, she heard a voice
from under the bed say,

"Your hand is so soft and cute,
Miss. Whimper, whimper..."

"I already killed your parents." And then...

The girl was killed, too!

I-Is that a true story?!

Did it sound like one? It was just
payback for trashing my nail polish.

Whew...

Th-That stuff is bad for my heart... Jeez...

Drip

Wha—

That's...

Yes... That girl was me.

Both Arnold and I are ghosts.

G-Ghosts?

What my Stand, Heaven's Door, read

were memories from when she
was alive, so I couldn't tell.

You two walked into the place
where I died fifteen years ago.

I guess we're on the same wavelength.

This is the border between
the living world and the next.

Let's get out of here, Koichi!

Use Reverb, Koichi!

Have it fly into the air and find the way!

She must have been what
touched it in the sky earlier.

Just have it fly up already, Koichi!

Wha—

What?! There's suddenly a wall in the sky!

K-Koichi, Reverb is touching the ground.

Huh?! Ah, what?!

Y-You're the one who went
flying up into the air.

There's only one way out of this place.

And I know where it is.

H-How are we supposed to fight a ghost?

Please don't possess us!

Hey, hold on. Stop treating
me like a vengeful spirit.

What did I do to you?

You're the ones getting all scared on your own!

I'm not the one who trapped you in here.

This is the border between
this world and the next.

You two have strange powers.

They're called Stands?

I wonder if that's how you ended up here.

You're not our enemy?

You really don't trust people, do you?

I think I'm what they call a bound spirit?

I became a ghost that can't leave here.

For fifteen years, I tried to speak to
various people who ended up here,

because I needed to tell someone.

But you're the first ones that
I've been able to talk to this much.

I told you I'd tell you how to get out of
here, and that's what I'm going to do.

After I finish the story, that is.

Story?

The rest of my story from earlier.

Before I could see the murderer's face,

I was stabbed in the back with a knife.

It was late at night and dark,

and I was desperately running away.

The murderer hasn't been caught yet.

He's somewhere in Morioh.

That's what I wanted to tell someone.

He's blended into this town.

Wait. Are you telling us because...

I'm not asking you to catch him.

But I want you to tell someone...

Someone who can catch him, like the police...

Whoa, whoa. Why should we have
to do something like that?

Rohan-sensei!

It's fine. I just want to say the rational thing.

I do feel bad that you were killed...

But why should we have to find
the murderer just because of

your personal grudge and suffering?

I think, as a ghost, you'd be better off

cutting your ties to this world
and passing on into the next.

Do you even know how many boys and
girls have disappeared from this town?

Huh? No.

It's eight times the national average.

I'm not saying it's all of them, but at least
some of them are being killed in secret.

By him.

W-Wait a second!

Are you saying these murders
are still happening?

Hey! Don't make baseless claims like that!

You just said you didn't
see the murderer's face!

So how would you know that?

The souls of the murdered
fly above here all the time!

And they all have a wound just like this.

H-How cruel... It's so long and deep...

I can't talk to those souls
going to the next world,

but I've seen them many times.

I know what he's into! I know!

These murders have been going on for

fifteen years here in Morioh,
where I was born and raised.

It's frightening, and it wounds my pride.

When they catch the murderer,
my beloved Morioh

will be known nationwide as a
town where a murderer lived.

But we have to stop the
murderer as soon as possible!

Even now, he's targeting someone,
and I can't do a thing.

Who's going to be killed next?

If you, the living, don't take
back this town's pride and peace,

who else is going to do it?!

I don't know if you understand
what I'm saying, but...

I'm done talking now.

A-All right. I'm very shocked.

But... Still, we have to do something.

Hmph. Stop being such a
goody-two-shoes, Koichi.

It's just going to be trouble.

But it might be good to go after
the murderer and interview him.

I might be able to draw a
really interesting manga!

Is the exit this way?

If you think he's a good person
deep down... well, you shouldn't.

He's pretty gray when it
comes to being trustworthy.

Hey, are you listening?

All right. I'll lead you to the exit.

Huh? The exit? Where? Where is it?

If you turn left past the
post box, it's right there.

Yay!

Don't rush!

There's a certain rule you have
to follow to get past there.

A rule?

Once you pass the post box and turn,

you'll be able to see the
exit about 20 meters away.

No matter what happens,

until you get there, promise
me that you won't turn around.

What? Why?

It's the rule for passing
from this world to the next.

Even Arnold understands that.

Well, I guess we can promise to do
something even a dog can handle.

What happens if we turn around?

Our souls will be pulled into the
next world, which means you'll die.

Don't be frightened!

Just don't turn around. Simple, right?

R-Right when we passed the post box...

Something shot between our
legs and went behind us!

Don't turn around!

Just keep walking slowly and calmly.

R-Rohan-sensei, something is following us.

I know.

Something's there...

Something is right behind my head!

Don't worry about it!

There's always something trying
to make you turn around.

But as long as you don't
turn and look at it,

it can't touch you, so just
keep your wits about you.

N-Now a warm liquid is dripping down my neck...

You're almost there! That light is the exit.

What?
Huh?

Th-The exit...

But I can't take it any longer!

Rohan-sensei, let's run!

Don't panic!

It's going to try to trip you.

You're safe now.

You got through it.

You can turn around from there.

That was so scary! I'm so relieved!

That was a lie, Koichi!

That wasn't really me just now!

Huh?

Impossible...

Not yet. Don't look back yet.

This didn't happen when I was by myself.

They didn't try to trick me!

Koichi!

Hmph. I don't really get it,
but we just can't look, right?

You're lucky you're with me, Koichi.

Heaven's Door!

You won't be able to see,
and you'll be blown away.

Crash

Boom

Calm down, Koichi.

I'll write that you can see again now.

The road between the convenience
store and drugstore is gone.

W-We made it back...

We'll always be here.

Until the murderer's caught.

The day that Arnold and I turn around to go

where my mom and dad are will be

when the pride and peace
of this town are restored.

Until then, I can't leave here.

If you ever need to ask me anything,

come by any time.

We can see each other any time,

Rohannie and Koichi...

I thank you from the bottom of my heart

for listening to what I had to say.

That girl had some nerve, calling me "Rohannie."

She was getting too friendly.

But... Reimi Sugimoto, huh...

There's something admirable
about how that ghost lives.

She's been fighting for fifteen years,
alone, for the sake of the living.

There it is! Sugimoto Reimi, age 16.

Not that I doubted her,
but now I've got some clues.

Ah, could you be...

Rohan Kishibe, who became a manga artist?

You know me?

Rohan, you were only four,

so it's no surprise that you
don't remember that incident.

Your house at the time was very near theirs.

The night of that incident,
your parents had urgent business

they had to attend to and
were forced to leave...

So they left you overnight
at the Sugimoto household

because you were all very close.

That night, Rohan, you were staying
overnight at the Sugimoto household.

And you were the only one to survive.

I was... there?

Sugimoto

When the police found you,

you kept crying and repeating
the same thing over and over.

"Reimi snuck me out the window."

Reimi saved you before you
could be found by the murderer.

That little girl... No wonder
she acted all friendly with me.

I can't read my distant memories nor
my fate with my Stand, Heaven's Door.

If you happen to wander down this path,

do not turn around, no matter what.

Meet a Girl's Ghost"
How to get there: Take the #11 bus

It will appear between the
convenience store, Owson,
and Kisara Drugstore at 2-chome.
Warning: Most people won't be
able to see it, but if you happen
to wander down this path, do not
turn around, no matter what.

I really met a ghost!

The girl in that picture is Reimi!

Okay, we get it.

So, I researched her,
I said I believe you, didn't I? Right, Okuyasu?

and she was also a student
at Budogaoka High School.

She's cute... She's my type.

I wish I'd been born fifteen years sooner.

We should eventually go meet this ghost, too.

But, Koichi, if we tell Jotaro
or Old Man Joseph about this,

they're probably going to ask one thing.

"Is the murderer a Stand user?"

W-Well... I don't know...

Then we'll just have to let the
police and the courts deal with it.

B-But there's a murderer in Morioh!

I know. And that's why I'm saying that
Jotaro and the Speedwagon Foundation

won't just go after a normal murderer.

Calm down.

He's managed to escape from the
almighty police for the past fifteen years.

It's not like we'd run into him right away,
like we'd hailed a taxi cab.

Let's stay calm and look into this carefully.

So what did Rohan have to say?

The same thing as you, Josuke.

Hey, look out, Koichi.

Don't cross the road when
you're all spaced out.

S-Sorry...

Originally, Morioh was a resort filled
with villas that belonged to samurai.

My ancestors were among them.

But we were ruined during
my grandfather's time.

All that's left is the house that I live in now.

And I'm stuck working a trivial office job.

Hey, what did you do with the
imported wristwatch I bought you?

Ah, it's in your bag. That's right.

It was a little too big for you.

Let's get it fixed tomorrow.

What's wrong? Why are you acting so shy?

Now... Watch your step.

Let's enjoy this weekend to the fullest.

Just the two of us.

You just dripped something...

How rude you are.

You need to clean that up yourself.

I can't remember what your name was,
but that's all right.

Well done. You cleaned it all off.

Now, then...

Let's make dinner together.

What's the dish that you're best at?

Shigechi's Harvest, Part 1Just like a sickness that continues to
progress without any visible symptoms,

there was someone hiding
in our town of Morioh,

committing murders somewhere in the town.

And it seems like no one's even realized
that these murders are taking place.

It's such shocking and chilling information.

But there is currently no
way of finding that murderer.

We don't even know how many Stand
users currently live in Morioh.

And rather than worry about a huge problem
that presents no visible symptoms,

people are worried about what
they should have for dinner,

because that's what's right in front of us.

I only have 285 yen left in my savings!

Twelve yen?!

My 20,000 yen that I was saving up to
buy those kewl brand-name shoes...

I can't even remember what I used the money on.

This is all that damn old man's fault!

Because he used my card to buy
130,000 yen worth of baby crap!

I made the old man pay me
back the 130,000 later,

but then I felt like spending a little

here and there wouldn't hurt,
and totally lost track of my spending.

I wonder if I tucked away a thousand yen
somewhere and just forgot about it.

A cockroach!

I guess banks could have them, too.

A S-Stand?

I found one yen.

Y-You bastard!

I-It's a Stand!

A new Stand has appeared!

Episode 18    Shigechi's Harvest, Part 1

Where the hell is it heading?

There's another one!

Damn it! Who the hell are you?!

I'll kill you!

Okuyasu!

Oh, Josuke!

Look! It's an enemy Stand. I'm gonna kill it!

There're two of them!

Yeah. There was one at the
bank, so I followed it here.

How did it attack you?

Actually, it didn't attack me.

I was buying Calpis Water,

and it suddenly came out from
under the vending machine.

What? It didn't attack you?

But you just said you were going to kill it.

It scared the crap out of me,

and I spilled the Calpis Water
all over my uniform.

Damn it! Give me back my money!

Found it!

Hey, another one just joined in...

Found it!

Found it. Found it.

What the... What the hell are these guys?

There's a ton of them gathering up!

Okuyasu, they're just like
your brother Keicho's Stand.

But...

Since they're ignoring us, they're
a totally different kind of creepy.

Yeah...

Be careful! The user's probably nearby.

Boom

It's...

It's money!

Come to think of it, it picked up a 1 yen coin

underneath a machine at the bank.

They're only 1 yen and 10 yen
coins, but they're all real!

Well done, you guys.

Many a little makes a mickle.

I think that's about five thousand yen.

As long as I have you guys, Harvest,

I'll never have to worry about money.

Hey, that's the user?

He's talking to his Stand...

Yeah... He seems to have
become a Stand user because

of the bow and arrow, but it doesn't
look like he's trying to attack us.

Grin!

You guys...

You can see my Harvest?

Hey, you can see them, right?!

Yeah, it's called a Stand.

I'm Josuke Higashikata.

This is Okuyasu Nijimura.

Friends! I've never had any before!

My name is Shigekiyo Yangu.

I'm a second-year at Budogaoka Middle School.

I weigh 110 kilograms,

and my Papa and Mama call me "Shigechi."

"Shige-chan" turned into "Shigechi."

My turtle I have at home is named Gonta.

The other day, I was wondering
if the 41 yen, 62 yen,

and 150 yen stamps all tasted different,

so I was licking them all,
and Mama yelled at me.

This is a picture of my Mama,
who yelled at me.

A picture...

Wow, your mom's actually kinda hot.

How strange.

U-Um...

So, you call these things "Harvest"?

Did they really gather up all this?

Yup. From ditches and underneath
vending machines and things...

But I'm not a thief.

The officer at the police box said that

I didn't have to turn in any
change under a hundred yen.

I hate bad things!

That's not a bad thing at all!

Actually, I think you're doing
something great for society.

Though it's not much,

you're putting all of the forgotten
change back into the Japanese economy.

That's a great thing.

Really? I'm great?

Hey, do you think I'm a great person?

It's what you'd call a blind spot for ideas.

No one would do all this to get money.

I'm jealous... You're smart.

D-Did you just call me smart?

N-No one's ever told me that before.

I've picked up about 120,000 yen, but...

120,000?!

B-But that makes me even happier!

A t-total of 120,000?!

Aren't I a good boy?

J-Just here in Morioh?

Ayup! I don't go outside of Morioh.

I might get lost and someone might kidnap me.

120,000... And I only have 12 yen.

Okuyasu...

Is something wrong with your left foot?

Whoa, what?!

There are three 50 yen coins on the ground!

Do they belong to you, Shigekiyo?

I didn't even notice...

Talk about stingy...

Hey, I'll give you guys half of this.

Huh?!

You're my friends, right?
We have the same kind of power.

R-Really?!

Lucky us!

N-No... Wait a sec.

Look, you shouldn't give other
people money or things so easily.

Then I'll give it to you in a hard way.

I'll give it all to you. We're friends, right?

Hey, why are you just
hardening your expression?

H-Hey...

Let me talk to him alone for a sec, Shigechi.

Hey, Josuke! Stop acting
like a goody-two-shoes.

If he says he's going to give it to us,
we should just take it, dumbass!

My pride won't let me do that. Not Josuke.

I'll take anything anyone wants to
give me other than a virus! Got it?!

Calm down! I totally understand
what you're saying!

Stop crying!

But...

I'm actually really broke right now, too.

And so I just thought of a nice idea
that can make everyone happy.

Huh? An idea to make everyone happy?

Leave it to me.

Hey, Shigekiyo. Can I call you "Shigechi"?

Sure.

Shigechi, we can't take this.

What you tried to do just now

is the same as trying to
buy friendship with money.

Huh? B-But that's not what I meant!

I believe that friendship is

something that grows between
people through a common bond.

I was just...

I know. I totally get how you feel.

We're all Stand user buddies.

And so...

Why don't we do a little business
and strike up a friendship?

Business?

Yeah. A business using all three of our powers.

Right here?

That's your elbow. No, business.

Basically, I think you're at your
limit for picking up lost change.

So I have an idea for how
we can use your Harvest

to make even more money.

Huh?

An idea that'll make us more money
than Harvest picking up change?

It's not a bad thing, and it
won't cause anyone trouble.

S-So what's the idea?

That's where the business comes in!

Give Okuyasu and me half of
what we make for the idea fee.

You'll take the other half, Shigechi.

The three of us are going to work
together to pull off a huge project,

and we can all become happy.

O-Okay! That's fine, but wh-what should I do?

You know what this is, right?

Kame Yu

A b-blue stamp!

Yeah! When you shop at one of Eastern
Japan's biggest department store chains,

Kame Yu, you get one sticker
for every 100 yen you spend.

I think there are a lot of people who

don't collect these and just throw them away.

There are these, too.

I know what you're thinking!

Let's go, you guys!

With only one or two,
they'd just be scraps of paper...

But if Harvest happened to pick up

that are thrown away around town...

Found it. Found it.

Found it.

Found it. Found it. Found it.

Found it. Found it. Found it.

Th-They just keep piling up one after another!

Wh-What an amazing Stand!
That's awesome, Shigechi!

I got complimented again.

We'll fix the ripped pieces of
paper with Shining Diamond.

Yes! Do we have tens of thousands now?

No, it's definitely over 100,000 by now.

Yes!

Grab

We're an invincible trio!

Let's go get our money!

But, Josuke, you sure are something.

After you went on about pride and junk...

Well, in this case,
everyone's happy, so it's fine.

F-Friendship is great...

O-Okuyasu, J-Josuke, I wonder if it'll be okay.

Will it turn into money that easily?

Calm down, Shigechi. Believe in Josuke.

That's Okuyasu and...

I wonder who that is.

Okuyasu—

Josuke! H-How did it go?

Were you able to get the money?

Did they tell you to piss off?

I wasn't able to get cash back
at the CD shop or the toy store.

But I can exchange the coupons for about
40,000 yen worth of CDs or video games.

I'm not asking about that!

What about Kame Yu?

Were you able to get cash
back for the Kame Yu stickers?

Actually, something kind of
unexpected happened.

S-Something unexpected?

It unexpectedly turned into 61,500 yen!

Here you go! It's real, Shigechi!

I-It's real!

It's right in front of my eyes! It's like a dream!

That's awesome, Shigechi!

Your Stand, Harvest, is really amazing!

Y-You really think it's amazing?

Hey... P-People don't really
compliment me much...

Do you really think I'm amazing?

Hey, have a little more confidence, Shigechi.

This is something that only you can do.

Okuyasu... Josuke...

Straighten.

Hey, girl. I got a fat stack!
Wanna go have some fun?

Hey, hey, hey, hey!

Oh, yeah. Here, Josuke, Okuyasu.
Here's your share, 10,000 yen.

Shigechi, what is this?

We've got friendship, right?
We're friends, right?

Yeah, we are.

So that's a token of our friendship.

Hey, wait...

This isn't what we promised, is it?

You said okay to us getting half,
and you getting the other.

Half of 61,500 yen is 30,750 exactly.

R-Really? Did I say that?

What?

N-N-Not to mention...

It w-was my H-Harvest's job
to collect all of those.

I did it all!

Y-You two were just talking and did nothing.

And, if Josuke hadn't come up with the idea,

you never would have thought
of gathering up all those!

I would have eventually thought of it!

I'm an awesome guy!

Er... No, no... You never would have
thought of it with that pea brain of yours!

Hey, stop, Okuyasu.
Come here, fall back a sec.

This is just great.

Apparently he was fine with a few thousand,

but once it went over ten thousand,
he's much more hesitant to pay up.

I don't think he means anything bad by it,
but since he's got the mind of a kid,

no matter what we say,
he's gonna feel like we tricked him.

We should be the adults here and let it be.

We got 10,000 yen out of it,
so let's call that good.

I guess if you're okay with it, I won't argue...

But this just pisses me off so much!

Are you sure he's not taking advantage of us?

No, Okuyasu, there's no point
in fighting right now.

We just need to teach Shigechi how
adults actually make agreements.

Oh, so you can make more money?

You smug bastard...

But that's what I love about you.

All right, thanks. We'll gladly take this.

Okuyasu.

Are you thirsty?

Is there anything you want to drink? I'll buy.

You're going to buy it for me?

Then... I want some Calpis Water.

Then drink some.

Ah! Hey! Why are you throwing those away?

They're just worthless junk tickets,
like for the year-end lottery.

I told Shigechi to pick them up along
with everything else earlier.

You mean the losing New Year's Lottery tickets?

How do you know it's a losing ticket?

No one would throw away a
winning ticket, dumbass.

There are lots of people who forget

to confirm the numbers and
never get their prizes!

If this wins, I'm gonna take half of it.

Promise me, damn it.

Sure. Half is fine.

But if you win a sheet of stamps, I don't want it.

And you should only worry about that

Good luck with that.

Hey, what are you yelling for?

Prize    5 Million Yen

5 Million Yen

5,000,000!

There's no doubt about it! I won!

What?! You better not be
messing around, damn it!

5 Million Yen

Yes! It's a dream come true! A fantasy!

There's no other experience like this!

Wait, wait, wait, wait!

Calm down, Okuyasu.

Let's confirm it one more time.

SG Group 121314, prize 5,000,000 yen.

There's no doubt about it!

It's too good to be true, but it's true!

And it's a lottery ticket
that was thrown away,

so it would've just gone
into the incinerator.

There's still a few days before it expires.

Even if they ask us annoying questions
when we go to cash it at the bank,

we can just proudly say that we bought it!

You got that?

Heck yeah, I do!

Which means it's our 5,000,000 yen!

I wonder what I should buy.

First, I gotta get some kewl Italian shoes!

Then I'll buy a high-end
suit with a sexy silhouette,

and go all-out at Tonio's shop
and eat the most expensive food!

I also want to go overseas somewhere!

I'm gonna put it in savings!

Man, talk about a boring life!

M-My Harvest is the one that picked that up...

Five million... Th-There's no
way I'm giving up half of it.

Episode 19    Shigechi's Harvest, Part 2

Now, I do have one question...

Reception Office

From which vendor did you
gentlemen purchase this ticket?

Sniff, sniff.

Wh-Which?

Wh-Why do you want to know that?

Oh, it's just a formality.

You stupid little brats.

You won five million yen? That's too fishy.

I'm a very capable bank associate,
and I smell something rotten here.

Or perhaps

there's a reason you'd rather
not answer that question?

W-Well, of course we bought it in Morioh.

Oh? Well, that's bizarre...

There isn't a single lottery vendor in Morioh.

O-Oh, right...

It must have been when we went to S City.

We bought all kinds of things,
so I don't remember that well...

I-I-I-I-I-It was a while back, too...

I just realized something bizarre...

On the other side of the lottery ticket,

there's a place to write your name
and telephone number, and...

Ichiro Morishita

Ichiro Morishita...

The name written here doesn't
match any of your names.

N-Name?!

Phone number?!

That was written on the back?!

E-Er...

Well, well, well, well, this is truly bizarre.

This is your lottery ticket, isn't it?

Oh, yeah! Now I remember!

I wrote down my friend's number
on that instead of a memo pad!

Oh! Is that so?

Then how about we give
Mr. Ichiro Morishita a call?

We can also tell where

lottery tickets are purchased
with the serial number here.

If Mr. Ichiro Morishita was the
one who purchased this ticket

and remembers exactly where he bought it,

we'll then have to check this signature, too...

To see who this ticket belongs to.

Depending on the situation, we may
have to turn it over to the police.

The police?!

Hello? This is Morishita.

Hello, I'm calling on behalf of Budogaoka Bank.

I wanted to inquire if Mr. Ichiro Morishita

had purchased the Great
Year-End Lottery ticket.

Oh, I'm Ichiro Morishita,
and yes, I bought one.

Yeah, I'm sure I bought one.

Yes! You stupid little brats!

My sense of smell was correct!

There's no way God would grant
brats like you the winning ticket!

Morishita

So you did! You bought a lottery ticket.

Yeah, I did.

Morishita Ichiro

But I bought like, ten, and
none of them were winners.

I'm going to change just part of the signature...

Kinoshita Ichiro

You see, Mr. Kinoshita, your lottery ticket...

Kinoshita? My name's Morishita.

Huh? But it said "Mori"!
What? How strange...

Your phone number is 1771-1281,
correct, Mr. Kinoshita?

I told you my name's not
Kinoshita, you dumbass!

It's Morishita!

Why are you wasting my time with this?

I threw them all away.

Why don't you sell some
winning tickets sometime?

P-Pardon me...

J-Just wait, you!

The number you are trying to
reach is currently not in use.

Please confirm the number and try again...

A-Are you satisfied?

I-I-I'm terribly sorry for my rudeness.

Yay! It's my money!

I won this five million yen!

Hey, you promised that half
of it would be ours, Shigechi!

Did I say that?

You're doing that again?!

Hey, Josuke! Why are you stopping me?!

You're not gonna let him get
away with it again, are you?

No... This time, I'm not backing down, either!

There's no way you're getting away with this!

Well said, Josuke!

Of course you wouldn't back down!

It's only logical!

So now you don't want to
split the money, Shigechi?

You realize this amount is way too
much for that to fly, don't you?

Here.

This should be enough for you guys.

You didn't really do anything, after all.

I'll take pity on you
because you're my friends.

Crush

Why, you—

Hey, Okuyasu!

Give us the money, you dumbass!

You promised us half,
so you're going to give us half!

Stop being greedy, you idiot!

You're always so quick to hit. Don't be rash.

When dumbasses don't get what you're saying,
this is how you make them understand!

Are you hurt?

I'm sorry Okuyasu suddenly hit you.

But, Shigechi, let's not cause any trouble.

We're gonna hold onto the promissory
note for the five million.

In three days, when it becomes cash,

let's split it evenly in half, like we discussed.

But, man, he's ridiculous.

I'm done hanging out with him.

But you know,

I think we should reflect on the fact
that we thought about using him

to get some pocket money, too.

You dummy.

Huh?

I'm not gonna think of it like that.

The only reason he was able to get
the five million was because of us.

If it was him alone, he could only
get maybe tens of thousands.

But he's getting 2.5 million on his own.

2.5 million!

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

yes, yes, yes, yes!

Like I'll give it to you.

Like I'll give it to you!

I heard everything, damn it!

I won't give you guys even one yen!

We got that five million
because of my Harvest!

You're no match for my Harvest!

You wanna see proof?

You want to see some solid proof?

I'll show you!

Ow!

Bastard!

No! The promissory note for the five million!

You're underestimating us, you little punk!

If you keep chasing me,

I'll kill you.

Shigechi...

You're gonna kill us, you backstabbing bastard?

You'd better be prepared to die if you're
gonna bring out your Stand against us!

W-Wait, Josuke...

What's wrong?

What's this sensation?

M-My legs...

are itching really bad.

Itching? At a time like this?

They itch really bad!

My whole body itches!

Wh-What is this?!

Lift up your pants, Okuyasu! Hurry!

What?!

They're inside my pants!

I-It's no use!

Knocking off two or three of
them won't damage him at all!

Damn it!

He's running away!

I-I'm starting to get really pissed off.

I've already been super pissed off!

We're not letting you get away, five million!

Now he's totally made enemies
of the Okuyasu-Josuke duo!

Damn it! How dare he make a
fool of the great Okuyasu?!

I'm gonna beat him to death!

He must be really dumb to be greedy enough

to take the whole five million.

You stupid fatty!

You think you can run with a body like that?!

See? That's what you get, moron!

H-He keeps summoning Harvests under
him like a caterpillar track,

or like a bucket relay!

What the hell? He's ridiculously fast!

He may be a simpleton, but he's pretty clever.

Are they like his natural instincts?

Crap! We're gonna lose him!

Calm down.

We just need to

have our Stands lift our bodies in
the same way he is, and climb up!

I get it!

My five million...

You actually think you can
get away from us, Shigechi?

Bring it on!

I'll carefully pop your Harvests, one by one!

My Harvest is amazing.

It'll gather anything!

Even screws holding pipes together.

Even bolts!

If you want to talk about amazing,
there's also my Shining Diamond!

Heya.

I'm still super pissed off, but right now,
I'm still willing to forgive you.

I'll just hit you two or three times!

Come on, give us the promissory note
for the five million, Shigechi.

I told you...

If you came after me,

I'd kill you.

Wh-What?

My hands...

That hurt...

I can't stand! Okuyasu, be careful!

He did something to me!

O-Okuyasu, you too?

You still haven't figured it out?

You guys are drunk!

A-Alcohol?!

Liquor

My harvest gathers anything!

It brought some alcohol
from the liquor store earlier,

then injected it into your bodies!

Right into your veins!

Wh-What?!

You bastard!

When you inject alcohol into your veins,

even a tiny amount will get you really drunk!

C-Come to think of it,

I've heard that alcohol is in the
same group as anesthetics...

Th-That bastard... m-might be pretty smart...

Or it might be his natural instincts.

I-I'm gonna murder him!

There's no way we're gonna lose
just because we're drunk!

M-My eye!

Josuke, hurry and fix it!

W-Wait, Okuyasu!

You guys had the nerve to

call me unreasonable and other
things earlier, didn't you?

I'll show you what happens
when you underestimate me!

D-Damn it!

You have the nerve to get cocky after
you're the one who broke your promise?

I'm seriously going to get pissed off!

There's no telling what I'll do then!

Shut your stupid mouth, Josuke!

Your Stands' powers are nothing!

You guys are useless!

Make demands once you have
even half of Harvest's power!

Josuke, close your eyes!

Josuke!

Damn, so close!

But it's no use closing your eyes.

Harvest can get anything!

It can rip off your eyelids
and pry out your eyeballs!

All right, Shigechi, stop!

Forgive us already! It was all our fault.

Oh? You're apologizing?

Damn it, you little punk!

Oh? Okuyasu, it doesn't seem
like Josuke feels that way.

I-I'll give him a talking-to!

Just let us off the hook with this!

This is the 10,000 yen you gave
me and the rest of my money.

Let us off the hook with this.

Who's going to fix my eye if Josuke gets killed?

O-Okuyasu...

Oh, yeah! I just remembered!

I felt really bad for you guys,
and gave you more than 10,000 yen!

Here, take this, and please forgive us.

I get it, Okuyasu!

Just like baiting a tanuki
with food and catching it,

you're trying to lure him
over with cash to defeat him!

I totally got what you're thinking!

Okuyasu, being honest like that
is very favorable with me.

There, there.

Hey, wait a sec.

Okuyasu, you aren't trying
to trick me by luring me

closer with money so you can attack
me with your Stand, are you?

Ah! So you are!

Did you really think I'd fall for that?

You really thought I was that stupid?

I won't forgive you anymore!

That's fine, if you don't forgive us.

But it's too late.

Don't you realize that you're
already in The Hand's range?

I'm going to scrape away space

and make it

teleport!

We got it back.

Got it back?

Wh-What are you talking about?

I'll just easily take it back...

You don't seem to realize, Shigechi,

that you have no chance of winning now.

The five million!

What are you doing?!

Inconceivable! Inconceivable!

Stop!

Why would you do that?!

Inconceivable! Inconceivable!
Inconceivable! Inconceivable!

That's five million yen!

Basically, just try and injure or kill us.

The only one that can fix this
note is my Shining Diamond...

So there's no way you can win.

Oh... I-I see! Conceivable!

And what happens next certifies your loss.

H-Huh? Again, inconceivable! Inconceivable!
Inconceivable! Inconceivable!

What are you doing?!

Pick them all up, Harvest!

Looks like you don't realize that

the fact that you're having
Harvest go pick them up

means that you've lost.

So now who's going to protect you
from these two drunks right here?

Oh, conceivable...

Smash

We did it.

Now, Shigechi...

Why don't we review something very simple?

The one that collects all
the pieces is your Harvest,

and whose Stand is the one that
will put them back together?

Hm?

Who is it?

Who's going to fix it with
their Shining Diamond?

J-Josuke...

Whack
Whack
Josuke? Did you just address me so casually?

M-Mr. Josuke!

That's right, it's Mr. Josuke.

But who was the one who just took
back the promissory note from you?

Say his name.

O-Okuyasu...

Mr. Okuyasu!

Well done. That's a good boy.

All right, next, let's do a little calculation.

How should we split the five million?

How would we split it so
that no one feels slighted?

H-Half is fine...

In half?

You realize now that there are
three of us here, don't you?

So isn't half a bit off?

That doesn't really add up at all.

Hello?

I-It'd be a third...

Th-That's right...

If it was just me, I'd only be able to gather.

I-I was wrong.

We all found this lottery ticket.

We wouldn't have gotten it
without the three of us.

I...

I realize that now. I was blinded by greed.

Let's split it up evenly,
so no one is slighted.

Bam

Yes!

B-Bills!

I-It's five million yen!

Please consider depositing it into our
Budogaoka Bank for peace of mind.

Of course!

We finally did it! It's like a dream!

Wait... Splitting it up evenly
so no one is slighted, huh?

Huh? This is weird.

If we're going to split it up evenly,

isn't it unfair if we don't include
the number of Stands we have?

If we consider that my Stand,
Harvest, is about 500,

then we should split it 500 to 1 and 1.

Don't you think so?

You little bastard!

You're seriously going to
argue about this again?

It's never going to end, you dumbass!

O-One third is fine!

Episode 20
Yukako Yamagishi Dreams of CinderellaYukako Yamagishi has been depressed lately.

What? There's someone you like?

Yeah! We both like each other!

I went to the Angelo Stone the other day and

there were a lot of tourists taking pictures.

Wow, it's that famous now, huh?

What's wrong, Koichi?

If I can just keep Koichi in my heart,
that's all I need to be happy.

I thought that once, but it's really hard...

I wish he'd look at me, even just a little.

But I just don't know what
I'm supposed to do...

"My makeup will
help you encounter love"

Cinderella?

How lucky can I be?

I can't believe such a wonderful
guy proposed to me!

Thank you, Dr. Aya! Thank you so much!

Phew...

I guess a woman's youth is better spent

happy and ugly than dark and beautiful...

Come in.

"My makeup will help you encounter love."

What's written on that sign is true.

If you're interested...

Welcome to Salon Cinderella.

Episode 20    Yukako Yamagishi Dreams of Cinderella

Please, come in.

My name is Aya Tsuji.

Phew... I'm the owner of
this place and an aesthetician.

I talk like I have low blood pressure,
but don't let it bother you.

Phew...

But I'm very motivated by my work.

Phew...

You...

are quite beautiful.

Phew...

I had no idea there was
someone so beautiful in Morioh...

Now, please have a seat right over there.

Write your name and address on that form.

I haven't decided that I'll do this yet.

Here's the price listing.

Makeup Menu
Makeup to Encounter Love... 1000 yen
Makeup to Capture Love... 1500 yen
Makeup to Get Proposed to... 2000 yen
Makeup to Make Men Submit... 3000 yen
Makeup to Marry into Wealth... 5000 yen
Makeup to Marry a Celebrity... 7000 yen
Facial Menu

"Makeup to marry a celebrity"?

This salon is a bit different
from ordinary salons.

I'm an aesthetician who
creates faces of happiness.

Physiognomy—that is, the shape of one's face—

High Brows

Double
Eyelid

Big, Wide Eyes

can change someone's fortune.

If you have a face that will be loved,

it'll heighten your luck
with encountering love.

Hmm... Too bad.

The shapes of your eyes and
eyebrows aren't good.

Phew...

I'm going to be blunt.

This is so stupid that
I'm beyond disappointed.

You're trying to charge money for this?

With that face, the more you love a boy,
the more he's going to run away.

Am I wrong?

Have you not experienced that?

You're wrong.

I've never had that happen in my life.

Oh, no? Very well, then.

In your case...

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm not very accustomed to working with CG.

This is the face that will encounter love.

Wait... This is cosmetic surgery.

You do surgeries?

This is a face we'll create using
only makeup and beauty massage.

But it only lasts thirty minutes.

If you don't encounter love,

I will return the thousand-yen fee to you.

Would you like to try it?

All right. If it's just makeup...

I have nothing to lose,
so I guess I can give it a try.

Thank you. Let's get started, then.

Close your eyes.

Make sure you don't open your eyes.

Don't move.

My hands may slip if you do.

Koichi...

This is the makeup that'll
help me encounter love?

Will my luck really change just by altering

the lines of my eyes and eyebrows?

Koichi?

I-I've been looking for you, Yukako.

Huh? Me?

Yeah... You passed by Rengatei
earlier, didn't you?

You looked really sad back there,

a-and I sort of got worried...

Worried?

You were worried about me, Koichi?

Y-Yeah... A lot happened between us,
but it doesn't bug me anymore,

so I don't want you to feel down about it.

R-Really?

Yeah...

I can't believe it...

Is this really because of the makeup?

K-Koichi...

Rather than standing around,

why don't we find a place to sit and chat?

Huh?

U-Um... Only if you want to...

Well...

I guess I am a little thirsty...

Huh? Huh?!

I really am lucky.

Things are really changing!

I get to be near the cute, yet strong, Koichi...

I suddenly want to eat a chocolate parfait.

Does that make me seem girly?

Huh? No! Not at all!

That's what I wanted, too!

This is like a dream...

Physiognomy really does exist!

I'm really on a roll right now.

My luck is really on a roll right now!

I... I can't believe it...

I can feel Koichi-kun's
warmth and beating heart.

I'm so happy...

This is the happiest I've ever been.

Oh, It's 4 PM! I can't believe it's this late!

H-Huh?!

M-My stomach hurts!

Ow...

Y-Yukako, I'm sorry!

I'm gonna head home.

K-Koichi!

Why...

Why is it only thirty minutes?!

Hey, lady! Can't you see the light's red?

Shut up!

It's the light's fault for turning red!

Why is it only for thirty minutes?!

Make it longer!

You encountered love, didn't you?

You should be satisfied with that,
and come back tomorrow.

All of my other customers have done that.

No! I can't stand luck that
only allows me to be with

Koichi for thirty minutes,
and then rips us apart!

Phew...

Next, do the one that captures love!

You can do that, right?

You really don't listen to others, do you?

I said, "do it!"

Phew... Yukako.

Cinderella was able to
encounter a wonderful love,

even though she was bullied,
because she had a pure heart.

Which means you need to have the willingness
for such a wonderful encounter to occur.

Are you able to do that?

Willingness? What are you talking about?

Just changing your physiognomy
isn't enough to change your luck.

Phew...

I became an aesthetician because I admired
the fairy godmother in Cinderella.

I want to live giving happiness
to others, just like her.

You're very beautiful, and I like you.

So I'll do this specially for you.

However...

We're going to have to work on various parts.

Phew...

It's your whole body... The whole body

must be transformed into
a body to capture love.

And the willingness you need to do that is this.

You need to apply this
lipstick every thirty minutes,

except when you're asleep.

It's to maintain your body
after I've worked on it.

If you can do this, you'll have the
luck to capture love for eternity.

The price is 72,000 yen for 24 hours.

Fine. Do it.

Good... Now, don't move.

Make sure you don't open your eyes.

I knew you weren't a normal aesthetician.

Th-This power...

You can see my Cinderella?

I see... so they were Stand powers.

But the more I think about it, I don't care.

If you wanted to harm me,
you would have already tried.

I trust you. You're my fairy godmother.

You startled me...

Just start already.

What a wonderful girl...

All right. I'll work my magic.

Cinderella is a Stand that
transforms the body's image.

This perfectly completes the work
on your body to capture love.

Yukako, your body has become
invincible when it comes to love.

The pain in my stomach suddenly went away...

Oh, this is Yukako's bag! Whoops!

I have to go back and return it to her!

Koichi.

Y-Yukako...

O-Oh, yeah. Here! This is your bag.

Huh?

And this is mine.

I accidentally took it. Sorry about that!

W-Well, I'll see you later.

W-Wait, Koichi!

Look at me.

Don't you feel something
when you look at me?

W-Well... Well...

Well...

Hey! If it isn't Koichi!

Rohan-sensei!

I'm heading to the Kame Yu
department store for research.

Come with me.

I was planning on heading home...

It's embarrassing taking pictures in a
department store by myself, you know.

So please?
What is this?

You're so needy... Jeez.

Wasn't I supposed to become
the invincible heroine?!

What happened to the effectiveness

of your Cinderella's powers?!

Oh, Ko.

No, Koichi's heart definitely
belongs to you now.

Oh, Mom. Sis.

But his reasoning is denying you.

Did something happen between
you and Koichi in the past?

That must be it.

Oh, this gentleman is a manga artist?

He's lovely. May we join you?

But don't worry.

Luck will eventually take your side.

Cinderella is absolute.

By the way, it's 4:45.
It's almost been thirty minutes.

Make sure you don't forget
to apply the lipstick.

Yes, I'm doing it now.

Luck will take my side, huh?

What? You're going to Kame Yu? So are we.

Huh?!

What's with these people?!

There are even more of them!

And now the person I want here
the least, his mother, is here!

Luck is on my side, my ass!

I'll kill that salon bitch!

I guess I'll start taking pictures here.

H-Hey, are you using the flash?

This isn't good, Josuke.

She's been startled, and the
stress is making her disappear!

H-Hey, Old Man! Head outside!

P-Pardon me!

Move out of the way, please!

Huh?

What's going on?

Ah!

Whoa! Sorry, Koichi!

Y-Yukako..

K-Koichi...

This... is luck.

This is it!

Our hearts are understanding each other.

Koichi's heart is flowing into mine...

This is my all...

And my life is going to
change starting now...

Flail

What did she do to you?!

That bitch must have tried
to pull something again!

Calm down! It's not like that...

I just...

It seems I've fallen in love with Yukako.

Huh?

I'm starting to think that her
personality isn't so bad...

It makes me feel warm inside.

Is this love?

I'm not really sure...
Hey, Okuyasu, did you hear him?

Even a Stand would be blown
to the moon if it heard that.

He and Yukako...

Gush

Hey, hey, hey!
You don't have to cry about it!

But, Koichi...

I don't know what led to this sudden 180,

but if you and Yukako both
have feelings for each other,

then there shouldn't be a problem.

That's not it, though...

Yukako has refused to see me ever since.

That's the mystery.

She hasn't come to school for two days.

She won't answer the phone...

She hasn't contacted me
at all. Nothing. That's it.

Y-You mean ever since you guys kissed...

You haven't heard anything?

Not at all.

Hmm... That is very bizarre.

If anything, I admired Yukako
for her dedication to love.

But honestly, I don't think you're going to

get an answer unless you ask Yukako in person.

We really shouldn't get involved...

Y-Yeah...

But if you're in danger, let us know!

We'll be right there!

Thanks. I'm gonna go now.

Yeah.

But...

Damn Koichi! I can't believe he kissed a girl!

Seriously, it's no reason to cry.

Th-That hair!

Yukako!

W-Wait, Yukako!

U-Um...

You've got the wrong person.

U-Um... You looked just
like her from behind, so...

Actually, no, wait!

K-Koichi...

How dare you do this to me,
you stupid dumbass?!

My face just keeps falling apart!

Even if I put on makeup, it just falls off!

You asshole woman!

Turn my face back to normal!

It appears

that you broke your promise.

That's too bad.

I persistently told you to reapply the
Cinderella lipstick every thirty minutes...

I just forgot, that's all!

Wh-What is this? My hands...

They're turning into mush!

Your palm lines and
fingerprints are disappearing.

You shouldn't have broken the promise.

That lipstick was to guarantee your luck.

You need a lot of energy
to change someone's luck.

And now that has gone away.

It's your own fault for
underestimating your luck.

D-Do you want to die?!

Die?

I'm not running a salon for the
sake of ambition and money alone.

I wanted to be like the fairy godmother

in Cinderella who brings people happiness.

It is truly a shame.

I shouldn't have tried to
make your wish come true.

Your face and your palm lines are now gone.

They've been eliminated from this world.

What... did you say?

They've disappeared.

There's no use for someone
who's missing parts.

My face... is gone?

What kind of life does someone
with missing parts live?

Yukako!

K-Koichi!

Why is he...

No, I can't... He'll find me out.

N-No, you've got the wrong person.

Dr. Aya, men aren't
allowed in here, are they?

Hurry and throw him out, please.

It's that personality...

That insanely tough personality.

No doubt about it. You're Yukako.

I sort of fell for that personality...

And that lady is a Stand user, right?

And she did something to you...

It's all over.

I can't go on living.

I'll kill you, Aya Tsuji!

I'll kill you!

Calm down.

That's... P-Part of her face went flying!

There we go.

Phew...

So this is Koichi... Phew...

He was able to figure out that you were

Yukako Yamagishi, even though
your face is different.

Even though you've denied yourself,

some people can see others' personalities.

All right, Yukako.

On his behalf, I'll give you one
last chance as a fairy godmother.

Your last chance is to choose one of these.

Your real face is now gone,

but my Cinderella has memorized
every face we have ever worked on.

Choose your own face out of these.

If you can pick your own face,

it's possible to return your face to normal.

Your palm lines and fingerprints
will return naturally, too.

Just like Cinderella's glass slippers,
pick the one that's the perfect fit for you.

You should've let me do that
to begin with, you dumbass!

I can figure that out easily!

I look at my face in the mirror every day!

But if you choose someone else's face,

that face will never suit you.

In fact, speaking in terms of
my own beauty standards,

I will warn you that your
face will become hideous.

And your luck will be forever based on that face.

Y-Yukako...

Choose carefully.

Remember, your face in the mirror is reversed.

R-Right...

The correct answer is that they're all wrong.

None of the faces there are yours.

If you can figure that out,
I'll fix your face.

That is my rule as Fairy Godmother.

Once I start second-guessing, others
look like they might be mine, too...

But...

This is it! There's no doubt about it!

I know, because it's my own face!

Are you sure?

You'll find out once you try to put it on.

N-No... This isn't it.

My eyes look a bit more slanted.

Wh-Which is it?

I-I really can't tell after all...

What's the matter? Hurry up and choose.

No, I'm not going to choose.

What?

What are you saying?

You want to live your life without a face?

I'm going to have Koichi choose for me.

Because... No matter what face
it is or what luck it carries,

so long as it was chosen by
Koichi, that's all I'll need.

I can live with that.

I won't have any regrets.

B-But that's not...

I don't care.

Please choose, Koichi.

O-Okay...

This is it.

I don't know why, but I have
a feeling it's this one.

But if it's not the right face...

That's Reverb, my Stand.

U-Um, use your Stand to hurt
Reverb's eyes, and make me blind.

You said you wouldn't have any regrets,

but knowing your personality,

I'm sure you won't want me to look
at your face if it's not your own.

Because I've fallen in love with you,

I would really hate for that to happen.

So I think the best solution is
for me to not be able to see.

Koichi...

All right, Yukako...

Yes.

L-Look, Koichi!

It fits perfectly!

Koichi!

We did it, Yukako!

It's because you chose my face for me, Koichi!

Who would have thought he'd say

he'd go blind so he couldn't see her face?

I bent my rules as Fairy Godmother a bit,
but I fixed your face for you.

If I took the eyesight of a boy
who has nothing to do with this,

my reputation as Fairy
Godmother would be tarnished.

Yukako, it seems that you do, at least,
know a good man when you see one.

Salon Cinderella is currently open.

Her makeup will help you encounter love.

Yoshikage Kira Just Wants to Live Quietly, Part 1Good morning. This is Morioh Radio,

brought to you again today
by your neighbor, Kai Harada.

Our first song of the morning is this...

All right, let's eat.

Oh, yes. I have a present for you.

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable

Episode 21     Yoshikage Kira Just Wants to Live Quietly, Part 1

Mr. Kira... Um, Mr. Kira?

Mr. Kira, if you're not busy,
would you like to have lunch with us?

Sorry, but I'll have to pass.

I need to go deliver these documents.

Goodbye.

Give it up!

He never wants to hang out.

Whenever we invite him out somewhere,

I can't tell if he's really having fun or not.

Yoshikage Kira, age 33, single.

He's serious about his work
and gets it done efficiently,

but the guy lacks any passion.

He's not a bad guy, but he just
doesn't stand out very much.

Hey, what are you so grumpy about?

The new girls at work just
invited me to lunch, that's all.

I promised that I'd have lunch with you,

so there's no way I'd go with them.

You heard me decline immediately, didn't you?

Have I ever left you alone? Hm?

Now, stop worrying about it,

and let's pick out some sandwiches together.

Katsu Sandwich

Come on, which one do you want?

Isn't the bread wonderfully soft?

The sandwiches at this shop

use bread that's freshly baked at
11 AM, so they're really popular.

They're usually sold out by 1 PM.

You can feel how warm they are,
even through the wrapper.

The katsu in the katsu sandwiches
are freshly fried, too, and so crispy.

Oh, no.

You broke though the wrapper,
and now the sauce is spilling out.

You naughty girl.

But now this sandwich has a hole in it,

so let's buy the one below it.

Thank you very much.

Morioh is such a beautiful town...

Could there possibly be
another town this wonderful?

It almost feels like we're on a picnic.

She's getting a bit ripe.

I guess it's about time to break up with her...

Time to sever ties.

"Sever ties"...

Maybe I'll go find a new girl,
one who's on vacation or something.

Oh, it's just a dog.

Shigechi!

Oyo?

Josuke, Okuyasu!

Hey, perfect timing, Shigechi.

Sorry this is out of the blue,
but please lend us some lunch money.

We forgot to bring money.

Huh? What are you talking about?

You guys should have your
share from the lottery.

That money's in the bank.

It's a pain to have to get money
from the bank just for some lunch.

A thousand yen will cover both of us.

Yeah.

Come on, please?

We'll go to the bank right after school.

Hey, that bag... You've got a
sandwich from St. Gentlemen!

They actually weren't sold out?

You can't have this! This is my lunch.

Oh, fine. I'll lend you a thousand yen...

That's the spirit!

Thanks!

I'm gonna keep an IOU for this in my planner,

so don't skip out on me.

You're the one who skips out all the time!

Let's see... "June 24th."

Well, anyway, thanks again, Shigechi.

"Lent 1,000 yen"... Lent?

Later!

Um, how do you write the
kanji for "lent" again?

Lent...

Lent

Well, whatever.

I'll just write it in hiragana.

I don't know how to write "Josuke"
or "Okuyasu" in kanji, anyway.

Huh?

M-My sandwich...

Wh-Where is it?

Oh, it's right there.

I feel like it's further away than
it was before, but whatever.

Th-That's...

Hey, Josuke, Okuyasu, wait!

You need to put your
thumbprints on this IOU!

Your thumbprints!

What? That little brat!

He mistook my bag for his and took it?

Jeez, what a pain.

How do we even put our thumbprints on it?

You know, you cut your thumb with a knife...

Y-You don't need to be so dramatic.

Fine, I'll just take your signatures.

Hey, let's hurry up and go to St. Gentlemen.
They're gonna sell out.

This isn't good. If he opens that bag...

She's wearing the ring I bought her.

And my fingerprints are on her...
With the police's investigative skills,

it'll just be a matter of time before
they trace the ring back to me.

I, Yoshikage Kira, have never left a
single clue in the last fifteen years.

And I'm not going to let
that kid do that for me!

Josuke, let's hurry.

Yeah.

I'll be waiting outside.

What should I do?

I'll just have to take it from him.

The best thing to do is to
swipe it without him noticing.

Shigechi!

You're super lucky, damn it.

The St. Gentlemen sandwiches
are already sold out! Damn it!

Oh, I see. So they sold out.

Well, that's too bad.

In that case, I guess I wouldn't mind
selling you mine for 10,000 yen.

You're such a damn cheapskate.

I guess we don't have a choice.
Let's go to Hokaben, Josuke.

Hokaben, huh?

The stuff we could get for
500 yen each with a drink

wouldn't really fill us up.

If we get school lunch as usual,
it'll be plenty, though.

Koichi said he was getting school lunch, too.

No way! He's with Yukako Yamagishi, isn't he?

Why do I have to eat lunch
with a happy couple?

Not to mention, with the lunches there,

the meat's only about a millimeter thick,

and who knows what that stuff
in the miso soup really is?

Hey, there are a lot of drinks in
the prep room in my school's gym.

The gym teacher always sneaks
coffee and tea from there.

All of the teachers are in the
faculty room during lunch,

so I sneak in through the window
sometimes and take some.

Wanna just go buy lunch and come with me?

What the heck? Are you
stealing from the school?

That's pretty cheap.

We can at least buy our drinks.
I'm not that greedy.

See ya!

And I was trying to be nice...

See ya. Oh, and pay me back
my thousand yen tomorrow!

Oh, pardon me!

I wasn't watching where I was going.

Sorry about that.

Crap... It's good that he
parted ways with his friends,

but he's heading back to school.

He's planning to eat it at school...

What should I do?

They were calling him "Shigechi," right?

There's no doubt he'll open
that bag in a matter of minutes...

This is extremely bad.

Now, then... I should be able
to eat my lunch in peace here.

Whoops! I almost forgot!

Before I eat my sandwiches,
I need to brew my coffee.

Since I'm here, I'm gonna have
some coffee before I leave.

You're a lucky boy, Shigechi.

If you had seen what was inside,
I would've had to get rid of you.

Hey, Josuke! This is it!

It's smaller than I thought...

Wh-What?

They just said they wouldn't come here!

Shigechi, you here?

Shigechi!

Oh, hey. It's Okuyasu and Josuke.

We decided we'd have some coffee after all.

Because we got the 500-yen Makunouchi bentos!

Hmph. After calling me greedy and a thief...

You've got some nerve!

Now, now, don't be so stubborn.

People tend to change the
way they think over time.

What should I do?

Eliminating one of them would
be easy, but not so with three.

Damn it! And she's only a few
dozen centimeters away...

Hey, Shigechi, get me a drink, too.

I'd actually like Japanese tea instead of coffee.

Is there any black tea? Like milk tea?

Blech. Makunouchi with milk tea? That's gross.

Damn it! He's planning to
eat his lunch up there.

At this rate, he's going to
open the bag in front of them!

Aw, it's soy sauce again.

The katsu here always come with soy sauce.

Huh? You're supposed to
eat katsu with soy sauce.

What?! You idiot!

You're supposed to eat
it with tonkatsu sauce!

If you used soy sauce, the tonkatsu
sauce would lose its namesake!

Who cares about that?

Yes!

Wh-What?

Crap!

What?

Morioh Landmark #7
Bakery "St. Gentlemen"
How to get there: Get off of the bus
bound for Morioh Budogaoka High
School and walk two minutes. It's a
bakery on the Green Road leading
from the station. It's popular
because of the varieties of bread
made there using a stone oven.
Customers include students,
housewives, and office ladies.
Their most popular items are their
sandwiches, which always sell out.

Crap!

What?

Hey! What are you doing, Josuke?

Hey! You weren't trying to
steal my sandwich, were you?

No! Don't be stupid.

There was a weird sound
that got my attention,

so I was just taking a look.

Don't you dare touch it!

There's no way you would just look at it!

I know you're going to say,

"Their teriyaki chicken sandwich is my
favorite, Shigechi. Give me a bite!"

You sure are a greedy little guy.

You got my tea yet? Where's my tea?

Don't forget, I want milk tea.

I'm just about to make them.

Now!

I did it.

Here you go.

I brought your Japanese tea and milk tea.

Sweet.

Thanks!

What's with you?

Wh-Where did you put m-my sandwich?

Huh? Oh...

Looks like it's gone.

But we don't know what
happened to it, right, Okuyasu?

Yeah.

Stop messing around!

How could you not know?
You're the only ones here!

No, we seriously have no idea!

Seriously, we're not messing around.

No joke, we really have no idea.

Y-You jerks... I-I'm really gonna get mad!

We're telling the truth!

You really need to stop.

Why would we take your sandwich—

We'll find out the truth soon enough!

I just need my Harvest to check the room!

You're such a pest! Yeah, go ahead!

Do it! Look as much as you want.

We wouldn't steal your stupid sandwich.

What? I can't see what
they're doing from in here.

What is that brat trying to do?

Hey!

I know someone's in the prep room!

That's the gym teacher!

Let's get the hell out of here, Shigechi!

B-But my sandwich!

Now's not the time for that!

Hey, come back here!

Damn you, little brats.

I thought it was strange
that my tea and coffee

kept disappearing so fast. No wonder.

I need to be more careful about locking the door.

That was rather messy,

but I got through this hard situation,
and was able to get her back.

I always have to wonder if
I'm protected by luck...

And if I do things with careful
consideration and in a bold manner,

I have a feeling that I can
live a pretty happy life.

That was close.

I'm so glad you came back to me.

Found it!

Why does someone I don't
know have my sandwich?

Why is an adult that I don't know
sneaking around my middle school?

Could it be that you're
talking to me, little boy?

I have no idea what you're talking about.

This is my sandwich.

I just bought it at St. Gentlemen.

No, that bag is mine!

There are reasons why I know!

They're reasons you
wouldn't understand, though.

Take it back, Harvest!

Wh-What? What's going on?
The bag is being pulled...

Wh-Wha?! Wh-What... My sandwich...

Is this... a r-r-real human hand?

Oh, dear. It seems you've seen it.

It also appears, little boy,
that you have the same power I do.

You can see my Harvest?

H-Hey, what's this hand?

Why are you walking around
with just a hand in a bag?

Are you by yourself? Your two friends...

I believe you called them Josuke and Okuyasu?

Do they have a power similar to yours?

Hey! Don't move!

If you move even a bit, I'm gonna attack!

You're a really creepy guy!
Don't come any closer to me!

I get a really creepy,
unfamiliar feeling from you!

Don't move! Don't move from there!

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old.

My house is in the northeast section
of Morioh, where all the villas are,

and I am not married.

I work as an employee for the
Kame Yu department stores,

and I get home every day
by 8 PM at the latest.

I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.

I'm in bed by 11 PM,

and make sure I get eight hours
of sleep, no matter what.

After having a glass of warm milk

and doing about twenty minutes of
stretches before going to bed,

I usually have no problems
sleeping until morning.

Just like a baby, I wake up without
any fatigue or stress in the morning.

I was told there were no
issues at my last checkup.

Wh-What are you talking about?!

I'm trying to explain that I'm a person
who wishes to live a very quiet life.

I take care not to trouble myself

with any enemies, like winning and losing,

that would cause me to lose sleep at night.

That is how I deal with society,

and I know that is what brings me happiness.

Although, if I were to fight,
I wouldn't lose to anyone.

Basically, Shigechi,

you are a troublesome thing
that would hinder my sleep,

therefore my enemy.

Th-That's...

Deadly Queen... is what I've named it.

I'm going to eliminate you now
before you have a chance to speak,

so I can sleep soundly again tonight.

Episode 22
Yoshikage Kira Just Wants to Live Quietly, Part 2

Episode 22
Yoshikage Kira Just Wants to Live Quietly, Part 2Deadly Queen... is what I've named it.

I'm going to eliminate you now,

so I can sleep soundly again tonight.

I warned you not to move!

Don't underestimate Harvest!

There are this many?

Not only that, but crushing three
or four did no damage, either.

If you move any more,

I'll cut that something-or-other
artery in your neck!

Oh, yeah! It's the one called the "carotid"!

I'm gonna cut it! My Harvest is invincible!

And it looks like your Stand

is the type that has power,
but can't go very far.

Looks like its range is about
one to two meters, right?

If you want to die, go ahead and try to move.

I see... So individual users have
their own unique powers?

Stand? Hmm... Stand, eh?

By the way, my Deadly Queen
also has a special power...

He has something... Grab it!

What? It's just a 100-yen coin.

What were you planning to do with this?

Well, I thought I'd show you my
Deadly Queen's special power,

seeing as how you're already
as good as done for.

Deadly Queen's special power

is that it can turn anything
it touches into a bomb.

Anything...

Even a 100-yen coin.

Throw away that 100-yen coin, Harvest!

Now I can relax and sleep well tonight.

Episode 22     Yoshikage Kira Just Wants to Live Quietly, Part 2

Did you know there's a salon
that'll grant you love?

Huh? Seriously? That's hilarious.

It's true! I hear it worked for
someone in the high school!

Looks like one blast didn't kill him...

Wh-What happened to me? What...

What the...

What the heck happened?!

I told you.

My Deadly Queen can turn
anything it touches into a bomb.

I turned this 100-yen coin into a bomb.

I can push the switch whenever I want,

and my opponent is blown
to bits from the inside out.

Though in your case, Shigechi,

half of your face blew into your head,

and about a third of your brain got
mixed in with the flesh of your face.

Before I deal one more blow
to you, I just remembered

there's something that I
want to confirm with you.

You called this power a "Stand."

That Josuke and Okuyasu also
have Stand powers, don't they?

H-Help me...

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

You must die.

I can't leave witnesses alive.

No one is allowed to know the true
identity of one Yoshikage Kira.

But you see, I'd like to
know about Stand users.

I'm sure I'd be able to find out

with some research, but I'd
like to ask you personally.

Josuke, Okuyasu...

Who are the others?

How many more are in this town?

What are their powers?

I-I don't know...

I'm certain you must know.

Listen, if you don't tell me...

I will eliminate your parents, too.

Wha...

What?

M-My mama and papa?

Hurry up and tell me.

If you do, nothing will happen to them.

If you take too long,
someone might show up here.

Just names will do. Come on, hurry it up.

E-Everyone was saying they were
looking for a murderer in this town!

A murderer... They meant you!

You killed Reimi Sugimoto, too!

What? Reimi Sugimoto?!

You're still able to use your Stand?

Deadly Queen!

That brat...

He was so torn-up, too.

I-I'm... gonna go to Josuke...

Josuke's Shining Diamond...

can fix me...

I'm... going to protect Mama and Papa...

I'm gonna protect Mama and Papa from him!

That nasty, filthy guy

can't live in the same town as Mama and Papa!

High School Ahead
No middle school students beyond this point
—Middle School Principal

I have to go...

to Josuke...

Oh, sorry.

Are you okay?

I have to go...

You don't look so good.

He's from the middle school.

Th-There's something wrong with him.

We should get a teacher...

No, just leave him alone. He's creepy.

Let's go.

J-Josuke!

J-Josuke!

You said everyone was looking for me?

Do you mean there's someone in this town

who knows about Reimi Sugimoto's murder?

But no one will be able to pursue me...

No one knows the identity of Yoshikage Kira.

As long as you are out of the picture...

I'm gonna protect my Mama and Papa...

Deadly Queen has already
touched the doorknob.

Josuke!

This is Deadly Queen's power.

He's been eliminated without a trace.

Did someone call my name just now?

Yeah, I heard it, too.

H-Hey, Josuke, look!

I... found... you!

Sh-Shigechi?!

Shigechi!

S-Something's not right, Josuke!

Harvest was gushing blood
when it disappeared.

That's not a normal way
for a Stand to disappear!

Why did just one of them
show up in front of us?

Let's go to the middle school.

We have to find Shigechi!

Oh, dear. Where did that fall off?

Well, I guess I can't help it now.

I hope my usual tailor
has the same button...

How horrible...

It happened again. It's him again...

Another soul killed by him is flying away...

He must have encountered him.

Shigechi...

There's no doubt about it.

This boy is dead.

Shigekiyo encountered him,
and was killed by him.

I can tell.

Though I don't know why he encountered him,

or how he was killed.

But it was definitely him.

I can tell it was him because he killed me.

I looked for Shigechi everywhere,
but couldn't find him.

He disappeared within just five minutes

after Okuyasu and I separated from him.

Shigechi's books and school
supplies were all left behind,

and his parents have
requested a police search.

That probably means...

Y-You're saying... The culprit is a Stand user?

You guys probably don't
know much about Shigechi,

but I can't imagine there's anyone
who can beat Shigechi's Harvest.

This guy killed Shigechi within five minutes,

and managed to hide his body
somewhere within the school.

Jotaro, now that it's clear
we're dealing with a Stand user,

we'll have to help out, as well.

Josuke.

I heard you picked up a button.

Yeah... One of the Harvests brought it to me.

This is it.

This is Shigechi's final message.

It could be that Harvest ripped it off of
the murderer's clothes and brought it to you.

Let me hold on to this button.

I'll do some research.

Y-You can locate the guy with the kind
of button you could find anywhere?

It's possible.

We might be able to figure out the brand
of the clothes and where it came from.

I see...

I-If we're done talking, I'm gonna go home.

I-I'm kind of in a weird mood.

I-I'm really annoyed...

Let's go home, Dad.

There's something wrong with Okuyasu.

Yeah... Shigechi was a greedy,
irritating little punk,

but he was the type you
just couldn't leave alone.

We can't believe he's gone.

Not to mention, he must feel
annoyed because he can't tell

if he should be angry or sad right now.

We both feel that way.

I'm sure Okuyasu feels it far more.

Damn it...

It appears something awful has
happened outside my notice.

I'm going to warn all the customers
who come to my restaurant.

Phew... I don't think he'll come
to my place, but just in case...

Stand users eventually attract
other Stand users...

Though I never want to meet that guy.

So now everyone's going to take action, huh?

Oh?

That was Josuke just now...

And Okuyasu was there, too.

Hey, listen to this.

Last Friday was my birthday, right?

The guy I'm seeing gave me this
super lame ring as a present.

Look at it! Why would I want this thing?

Though I still put on an act like,
"Oh, my gosh! I'm so happy!"

I was dating him because
his dad owns some land,

but he's a total bumpkin.

This really is a kiddie ring. How much was it?

Probably around 150,000 yen.

I'm gonna go pawn it off for some money.

It doesn't compliment my
beautiful fingers at all.

That woman's heart is ugly,

but her hands and face are beautiful...

If she comes to me, she can
date me with a cleansed soul.

Oh, I have to go. See you later.

Okay, bye-bye!

I'm afraid we'll have to part ways now.

Let's keep this farewell clean.

Good morning. This is Morioh Radio,

brought to you again today
by your neighbor, Kai Harada.

How is the beginning of the
new week treating you so far?

Already, there are only three days left in June.

Now, let's eat.

And once it's July...
That's right, it's vacation season.

Oh, yes.

I've got several errands to run today,

What plans do you all have?

so I'd like you to stay home.

I can't wait.

And now, the perfect song for this sunny day

Let's eat dinner together when I get back.

in the middle of the rainy season. Here you go.

Thank goodness they still
had the Parisian special.

Talk about lucky!

Let's hurry up and go to Yohee Lake.

Wait, Asuka's not here yet.

What? What's taking her so long?

It's been four days since Shigechi's incident...

Nothing has really happened since, but...

There's no doubt that there's a
killer somewhere in this town.

Honestly, anyone can look suspicious,

yet anyone can also look
completely innocent.

Ah... H-Hello, Jotaro.

Um, did you find anything out since last time?

Like, about the murderer's button, or...

No, not really.

There's nothing yet.

I-I see...

Um, where are you going?

Nowhere, really.

Just over there.

Ah...

Oh, man... He doesn't really talk, so it's
hard to have a conversation with him.

Rohan-sensei is scary because he's so
overbearing, but Jotaro's silence is scary, too.

Isn't there something
we can talk about? Um...

That's a very lovely coat!

Centipede Shoes

This store appears to be a shoe store.

Huh? Oh! Yes, it's a shoe store.

Is there something wrong?

We also do simple tailoring

It's a shoe store, but they also do things

on the side, like fixing waist measurements
on skirts and hemming pants.

There's also an electronics
shop that sells flowers.

Is there something wrong?

I heard about all of the
tailors around Morioh,

but I didn't think to ask about places like this.

Something wrong with this button?

No, if you haven't seen it
before, don't worry about it.

I just couldn't remember what
it was originally attached to.

Little boy, would you
like an animal cracker?
Animal Crackers

I always eat the camel last,
so you can have any of the others.

No, thank you.

Oh, okay.

But not only have I seen that button before,

but look, I just finished repairing
the suit it came off of.

A customer came in yesterday,

asking me to put on the exact same button.

See? It's the exact same button.

Jotaro!

Good grief. We found it, Koichi.

Found it?

Oh, n-nothing...

M-More importantly, what did
the customer look like?

Do you know his name?

His name?

Well, of course I do. What do you take me for?

I remember all of my customers' names.

That's how you're supposed
to treat customers,

even if you have hundreds or thousands!

Really?

Yes! That's amazing!
Could you tell us his name?

Anyway, the jacket has an order tag on it.

Of course I remember it...
Even out of hundreds.

But I figure it might be faster to look.

Let's see...

Kira

The last name is... How do you read this?

I think it's...

Wh-What is it? M-May I see it?

Um... Um...

Look over here.

Wh-What the?! My hand!

Look over here.

J-Jotaro! L-Look!

Watch out, Koichi! Don't go any closer!

Hey, I told you to look over here.

Is that his Stand?!

J-Jotaro!

H-He's here! He's taking the jacket!

To think someone would actually investigate
the button that fell off my jacket...

Did they see my name?

Why do things like this keep
happening to me lately?

Good grief.

Who would've thought he'd
come to get his suit now?

But I will make them disappear

with Deadly Queen's second bomb.

Just like that brat Shigechi...

It's still moving!

The jacket is evidence!

Wait!

Don't run after it without thinking.

The way that jacket is being
pulled is suspicious.

Something about that Stand...

is dangerous!

Is that his Stand?!

J-Jotaro!

H-He's here! He's taking the jacket!

Good grief.

Who would've thought he'd
come to get his suit now?

The jacket is evidence!

Wait!

Don't run after it without thinking.

Centipede Shoes

It's a bomb... It's a bomb Stand!

So this is how it got Shigechi?

That's why we couldn't find him,
no matter where we looked.

He's... He's getting away!

Don't go after him, Koichi.

Huh? Don't go after him?

What are you saying?

If we go after him,

we'll get to see the face of the person
who killed Reimi and Shigechi!

We need to cautiously
observe and act, Koichi.

Wh-What are you talking about?

We just happened to miss the
name tag on that jacket.

But considering how big the jacket was,

we can tell that the guy's
about 175 centimeters tall.

He's an office employee, and not married.

If he had a wife,

he wouldn't have brought his
jacket here for a button repair.

He's between the ages of 25 and 35,
and he looks pretty rich.

Judging from the material and design,
that jacket was a high-end brand.

Even if we don't follow him now,

we've significantly narrowed
down who it might be.

I-I see...

W-Wait! That doesn't mean
we shouldn't go after him!

He's a murderer!

It's not that I don't want to
pursue him, but we can't.

Because that bomb Stand
is somewhere over there.

Huh?! The Stand?

Y-You saw it?

I didn't see it, but it must be there.

Slowly walk outside through the door.

It "must be"? Hang on.

How can you know it must
be there if you can't see it?

If he were the kind of guy to leave right
after getting rid of the shop owner,

then he never could've kept getting
away with killing for fifteen years.

He's someone who gets rid of all evidence.

Which means he plans to get rid of us.

Hold on a sec... Aren't you being too cautious?

If the Stand isn't here,

the murderer must be far away
with that jacket by now.

Listen up, Koichi.

Observing doesn't simply mean to look.
It means to look carefully.

Look

Look
Carefully

It doesn't mean to just
listen, but to listen well.

Listen

Listen
Well

Otherwise,

we're going to die.

H-He's sounding high-and-mighty,
but my Reverb isn't useless.

It's matured a lot, so isn't
Jotaro underestimating me a bit?

I wonder if the bomb Stand
is really still around.

If it's not, we're gonna look really stupid!

Look over here.

I-It's really here!

I-If I keep touching it, it'll explode!

Star Platinum!

After all those hits I landed...
This thing's pretty hard.

It's going to explode!

Star Platinum! The World!

I hate doing anything that's tiring,
so I'm going to destroy you now.

Y-Yes! You must have stopped time.

Now no matter how much we
touch it, it won't explode!

I will make sure the people searching for me

die in an explosion.

My Deadly Queen's Heart Attack
always gets its prey, no matter what.

I-Impossible! It wasn't destroyed
by Star Platinum's power!

A-A Stand that's this hard... Impossible!

Stay back, Koichi.

It's still perfectly fine!
It hasn't slowed down at all!

Get back, Koichi!

Y-You've hit it so much that you're hurt,

but it hasn't sustained any damage!

Get further back, Koichi!

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

What are you doing?!

It'll explode if you're touching it!
Let it go, quickly!

Look over here.

Good grief. I've never met
such a sturdy Stand.

I think my confidence is going to break first.

J-Jotaro, at this rate,
it's going to blow us up!

You need to get further away.

This time, I'm going to take it apart for sure.

I-I'd like to say something.

A Stand controlled from far away

doesn't move with that much power.

But that thing's power and explosive attacks...

The power behind those explosions wouldn't
be possible if the user wasn't nearby.

The user should be within fifteen...
no, ten meters of here!

And?

"And"?! It's ten meters!

My Reverb has a range of fifty meters!

It can find the culprit!

I told you, Koichi. Don't go after him.

You just need to think about protecting
yourself with your Reverb.

Don't do anything else.

Wh-Why?!

The culprit is no longer nearby.

This is a remotely controlled Stand.

I've had many encounters with
various Stands, so I know.

Look over here.

Its actions are too simple for it
to be controlled from nearby.

You know from experience?

That's not logical at all!

There's no way a Stand that powerful
can be controlled from far away.

The user has to be close by!

So Jotaro really is underestimating me.

I've grown, too!

I can find the culprit and defeat him, too!

Distance, ten meters.

H-He's there! That's him! He has the jacket!

But something's weird...
H-He's too far away.

He's more than fifty meters away...

And he's only getting further away.

He's outside Reverb's range!

Th-The bomb Stand is being
controlled from far away?

That's impossible!

Having that power and being
that far away is inconceivable!

Look over here!

Wh-What? It's heading toward me?!

I figured it out.

That Stand goes after things
with higher temperatures first.

That's why it's so powerful,
despite being controlled from far away.

Bring out Reverb and protect yourself!

Even if I stop time, you're too far away!

C-Crap!

Reverb is...

fifty meters away, where the culprit is!

I'm sorry!

Good grief.

Star Platinum! The World!

The reason this thing attacked
the shop owner first

was because he had a hot drink.

And it targeted Koichi because

his body temperature rose
from being so worked up.

If there's something hotter,
it should go toward that.

Time has begun to move again.

I was right.

It goes after things with the
highest temperature first.

I'm saved...

But if body temperature is
enough to make it explode,

then when it's near fire...

This power...

Huh?!

How could this happen?
This is all my fault, Jotaro!

This happened because I went after the culprit.

If he hadn't caused the fire for my
sake, it wouldn't have gotten him!

Wake up, Jotaro!

Jotaro! Jotaro!

That explosion wasn't a human!

Look over here.

It's going to deal the final blow!

It's too strong!

It's just like Jotaro said!

It'll attack something that's hotter
than body temperature first.

Look over here.

I have to take this chance to run!

I want to call Josuke.

He'll fix Jotaro!

I have to call him!

This is... the kitchen!

There's plenty of heat here!

I need to buy some time
and run out that door.

There's a phone!

W-Wait a sec! It's not a gas stove!

Why does this house have an electric stove?!

It's going to take some time to warm up!

The oven's electric, too!

Wh-What should I...

I know! There should be some hot water.

Go over there!

It's empty!

Look over here.

Wait. If I observe carefully, like Jotaro said...

This thing has a weakness!

A weakness I didn't notice earlier!

And I'm starting to get pissed off.

Why do I have to regretfully run away

in fear from a murderer, like,
"Please, God, save me"?

Shouldn't it be the other way around?

Why do I have to think that I'd rather

be looking for a public restroom while

I have diarrhea if I could only get
out of this situation safely?

Isn't something wrong?

The one who should be
running away in fear...

is you, murderer!

It always attacks based on temperature...

But that's exactly what your weakness is!

The fact that you never give up
on that is your weakness!

It's been almost three minutes.

I don't know what's going
on at that shoe store,

but there's one thing I can say with
more faith than anything in this world.

Heart Attack has no weaknesses.

It'll track down its target, no matter what.

Now, then... Since that's over with,
I have to call Josuke on the phone.

He should be home now...

Sizzle

Now that thing's lost track of us.

Keep chasing after the word "sizzle" forever...

Just like a donkey chasing after a
carrot hanging in front of its face.

That's what your weakness is.

Hello, Higashikata residence.

Josuke, this is Koichi! There's trouble!

Jotaro is hurt bad, and it's my fault.
Please hurry and get here!

What?! Don't say that so suddenly!

I don't get what you're talking about!

Just hurry up and get over here.
It finally happened!

We encountered the murderer!

I've captured his Stand here.

What did you capture?!

Say it so I can understand! Where are you?

Wh-What's happening?

Ow, hot! I turned it off, but now
it's getting hotter and hotter.

What's with this piece of crap?

How can you cook anything good with this?!

Hey! I'm asking you where you are, Koichi!

Look over here.

Crap! It's ignoring the
letters and coming this way!

Koichi, where are you?
Hurry up and tell me, you dumbass!

I'm at Centipede Shoes! Hurry!

Crap, Reverb's tail letters also...

Reverb's tail letters got destroyed!

The damage...

That explosion wasn't a human.

Look over here.

A-Again! It's coming after me again.

But I can't use the tail letters anymore.

Wh-What am I going to do?

How can I fight it?

Reverb Act 2!

What's wrong, Reverb Act 2?!

Act 2!

Where are you, Act 2?!
Why won't you come?!

Act 2 was killed in the explosion!

It's split in two!

N-No, wait...

If the explosion killed it, I'd be
dead too, because I'm the user.

N-Now I remember! It looked
like Reverb died once before, too.

A-And then...

C-Could it be...

Boooom

Reverb Act 3!

Um, is that who you are, sir?

Please give me orders.

D-Does this mean I've grown?!

You're amazing, Act 3!

Please give me orders.

Er, I don't know what your
powers are, so... F-For now...

Please protect us, Act 3!

Um, protect us, please.
You can do that, right?

Understood.

This enemy has a seriously heavy power.

S-H-I-T.

I pushed, but I lost.

You pushed and lost? You can't be serious!

I'm telling you to protect us!

I have finished protecting us,

just like you ordered.

Look over here.

You finished?! In what way?!

You're completely useless!
We haven't grown at all!

Look over he—

Wh-What?

This is taking far too long.

Why is Heart Attack taking so long?

Wh-What's going on? My left hand just...

My left hand that released
Heart Attack just suddenly...

Sir, what's wrong? Are you all right?

Oh, it's nothing.
Allow me to pay for the cup.

I'll be leaving, so can I get my check?

Th-This is...

M-My left hand... is heavy!

S-Sir?

I-Impossible! My left hand! My left hand...

It feels like there's a 40
or 50 kilogram weight on it.

What's going on over there?

Sir, are you all right?

D-Don't mind me.

Please, allow me to give you a hand.

It's heavy!

What are you doing, sir? How could you?

It's sunken into the pavement
and having a hard time moving...

Act 3! What did you do? This power...

3 Freeze!

I've rhymed "three" and "free."

Act 3, what is this power?

Why is it moving slower? Tell me.

There's really nothing to explain about it.

It's heavy...

For whatever reason,
Heart Attack has gotten heavy.

This isn't good. I need to retrieve it.

I have to go retrieve Heart Attack myself.

And to think that I'm experiencing this

To think that the invincible auto-pilot
Heart Attack would get caught...

Damn... I have to undo this spell somehow...

Hey, mister. You okay?

You sick or something?

Want me to call your mommy?

It's nothing. Get lost.

Hey, hey, hey, did you hear that?

You seeing some sweet dreams during the
day after drinking too much, mister?

Is it fun? Does it feel good?

Grasp

That's a nice suit you've got on.

We've been fired and don't have any money.

We can't even get any bitches.

Seeing guys like you piss me off.

At least try to defend yourself.

Hey, mister. Your shoelaces are untied.

I'll tie them for you.

A square knot! That's super nice of you!

H-Hey, what's wrong?

Deadly Queen's first bomb.

It turns anything it touches into a bomb.

Th-The doctor! Call the doctor!

What a terrible day.

Get me a doctor!

I just want to live a quiet life,

and yet I had to deal with those
two pieces of trash today...

Episode 24     Heart Attack, Part 2

Hey, Josuke.

What the heck happened at Centipede Shoes?

I don't really know, but it wasn't good.

Hurry! It'll take about five minutes.

There are cracks in it.

That means the bomb Stand's user
has been damaged, too, right?

Please don't go too far away from me.

My range is five meters.

Act 3's is five meters.

We have matured.

We're even more powerful now.

It can't be helped that my
range is shorter than Act 2's.

Gravity
If you move more than five meters from me,
5 Meters

the weight on that thing will disappear.

It'll stop struggling and regain its vigor,

and rush toward us like a dog in heat.

On the other hand, the closer you get to it,

the heavier I can make it.

What would you like to do?

N-No... This distance is plenty.

I hope Josuke gets here soon.

Apparently, a gym will be opening
near Budogaoka High School soon.

I was really considering
getting a membership.

I have to gain more stamina.

But I wonder if I'll be
lifting the same dumbbells

who've been playing with their dicks
after not bathing for a week,

or getting in the same pool with them.

It took me three minutes to get here.

I felt my lack of stamina the most
when I tried to cross at the crosswalk.

By the way, who's going to show up here?

You called someone for help, didn't you?

Josuke Higashikata and Okuyasu
Nijimura live the closest.

It'll take them about five minutes,
so two minutes to go?

You're their friend, aren't you?

H-H...

Yukako Yamagishi and the woman

who runs Salon Cinderella are also
what you call Stand users, aren't they?

You wouldn't actually call
a lady for help, would you?

H-He's...

I left my jacket with the button behind.

I'll go get it later...

After I'm done with you.

H-He's... right in front of me!

This man...

The one who killed all those people
over all those years...

And Reimi and Shigechi...

Let him have it, Act 3!

Dogyuun

Deadly Queen!

Why does he have two Stands?

I thought a user could only have one Stand!

Heart Attack is a tracer bomb that was
launched from Deadly Queen's left hand.

That's why the damage
is only in my left hand.

Warning, Sir Koichi.

You have just left my range of five meters.

The bomb Stand's weight will disappear.

S-h-i-t. I'll have to attack
it with 3 Freeze again.

I see... Range, eh?

Who would you like me to hit?

The actual murderer,
or that shitty bomb Stand?

3 Freeze cannot make two
things heavy at once.

Even if we make the user heavier,

the bomb Stand is on
auto-pilot, so it won't stop.

Even if we make the bomb heavier,
the user will come after me.

Which will it be?

Please hurry and give me orders.

Which one are you going to attack?

S-Stop the bomb!

3 Freeze!

Ker-bam-bam

It appears that, no matter who you attacked,
you were still fated to lose.

However, to think that Heart Attack,
which I thought had no weak points,

would be completely useless...

I had to pay some expenses at the café,

then ended up in a scuffle with some
hooligans. I feel like I've been had.

This is the first time

I've ever felt so cornered.

I even feel a slight sense of defeat.

Goodness. I must show you some respect.

You're rather impressive.

By the way, do you have any pocket tissues?

A handkerchief would work, too.

Hm? I've shown you some respect.

The least you can do is talk to me.

I don't... have any.

Then, here. Use mine.

A lot of blood is coming from your nose, right?

It's just so you can wipe that off.

I'm about to beat you to death.

I have a little over a minute
before your friends get here.

Otherwise, I just won't be satisfied after
having to face such humiliation in public.

Now, now, stop screaming
in such a weird way.

I endured the same pain you feel now

as I was heading over here, but I didn't scream.

You're a boy, aren't you?

You should take after me.

See? You need some tissues now, don't you?

I'll wipe it for you.

They say your brain slows down
when your nose is stuffed up.

But you know, I was on the ground
a little while ago, too, just like you.

I'll blow you away with
Deadly Queen in another minute.

Until then, you need to be like
me and just endure the pain.

You need to be like me!

Y-Your name...

is Yoshikage Kira...

Yoshikage Kira is your real name...

My driver's license!

When did you take it out of my wallet?

You little brat...

You said you paid some expenses
at the café earlier, right?

That's when I had an idea.

So what?

What do you gain from knowing my name?

You're about to be erased.

Yeah, you're about to kill me.

But even I was able to figure out your name.

You're not that big a deal.

You might get away for now,
but how do you feel?

A little brat like me managed
to find out what your name was.

I'll say it again.

A little brat found you out!

You're a complete idiot!

I'll be looking forward to
seeing you in the next world!

You bastard!

Damn it! What is this sense of defeat?!

I still have a minute before

And I was trying to beat the crap
out of him to calm myself down.

He's got his socks on inside-out.

Doesn't that bug him?

Ugh, it sure bugs me!

Not that way, Okuyasu!

But Centipede Shoes is this way.

If we go this way, we'll get
there in a minute! Hurry up!

Wear them properly.

Now I can finally relax.

And now I can blow you to kingdom come!

Deadly Queen!

The tip of this finger can
turn anything into a bomb.

I guess, in your case, I'll make
your student badge a bomb.

The first bomb!

Koichi, you were winning against
that man psychologically.

What?!

Well, this is a surprise.

I never thought you'd be able
to stand with those wounds...

However, you would have been much
better off if you had stayed down.

I can almost see the view behind
you through your wounds.

That's a nice watch.

But I'll break it so you can never
see the time on it again...

By that, I mean I'll break your face.

You seem like quite an interesting fellow.

I'd love to learn your name,
as well as various other things,

but I must take my leave.

I only have twenty seconds left.

I don't have time for idle chit-chat.

Your Stand just now was very weak.

I was easily able to catch it, like a pop-up.

Do you really think you can defeat
my Deadly Queen with so little power?

Smash

Wh—

H-He's fast...

Wh-What's with this speed?

Upon closer inspection...
Good grief, what an ugly watch.

But you won't have to worry
about that anymore...

Because your face is going to end up

even uglier.

What is this Stand?

It's so fast, it's like it stopped time!

Koichi, if it weren't for you,
I would have been dead.

You did well fighting all by yourself.

You have my respect, Koichi.

You've matured.

Hey, Koichi!

Koichi!

Wh-What the heck happened here?

K-Koichi! Jotaro!

Be careful, Okuyasu.

What the heck happened?! Jotaro! Koichi!

Calm down. I need to find out
if Koichi is alive or not.

If he's alive, I can fix his
wounds with Shining Diamond.

Yes! Jotaro is alive! Just barely, though.

K-Koichi's alive, too.
But he's not breathing!

Hurry! Hurry up and fix him, Josuke!

Hey, he's not waking up at all!

But I've already fixed him up.

This is awful... Josuke and Okuyasu are here.

He's hurt really bad!

It's gonna take a while for
him to regain consciousness.

What a day... I've never had
such an awful day in my life.

I have always been able to
get through any dilemma...

I'm going to get away, no matter what.

What are you doing?

Hey, he's awake.

Hey, don't try anything funny.

Turn this way slowly. Show us your face!

Be careful! Don't go to Centipede Shoes!

There's going to be some crazy explosion!

The owner just suddenly came flying out!

Those two, too!

An explosion?

H-Hey, calm down. Were you caught in the blast?

I'm just an office employee.

But now I'm going to die...
Look at all this blood.

I-It hurts!

H-Hey, calm down. It's all right now.

I'll patch you up.

Where did you get hurt?

I think one of my ribs might
have punctured my lung.

H-Hurry up and fix me, please!

Hurry?

Oh? No matter how you look at me,
I just look like a high school student,

so why would you ask me to fix you?

I have trouble just getting
into pachinko parlors,

yet I look like some doctor who
graduated from med school to you?

You totally fell for it.

You saw my Shining Diamond, didn't you?

Crap... I got too impatient.

Which means you're the enemy.

This was a draw.

Th-This guy's the murderer?!

I guess this means I've lost.

Yes, the one you're all looking for is me.

My face has been seen,
my Stand has been seen,

and my name has been discovered.

It appears I won't be able to
sleep peacefully anymore...

But only tonight!

Deadly Queen!

What the hell are you doing?!

Exactly what it looks like. I cut it off.

I-It hurts... It's so painful,
and I'm bleeding a lot.

I'm even crying.

But winning or losing means nothing to me.

I'm going to survive.

I'm going to survive in peace.

I have to live with the fate of being
unable to fight the urge to kill people,

but I will live happily!

Heart Attack, you are free!

I leave the rest to you.

Protect me.

What the hell is that wimpy-looking thing?

Josuke, that's a bomb Stand
that goes after body heat!

And it won't break!

It's going to explode in reaction
to your body temperature!

It won't break?

Break?

You've got it backwards. I fixed it.

If that guy left it behind...

This is a pretty gross idea, but that
hand is heading toward the murderer.

Let's go after it!

Yeah!

You're not getting away that easily, dumbass!

H-Hey, look at that...

Now I'll be able to sleep peacefully...

K-Kira? Why is your face all bloody?

Hello, everyone. Is it
already time to head home?

I'm in a hurry, so I'll be seeing you.

The murderer's name is Yoshikage Kira.

His address is Morioh Kotodai 1-128.

He's 33 years old.

His Stand is a short-ranged
bomb Stand, Deadly Queen!

Hey, where is that guy headed?

It doesn't matter where
he's headed. He's finished!

He's in this building.

Hey, wait... This is...

Salon Cinderella!

What's he doing here?!

A-Aya! Are you here?

Dr. Aya Tsuji!

A-Aya's...

Aya's...

What is this? What the hell is this?!

He's dead... Why is Yoshikage Kira dead?

Aya!

Th-This is...

What the hell happened?

Wait! That man isn't Yoshikage Kira!
He has his left hand!

Huh?

He d-doesn't have a face!

What?!

He's missing his fingerprints on his
right hand, too. Who is this guy?

Guy...

He's wearing the same suit...

He brought in that guy,
and killed him in front of me.

He's too terrifying...

He made me switch his face using Cinderella.

And his hair and fingerprints, by force...

So he's someone else now?

Yes...

H-His face...

Shining Diamond!

H-His...

Josuke, don't touch her! Get away from there!

His face...

Aya!

On the other side of that door!

You're not getting away, damn it!

Th-This is...

I-It's time for everyone to go home...

S-So many...

Wh-Which one is he?
Which one is Yoshikage Kira?!

Yoshikage Kira, you coward! Show yourself!

He managed to get away.

He's not going to be quivering, or hiding.

He's not even going to leave Morioh.

He's going to live his life in
this town, like he always has.

Aya Tsuji: dead.

Episode 25
Heart Father

Episode 25
Heart FatherI met that boring man

when I was going to community college.

He went to a pretty upper-rank
college in the area,

and my friends were envious
because he was quiet and cool,

so I went out with him to feel superior.

We had a child.

I see. Because it's three times the
speed, the picture quality's...

Hey, Hayato. No "hello" for your mother?

Hi.

My husband's not a bad man.

It's not as if he drinks a lot,

and even though he doesn't earn much,

he always goes to work.

Kosaku Kawajiri
Shinobu
Hayato

But...

I'm a woman who married
without ever knowing love.

Hmph. He's home.

He only knows the words
"food," "bath," and "sleep."

That boring man...

I'm home.

Where's dinner?

Oh, you're home? I didn't even notice.

I was really busy today,
so that's all there is.

But it's your favorite, isn't it?

Ramen
Land

Is he mad?

If you have the guts to
get mad, then get mad.

I'm sure you're just going to eat your
dinner silently as usual, though.

Good evening! This is Morioh Radio,

brought to you again today by
your neighbor, Kai Harada.

What are you doing?

How's your evening going so far?

Here's a perfect song to end the day...

Episode 25     Heart Father

Fifteen minutes by car from Morioh Station...

His house was in the villa and resort area.

Morioh Station
Yoshikage Kira's House

Rather, it was Yoshikage Kira's house
when that was still who he was.

Kira

He has now gained a new face,
family registry, job,

and a different place to call home.

I'm sure he'll never try
to come near here again.

There aren't any corpses
in the fridge, are there?

But we had to search the place.

Because now that he's someone else,

the only clues we could possibly
find on him would be in this house.

Is that his album?

That totally looks like him.

Third Grade Summer
Summer Camp
7-25-1974

Yoshikage Kira...

Born in Morioh Town on January 30th, 1966.

His height is 175 centimeters,
weight is 65 kilograms,

and his blood type is A.

He was born to parents of advanced age.

His father, Yoshihiro, died of
illness when Yoshikage was 21,

and his mother died of old age not long after.

In 1988, he graduated from
D Academy's Department of Literature.

That same year, he started working for
S City's Kame Yu department store.

He transferred to the Morioh branch in 1993.

No previous criminal record. No record
of getting married. No close friends.

No girlfriend. No surgeries.

It's impossible to find him using
fingerprints, teeth, or surgery scars.

That's all rather vague information.

Look. These trophies and awards...

High School Music Recital
Violin
3rd Place
Yoshikage Kira

They're all third place.

Middle School Track Meet
200 Meter Hurdles
3rd Place
Yoshikage Kira

He definitely wasn't the school hero.

Award
Grade School
Writing Contest
Overall 3rd Place

And it's hard to tell what he was good at.

Sports? Music? Writing?

Even in this photo, he's positioned
so he doesn't stand out.

No one envied him or ridiculed him...

He's a man who doesn't show his
strengths or weaknesses to anyone.

Which means...

Of course, all this was deliberate.

He was hiding his high intellect and abilities.

He knew that was the best
way to stay out of trouble.

I came here hoping we could possibly
find one of his hobbies, but...

Hobbies? Come to think of it,

he seems to have kept several jars in a drawer.

See?

It looks like some sort of scrapings in them.

And what are these numbers?

"1983"... Maybe it's the year.

They have a faint smell.
What do you think they are?

They appear to be nail clippings.

Huh?

Wh-Whose nails are they?!

Th-They couldn't be...

No, they're his own nails.
They're not from his victims.

He's kept very meticulous data in his notebook.

Data? You mean the numbers on the jars?

Does that mean he's been
collecting them since 1983?

For the last fifteen years?

Thumb | Index Finger | Middle Finger | Ring Finger | Pinky

Gah! He recorded every
finger! He's so detailed!

[Years that my nails grew more than 30cm]
Right Hand Measurements

Does this mean that in 1983, his thumbnail on

his right hand grew 31.5 centimeters?

1983 was the year Reimi Sugimoto was killed.

The records begin in that year.

He probably reached the point

where he couldn't contain his
murderous instincts any longer.

Whoa! He's got his toenail
lengths on the next page!

I guess we've discovered the odd hobby

of a man who tried to convince
others that he was boring.

Look.

Years that my nails grow more than 30 cm
I'm on a roll!!
No one can stop me.

This data is fortune-telling.

Jewish merchants observe
the movement of sunspots

to determine how well
their businesses would do.

It appears Yoshikage Kira
used the length of his nails

to determine the condition he was in...

Whether he was in condition to kill, of course.

1999!

As of June, they've already grown
more than 20 centimeters this year!

He's insane, that sick bastard!

But this isn't a clue we can use to track him.

There might be something else.

Does this mean someone
else is in this house?

It would appear so.
Josuke, stay on your toes.

Does that mean he's working
with someone else?

No... That's not possible.

Crimes can be traced from
interactions with others.

A partner could possibly rat him out.

He's not the type to trust anyone.

This is...

Jotaro, look at that camera.

I-It's his father... Kira's father!

He's in the picture, right behind us!

But...

This is not good. This is so not good.

Does that mean he's a ghost?

Yeah. Considering the case of Reimi Sugimoto,

it's possible that his father
also couldn't pass on

to the next world and is stuck
here as a soul's energy.

Look at his expression.

He looks like he wants us to get the hell out.

Number Withheld   Public

Are you trying to scare us
with your ghost energy?

But this is all the more reason we can't leave.

Hurry up and answer the phone, you slowpoke!

I'm making it ring!

You think I look like I want you to leave?

It's the opposite, you moron!

My face is saying that I'm never
letting you leave this house!

Anyone who goes after my son must die.

You bastard! You know
about your son's crimes?

Hey, is something wrong?
What's all the racket?

Where are you hiding?

Get out here, you geezer ghost!

Ghost?!

Josuke, he's not hiding.

Huh?

It appears Kira's father has
been present from the start.

Look.

Boom

Wha... When did he...

He's moving around in the picture.

He's calling us from inside the picture.

He probably threw the receiver
from within this picture, too.

I'll kill you...

I'll kill anyone who goes
after my precious son!

Josuke!

We can attack ghosts with our Stands!

Rohan-sensei used his Heaven's Door
to read Reimi's memories!

Bastard!

Take this!

What?!

D-Damn!

Any damage to the photograph
will come back to us!

Hurry up and fix it, Josuke!

We're going to blow to pieces!

Josuke! Jotaro!

That power... I see!

You two have

the same kind of power that my son has!

Okuyasu, you're up!

Use The Hand to cut just
the old man out of the picture!

Gotcha! Leave it to me, Josuke!

Huh?

O-Okuyasu?

Wh-What the?!

Why did I run straight into the window?

M-My hands are coming out
all the way over there!

I can't come past this point!

That's...

A-A wall!

There's a wall here that we can't see!

It won't break! I-It can't be!

You finally figured it out?

That's the frame of the photo!

It may look like you're in the
room, but you're actually not.

I'm a ghost that lives within a photograph...

I can control the dimension of
any photograph that I appear in.

Because I can trap the energy of others'
souls in photos, using the camera!

That is my power!

That room is inside the picture!

If you damage the photo,
your soul's energy will be hurt,

and the damage will come
back to you, as well!

Inside the picture?
But it's right in front of me!

If you're as dumb as you look,
you don't need to think about it too hard.

After I kill these two, I'll trap
the two of you and slice you up!

J-Josuke! Jotaro!

I'll kill you...

You bastard! Stop, damn it!

Jotaro, what are you doing?

Do something with your
invincible Star Platinum!

Josuke... I'm giving up.

Huh?

It appears impossible to stop
the old geezer's attacks.

If all the damage is just
going to come back to us,

then even if I stop time with Star Platinum,
we won't be able to do anything.

When something's useless, I give up.

What did you say, Jotaro?

What the hell are you talking about?!

I'll kill you!

Your heads went flying!

A-A knife...

What?!

I can't touch it! J-Jotaro!

I've given up on stopping the geezer,

but...

Wha?

If he controls any photograph he's in,

then maybe all we have to do is take a
picture of him by himself, so he's alone.

What?!

To think you've evaded my attack... Damn it!

Josuke, say something to him.

Something cool. Let him have it!

Y-You didn't scare me at all, you idiot!

The

The Ha

The Han

The Hand

Oku

Okuyasu

Okuyasu Niji

Okuyasu Nijimura

Damn you!

You guys are clearly used to fighting.

You must have fought against
people with the same kind

of power as my son many, many times!

He can get out, since he's a ghost.

We need to make sure you
stay in there and keep quiet.

There's something in this house that will
cause him a lot of trouble if we find it.

That's why you attacked us.

I get it.

So if you fold him in half, there's no exit.

He can't run away.

Okuyasu, Koichi, you two search this room.

We'll search the right side.

I can't protect my son now! Damn it!

If that falls into their hands...

Still, what thing that might cause
trouble for him should we look for?

I'm not thinking too much about it.

If Kira's old man there turns pale,
it's a good sign.

I-I can't breathe...

I-It's too cramped...
Please, just a little is fine.

Just open the tiniest of holes
in the tape and let me breathe...

Y-You really can't breathe?

Hey, Koichi, he's just acting.

He's trying to get you to
open a hole so he can escape.

Y-You may not believe me,
b-but I really can't breathe!

I'm claustrophobic, so I
understand how that feels...

Oh, quit whining. You want us
to open up a hole that bad?

Fine, then. I'll open up plenty for you...

With tacks, that is.

Wh-What are you doing?!

Damn it! Let me out of here,
you stupid little brat!

Now you've shown your true colors.

I won't be removing those tacks.

Tacks? I can't see, but I appear
to be on the post right now.

I've got a great idea!

Your tacks helped me come up with
a trump card to get out of here!

It's easy! It's all thanks to you!

Well, see ya!

Wha...

Hey, you bastard...

What was that sound? What did you do?

Say something, damn it!

O-Okuyasu, this isn't good!
I think he might have run away!

Jotaro! H-He got away!

I-It's my fault. H-He used
the tacks and did something!

You've been fooled, you moron!

Looks like I've won the battle of wits.

What?!

Th-This is...

What's this doing here?

It can't be!

It's the bow and arrow...
But we retrieved them...

The bow and arrow should be in safekeeping
at the Speedwagon Foundation...

Is there another set?

Josuke, be careful! Kira's father escaped!

What?!

This arrow drew Deadly Queen out of Yoshikage!

The arrow is the important part!

I'll never let you have it!

R-Reverb, Koichi! Use Act 1 to go after it!

I-It's too far away!

Seriously?

The thing that Kira's father didn't want
us to find was the bow and arrow!

D-Damn it! It's all my fault!

No, Okuyasu. He was just a stronger opponent.

You can tell that Kira is definitely his son.

We've lost to that family's determination

to never give up, and to survive, no matter what.

As long as they don't get
this arrow, that's good enough.

I'm going to use this to
make more enemies for you!

The bow and arrow, huh... I see.

I thought there might be more than one set.

Now I know exactly how DIO and the others

were able to gather so many Stand
users in such a short amount of time.

They created more of them around the world

with a number of those bows and arrows.

I'm assuming Kira's father got this set
from an old woman named Enyaba,

and eventually, Okuyasu's brother, Keicho,

also got hold of one, and came to this town.

Because Stand users attract
other Stand users, apparently.

Yoshikage, where are you right now?

You never could help but kill women,
even when you were a boy.

But if that's what brings you
happiness, I'll protect you.

Because...

You're my one and only son.

Kitty!

Why?

Were you crying all night at the top of
that tree because you couldn't get in?

Hey! What gives you the right to
shut the window near the tree?!

I've told you day after day not to shut it!

What's wrong, kitty?
Why are you so worked up?

Cats hate water.

I'm sorry about that.
I shut the window without thinking.

I won't do it again.

Something's wrong. He's changed somehow.

He started cooking out
of the blue last night,

and he's using an actual blade rather
than an electric razor to shave.

Blades always give him razor burn...

Hey, you haven't paid your
rent from last month.

It's now 260,000 yen including this month's.

Pay up right now!

Rent?

You heard him. Hurry up and
bring it from the safe.

Safe?

Hurry! You're the only one who
knows the combination to the safe!

Hey, what are you...

Thank you for coming so
early in the morning, sir.

But I seem to be a bit
short on cash right now.

Huh?

Quit screwing around!

You got in over your head when

you tried to rent my wonderful house
with your lousy income, you peon!

You need to learn to live within your means!

Um, we'll get it right away—

No. Please don't get the wrong idea.

When I said I was a bit short, look.

I meant that I only had a
little over 500,000 yen.

I'll only be able to pay for this month,

last month, and the next
two months in advance.

Will that suffice?

Y-Yes, that's plenty.

Thank you very much.

Pleasure doing business with you!

Y-You...

You must have stolen that
money from the landlord.

I don't know how you did it,

but you stole it from his bag, didn't you?

I'm sure in most cases,

people would fear him and
think that he's just a low-life...

But my husband's actions...
him stealing that...

For the first time,
after years of living with him,

I think he's so romantic...

Janken Boy Is Coming!

Episode 26
Janken Boy Is Coming!The old woman in Egypt, Enyaba, told me

to shoot the arrow at those it desires.

They will become allies.

Those shot with the arrow

will be able to bring out just one
special power hidden in their hearts.

I believe she called them Stands.

Jotaro Kujo and the others...

If there are others in Morioh
who are after my Yoshikage,

then I need to make more
Stand users, more allies.

Now, arrow! Who do you want?

Choose! Choose them!

Pull

A telephone pole?

How is the telephone pole relev—

Could it be... you want that child?

Are you saying that child will be my ally?

V-Very well.

I just have to shoot that child, right?

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable

Episode 26      Janken Boy Is Coming!

Well, if it isn't the manga artist, Rohan Kishibe.

Good morning, Mr. Joestar.

What are you shooting here?

I was sneaking some photos of
businessmen heading to work.

If Yoshikage Kira switched places
with someone at Salon Cinderella,

he should be going to work every
day, just like that person did.

Going to work...

Knowing he's a man between
the ages of 25 and 35

who's around 175 centimeters
tall and an office worker

narrows it down quite a bit.

I see...

But you can't be sure that he uses the station.

He might drive to work in a car.

That is possible.

But he only changed his face.

I don't think it's possible to change
completely into someone else.

I'm pretty sure that the family of
one of these men is already

starting to think he's acting bizarre.

What worries me is that,
if the family finds Kira out,

there's a possibility Kira will
get rid of that family.

I'm not trying to preach justice or anything,

but I just want to find
Kira before that happens.

Hey!

Mister, would you play janken with me?

Janken...

Hey, come on. It wouldn't
hurt to play, would it?

What's with this kid?

Janken...

There's always at least one
weirdo at any station.

Anyway, if you find any clues,
please let me know, Mr. Joestar.

And you make sure you don't meddle
in anything dangerous alone.

Hey, Mister. You're the
manga artist guy, right?

Didn't your series take a break not long ago?

I read Shonen Jump weekly.

So come on. It wouldn't
hurt to play janken with me.

What's with you? Beat it!

I wanna play janken. Come on, please?

What's with this kid? He has a hole in his cheek!

I-It's deep.

Hey, come on! Hey, hey!

Does it go all the way into his mouth?

No hard feelings if you lose.

If we tie, we play again.
If you shoot too late, you lose.

Got it? Ready, and...

Janken...

This brat is being oddly persistent.

Is he a Stand user?

Ready, and... Janken...

Heaven's Door!

Hmph.

Let's see...

His name is Ken Oyanagi, and he's eleven.

There's nothing about a Stand written here...

And it says the hole in his cheek was
from falling off a telephone pole.

Loves "janken."
Really wants to play "janken."
Plays "scissors" first.

It looks like this kid really wants to play janken.

It's stupid, but...

Hey, guys. Are you getting in or not?

Would you mind waiting about 30 seconds?

Here we go.

Yeah, all right. You just
want me to play, right?

Janken... hoi!

Well, see ya.

I... I lost...

I guess that's enough work for today.

Yo, Rohan-sensei.

Are you done with work already?

Why don't you sit down and chat for a bit?

It's the shitbag Josuke, the idiot Okuyasu...

And the moody Yukako.

All people with whom I have
nothing to talk about.

Sorry, but I'm still working. Some other time.

I see...

Hey, what are you doing? That's my seat.

You haven't sat down yet, have you?

This seat was empty, so I sat down.

Whoops.

What's with you? Why do you keep bugging me?

Let's use janken to decide
who gets the seat. Okay?

Again?!

No! I sat here first!

This seat belongs to me!

Sir...

Hang on...

Rohan-sensei, just let him have it.

He's just a kid.

Don't make him cry.
That's pretty immature of you.

Why don't you sit next to him?

Shut up! All of you, shut your mouths!

Fine! I'll play janken!

Janken's what you want, right?

That's the spirit! H-Here we go!

Janken... hoi!

Oh? Y-Yes, I won!

Take that!

I've never been so happy to
win at janken in my life.

So immature...

No, winning against a brat
is the best feeling there is.

D-Damn it!

I can use this as reference material.

Who knew a book on such a minor
subject was being sold in Morioh?

7,500 yen, huh...

Do I have that much on me?

Excuse me, can I get this book?

Why, you little...

Wanna decide with janken?

Fine!

Here we go! Janken...

Rock!

Stop messing around!

I won. See?

I finally won!

One win, two losses!

What the hell is this?!

Wh—

What?!

I-Impossible! Th-The hole...

Could he be a Stand user?!

What?!

S-So cool!

I didn't know something
so cool would come out!

Beautiful and magnificent
energy is flowing into me!

I'm feeling better!

H-Heaven's Door!

Make this kid into a book!

Open

Cannot attack Rohan Kishibe.

This kid...

seemed to be bringing out his
own Stand for the first time.

Could he be on his way to becoming a Stand user?

Hmph. "I want to beat the crap
out of Rohan with janken," huh?

"Janken is not about probability.

It's all mental, dependent on
how much you want to win.

Beating Rohan at janken means
you've beaten him mentally.

Rohan Kishibe is only 20 years old,
and he's already facing the world alone.

Not to mention, he's awed
many people with his works.

If I beat the crap out of someone so widely
admired, it means I'd surpass them.

I want to grow up to be someone
people admire, just like Rohan."

So this kid really is on his way
to becoming a Stand user!

He must have only just been hit by the arrow.

"Ability... When I beat my opponent
in janken, their energy becomes mine.

However, we have to play five times.

If I don't win three times, I can't take all of it."

Play five times?

Cannot attack Rohan Kishibe.

attack Rohan Kishibe.

attack Rohan Kishibe.

Can attack Rohan Kishibe.

Wh-What?

That's so cool. So this
ability is called a "Stand"?

You may have thought you got away,

but I've already absorbed
one third of your Stand.

I-Its right arm is missing!

I can move one third of Heaven's Door!

I won't let you read my mind anymore.

You brat...

If I win two more times,
all of your ability will be mine!

You brat! Who do you think you are?!

You had some nerve to hit
me with your fist earlier.

That's payback, you moron!

It appears that in order to get
Heaven's Door's right arm back,

I'll have to win at janken...

Very well.

Good!

Do you understand the situation you're in?

You can't lose again.

Do you understand that you're cornered?

Now that I know you're a Stand user,
I won't hold back anymore!

As soon as I get back my right arm,

I'm going to knock you out.

You know that, don't you?

Are you trying to pressure me?

All right, let's do this.

No, we're not doing that yet.

Since I just won using paper,

I would usually go with rock or scissors next,

but I think that might be childish.

But you don't seem that
simple-minded, Rohan-sensei,

so I was thinking about turning that
around and going with paper.

All right, I've got it.

Here we go!

Janken... hoi!

What?!

I did it! I forced my hand against
Rohan mentally, and won with paper!

Now I've got two wins and two losses.

Now, then...

I took your lower half.

If you're tired, should we
head over to the bench?

No, there's no need.

When you win, it's best to be

looking down on your opponent just like this.

I've got two wins and two losses,

which means we're both on the edge.

But you know, I really don't feel
like I'm going to lose now.

After I lost twice at first,
I won twice in a row.

You're the opposite, Rohan-sensei.
You've lost twice in a row.

You're currently on the
downhill slope in this match!

This is amazing!

No wonder the arrow picked this kid!

If this kid is able to obtain
Rohan Kishibe's ability

to read minds, we'll be invincible!

It'll help out my Yoshikage.

You brat...

It seems you've gotten better
at pressuring your opponent.

It's the truth that you've lost twice in a row.

The truth, huh... Indeed.

In that case, let me give
you a dose of truth, as well.

In our next match, you will
definitely not use paper.

I'm not so sure about that.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hold it.

I used rock twice in a row and lost.

Which means that rock is the
unluckiest choice for me.

Am I wrong?

It's only natural that I wouldn't be able
to use the unlucky rock a third time.

Since you said I was on a downhill slope,

you won't be able to use paper.

If you use paper, it's like admitting
that I am actually not going downhill.

I'll force my hand and beat you!

Let's go, Rohan Kishibe!

It's on!

Jan...

...ken...

...hoi!

After all that pressure, he still used paper.

His mental strength is remarkable.

There's no way I'll lose!

I definitely still have the
upper hand in this match!

I'll use paper four times in a row!
I'm gonna force my hand!

All right! Rock! I'll get the
unlucky rock on my side!

One more...

Th-The strength in my knees...

What? He's using a different
form than before!

The only one Rohan hasn't
used yet is scissors...

Crap... Going with paper again is dangerous!

Crap!

I guess rock wasn't unlucky after all!

Damn that Rohan!

Th-That's...

Hey, Mister!

Hey, Rohan-sensei. Those two are
probably Stand users, too, right?

They are, right? I can feel it.

Let's test my luck.

If I'm out of luck,
those two will come over here.

If I'm protected by strong luck,
they definitely won't come over here.

Hey, that's Rohan.

Hey! Hey!

I really hate that guy.

Let's just smile and walk away.

Hmm... Well, hmm...

Menacing

That child...

Menacing

I do believe he's...

a fan of his.

See you later.

See ya.

It looks like strong luck is
on my side, Rohan-sensei.

I feel like there's no way I can lose right now,

because I'm protected by strong luck!

Right now, I feel like I could
survive Russian roulette

with five out of six bullets in the chamber!

Crash

It's a shower of glass!

Now, let's have our final match
to see who'll win, Rohan-sensei!

What are you doing?

Hurry up and get into your janken pose.

You're the one who needs to
hurry up and get started.

I'm going to go with this.

Stop messing around.

No, I'm dead serious.

You said you were going to surpass me,

but since I've lived nine years longer
than you, I'll let you in on something...

It's not very hard to make others lose.

The most difficult thing is...
Listen carefully, now...

The most difficult thing is

to surpass yourself!

I'm now going to surpass my own luck!

Let's go, Rohan!

It's on!

Janken hoi!

Yes! How's that, Rohan Kishibe?!

Wh-What?

What?!

Huh?

Wh-What the?

Why is my hand shaped as rock?!

Now I have three wins and two losses.

You have the unlucky rock.

Strong luck came to me a moment ago,
along with Joseph Joestar.

The Invisible Baby.

Huh?!

Will save Rohan when he's in danger.
Will become invisible and make the kid's hand into "rock."

You only relied on your strong
luck, and I changed my luck.

That's what it means to surpass yourself.

Boom

Now, then. I'm going to knock
you out now, as I promised.

I'll write,

"You'll never be able to win at janken again.

Your Stand will be destroyed."

Sh-Shut up!

Stay away from me, Rohan!

O-Otherwise, this baby's gonna...

Do you understand what you're doing?

Hmph! Right now, our match
is a verbal argument!

You haven't really won against me!

You won because you cheated, you coward!

Let the baby go.

Fight me one more time!

Then I won't do anything to this baby.

And I'm telling you to let the baby go.

I'll fight you.

I'll make you lose! Janken, hoi! Hoi! Hoi!

I-I-I can't win!

D-Damn it! I made you into a
Stand user and you still lost!

See ya!

You won't die.

I'm just going to destroy your Stand.

If...

If I have to obey what you write...

If I'm going to be mentally controlled by you...

I'd rather die like this!

Take that, Rohan Kishibe!

Pfft

Nice. I like you, kid.

I feel moved when I see people who are...

Dash

dramatic like you!

Wha?!

Y-You'll be run over, too!

You think so?

What the? Th-The wind!

Whoa, what the hell is this picture?!

I-I can't see in front of me!

I-It avoided us and drove by?

Y-You could have died, too,
but you did that for me...

Was it strong luck?

You've become quite impressive
in such a short time.

I won't knock you out.

However, don't use that
Stand for evil anymore.

I carelessly bumped into it, damn it!

I lost. I've completely lost.

Hey, Rohan!

D-Did you see the baby?

She's missing, Sensei!

N-No, it might be that we just can't see her.

C-Crap...

She's gone.

Hey, where are you?

I'll just pretend I don't know
and look with them...

Wh-Where did you go? Where are you?

Janken Kid. Real name: Ken Oyanagi.

Hey!

Stand name: Boys Man Man.

Unable to fight.

For some reason, the hole
in his cheek is still there.

Profile
Yoshikage Kira

It appears he's done a good job of disposing
of all evidence of his crimes up to now.

Yoshikage Kira...

What do you look like now,
and what is your name?

Where are you?

Summer...

There are many more tourists around town now.

Yeah...

I doubt that he'll be able to stay put.

I'm sure he won't be able
to resist making a move.

The summer season is finally upon us.

On July 1st, the beach and rivers in
Morioh were opened to the public.

There are hordes of tourists
from the capital and S City,

making the town even livelier.

Relaxing at a summer villa,
camping, fishing, yachting...

There are many fun activities
to find here this time of year!

How are you all going
to enjoy your summer?

Yes, many fun things...

I'm sure he has

many fun things to do, too.

People live while hiding what's
deep in their hearts from others.

But...

Is there anyone who has

been able to hide their true
self from others forever?

Damn it!

I want to show that woman
the true Yoshikage Kira.

I want her to hear how
I feel deep down inside...

That I want to take your
slender neck into these hands

and strangle you to death.

When my nails are growing,
I become unable to suppress my urges.

I just need to be patient until it subsides.

I'm still not able to perfectly
mimic his handwriting.

Josuke Higashikata... Jotaro Kujo...

It's because of them that I'm in this mess.

Um...

Uh... What... are you doing?

O-Of course. It should be obvious.

You were reading a book.

Um, I poured some tea for you.

I know you probably think that's rare,

b-but if you'd like some...

If you don't want it, that's fine, too...

Oh, look at the time.

I think I'll go to bed...

Open up your heart to that woman.

Show her your true self,

Yoshikage Kira.

D-Darling?

Crap. Opening up is a bad idea.

They'll find out.

I'm sorry I startled you.

H-He was trying to undo
the buttons in the back?

"I'm sorry I startled you"?

Not at all! All of your actions lately

have been exciting me to no end!

And they make me feel thrilled! I...

I've fallen

in love with you.

J-Josuke, l-look over there.

What the heck is—

Is this... Could this be...

T-Terri Funk—

It's a crop circle!

Yeah! A crop circle!

Th-That's amazing!

I can't believe one of these
showed up in a field in Morioh!

Something's not right, Okuyasu.

Take a closer look at the middle of that thing.

Something's really wrong here!

You're gonna go in?

We don't have a choice!

Be careful.

Yeah.

I-Is he alive?

He's got a scratch on the back of his neck,

but I think he's just unconscious.

Hey, wake up. Are you all right? Hey!

I've never seen him at our school.

Oh, looks like he's awake.

Where...

Where am I?

Where?

You're right in the middle of
a field in Budogaoka, Morioh.

Is this Earth?

Last night, I suddenly felt ill.

I then lost consciousness, it would seem.

It's past eight, so I was unconscious
for thirteen Earth hours.

He totally tried to pull one over us!

Damn! I can't believe you tried
to pull such an elaborate prank!

Man, you sure got me!

You're a really funny guy!

So you made a crop circle and waited

under the grass until someone came by?

Amazing! That's amazing!

I can't breathe! My stomach hurts!

Stomach Medicine

That's so stupid!

What school do you go to?

School?
We love guys like you!

My planet is in the Magellanic Clouds,
but it has been destroyed.

I came to Earth to find out

if it's a suitable place to live,
and if the people are nice.

That's enough of that.
If you take the joke too far,

you're going to ruin your own brilliant idea.

Here, have a tissue.

Thank you. That was quite delicious.

W-We should really get to school.

Y-Yeah, you're right.

Let's go.

That guy ate the tissue.

He's a guy who takes jokes too far.

The ice cream shop's closed!

And it's our only comfort on Monday mornings...

It can't be helped.

Let's give up for today.

Would you like some ice cream?

Well? Do you want some?

Yeah, but the shop's closed,
so there's nothing we can do.

There's no reason for you to give up.

I just happen to have two.

We can call it a trade for the tissue earlier.

Earth seems like a very nice place to live.

It's cold...

Wh-Why did you have
ice cream cones in your bag?

Are those ice cream cones not good enough?

That's not what I'm asking!
Who the hell are you?

I believe I told you that moments ago...

Ah! You want to hear me introduce myself?

It must have slipped my mind.

My name is Nu Mikitakazo Nshi.

I am 216 years old.

My occupation is a spaceship pilot.

My hobby is having pets.

I'm even currently carrying
a house mouse in my bag.

It is very happy when I pet its back.

This guy's a Stand user.
There's no doubt about it.

Let's kick his ass, Josuke!

Calm down, Okuyasu.

Do you really think a Stand user

would say that he's from
the Magellanic Clouds?

Th-Then what the hell is with him?

There, there, there.

I have no idea.

We're gonna have to investigate.

Don't eat that ice cream.

Huh?!

So you're 216, you say?

Yes.

Hmm...

Hmm...

And your occupation is a spaceship pilot?

Why do you keep copying me?

So, what?

Are you trying to say that you're an alien?

An alien!

An alien! Yes!

I should have used that word to begin with.

I'm an alien.

Hey, hey, hey, hey...

Then, like, your... flying saucer?

Could you call over your spaceship?

You can, right?

Of course.

But, sadly, as it is currently on standby
in space, 1,500,000 kilometers away,

it would take about three days.

I can't bring it immediately.

Are you going to call it
with that watch of yours?

Oh, how did you know?

But this is a secret between us.

Please don't tell anyone of this.

This guy is totally messed up in the head.

He wasn't joking earlier at all.

He's a delusional, crazy bastard.

Should I punch him?

You always want to throw punches first.

Let's take it a bit further, just to be sure.

Do you have, like, a ray gun and, like,

an ultra hyper anti-gravity
device in your bag?

Of course I do.

But I didn't come to Earth to fight,
so I left them in my spaceship.

Aw, come on. If you're an
alien, show us something.

And your blood wasn't even green.

Yeah. Alien blood is always green.

Do you two doubt me?

Hey, calm down.

You finally got it? You moron!

I don't mind going along with pranks,

but I don't have time to deal
with delusional freaks like you.

You didn't have to just come out and say that!

Shut up! It's better to be up-front!

What? Is there a fire somewhere?

Wh-What the hell?

This sound... I don't like this sound.

This sound...

Stop this sound!

I don't like this sound!

I'm allergic to it!

Make it stop!

Josuke, this guy's dangerous!

Let's go. We shouldn't mess with him.

But don't you think

leaving him like that is a bit cruel?

He said he's allergic to that sound,
right? Just leave him be.

I'm leaving, Josuke.

H-Hey!

Damn it, Okuyasu.

H-Hey, you okay?

No... Please,

take me somewhere I can't hear this sound...

Wh-What?!

Please take me away!

A-Are you actually...

I have a power that allows
me to turn into anything.

H-Hurry... I feel like my head
will split open amidst this sound...

Please...

I'll turn into sneakers, so please,
wear them and take me with you!

In return, I'll do anything for you!

Are you a Stand user?!

Whoa! Y-You're super fast!

With your powers plus my powers,

our speed and jumping strength are doubled.

Are you seriously an alien?!

You're rather persistent, aren't you?

I told you earlier that I was an alien...

Hang on a sec.

L-Let me sort this out in my head.

Anyway, you saved me by
taking me away from that.

The people on my planet can't
stand the sound of sirens.

It's a wavelength that aggravates our nerves.

I'd like to do something for you
to thank you for saving me.

Shall I turn into a fan and fan you?

Or maybe a back scratcher
so I can scratch your back?

Whoa, it's not like I saved you because
I wanted something in return...

You'll really do anything?
Please! Do it! Thank you!

What would you like me to do?

C-Can you turn into anything?

Like something light, or multiple
numbers of something?

Yes. I can turn into almost anything.

However, I cannot turn
into complicated machinery

or anything more powerful than me.

I see, I see. Got it. I like you!

So you're going to thank me, right?

Yes.

I-I...

just had a brilliant idea.

It's an idea that'll make everyone happy.

Happy?

Yeah!

See, I managed to make some
money from a lottery ticket,

but my mom found out and
froze the account I put it in.

Once she finds something like that,
there's no convincing her.

It sucks not having any
money for the summer season.

Shopping

And so...

Can you turn into this? This thing.

What is that?

They're dice!

I'll make some money using these,

then I'll split it with you,
and everyone will be happy!

What do you do with those?

Huh? You don't know what dice are?

I-I'm sorry...

You don't have to apologize.

It's really easy. I'll show you.

These are tools that people
who like games really love.

They're hard, and they have six sides.

This divot represents the number one,
and it has them from one through six.

Ah, yes. I think I'm starting to understand.

So when there are five divots,
it's the number five, right?

Well done, alien!

And three divots represent a three.

Yes! Try turning into one.

Understood.

That was simple.

What are you talking about?
You're way too big.

You're only supposed to be about this big.

Also, you've got five on two sides.

The numbers on a die are from one through six.

The numbers on one side and its
opposite side should equal seven.

Oh, pardon me.

How about this?

Th-That tickles!

Hey, don't laugh. Dice don't talk.

Huh?

Come on.

I-I'll do my best.

I'm a bit nervous about this, but...

Yes, you're good! Very good! This is perfect!

I'm getting excited!

Rohan Kishibe, I hope you have
some money waiting for me!

I-I can't breathe...

Oh, look who it is.

What does Josuke Higashikata want with me?

This is a rare occurrence.

Did you get more information concerning Kira?

No, not exactly...

Um, well...

Are you done with work today?

I was wondering if I could have
a peek at your next chapter...

What are you plotting?

Just spit it out.

D-Damn...

I can't hide anything from you, Rohan-sensei.

All right, I'll tell you the truth.

Please! Play Cee-lo with me!

Cee-lo?

To be perfectly honest,

I have no spending money for the summer.

Well, I have 30,000 yen.
It's my life savings.

But...

Nowadays, 30,000 yen is gone
after you make one or two trips

to an amusement park and get some food.

So all that's left is to make
more money, or go flat broke.

Wagering on the thrill!

Isn't that what youth is all about?

That's what I think! Don't you agree?!

Look, I'll be straight with you.
I've always disliked you.

So why should I have to play Cee-lo with you?

Yeah, you're right.

I'm sure you're not hurting for spending money,

so you have no reason to play.

But... All right.

Huh?! You'll do it?

I don't dislike games, and this seems fun.

Come around to the back.

Thank you, Rohan-sensei.

The shooter rolls 3 dice into the bowl
This will result in paying double
This will result in winning double
The larger number wins (here, the 6)

Do these rules work for you?

No arguments here.

Chips cost 1,000 yen each.

And when you roll the
three dice into the bowl,

if even one spills out,
you lose then and there.

Got it.

All right. Let's tape the rules up here.

Okay, let's do this!

Wait.

We won't be using your dice.

Huh?!

We'll be playing with these
dice I had in the house.

U-Um, is there something wrong with my dice?

No idea. There's just something
that I don't like about them.

And...

I did say this seemed fun,
but I wasn't talking about Cee-lo.

I meant that it'd be fun taking
your 30,000 yen from you.

When you lose, you'd better pay up for real.

It doesn't matter how well
acquainted we are, Josuke-kun.

Yes! Those dice are the ones
that the alien turned into!

I snuck them into your house ahead of time!

I'm such a villain.

It won't be much, but I'll be making
some money off of you, Rohan-sensei.

Now, let's roll to see who goes first.

I rolled a four.

Yes!

All right, you go first. Go ahead and roll.

Ow!

O...

O-Ow! I accidentally hit the table.

Hurry up and bet and roll your dice.

R-Right...

I-I'll start off with two, I think,
so that'll be 2,000 yen.

Okay, here's two.

If I roll a one, a two, and a three,
I'll have to pay double,

so I really need to make sure
I don't get one, two, and three.

Better not get a one, two, and three!
Not a one, two, and three!

I-I'll go really lightly on the first roll.

Just to test the waters...

Here we go... Lightly.

How's that?!

Huh?!

What?

A-An omen...

What?

Triple sixes, AKA "omen."

Josuke wins five times what
he wagered from Rohan.

S-Stupid! You're not supposed
to start off with that!

E-Er, I mean...

I meant that was some stupid luck!

A triple six, meaning you have
to pay five times my bet...

It almost seems like I'm cheating!

Hmph. It seems you've already earned
10,000 yen in spending money.

Let's continue the game.
I can't believe my luck myself...

It's my turn next.

I want to get back what I just lost, so I'm...

going with ten.

Ten?

All right! Go!

One, two, and three. The wager is doubled!

The shooter rolls 3 dice into the bowl
This will result in paying double

Rohan has to pay Josuke double what he wagered.

This is too much! This is way too much!

Does that alien not know
what "holding back" means?

Crap... He's totally suspicious of me!

Don't move an inch.

What's he going to do?

If Rohan finds out that I've been
using that alien to cheat...

Knowing him,

just apologizing is definitely
not going to cut it.

What are you checking?

I could be imagining it, but I feel
like the dice are staring at me.

Gulp.

Ba-dum, ba-dum...

Hmph. Well, whatever.
Let's continue the game.

Rohan... Adds 30 New Chips

W-Well, then... I'll go easy and just bet two.

You get it now, right, Alien?

I need to just manage to win.

I just need to be a tiny bit ahead in the end.

All right, go!

H-He doesn't get it!

I guess what happens twice is
bound to happen a third time.

I suppose it's possible to
roll this more than once.

An omen is worth five times the bet, yes?

I'll pay up.

That's what came up, so it can't be helped.

Right... I guess things that happen
twice can happen a third time.

Wh-Wh-Wha...

What the hell are you doing?!

I'm not sure how, but I
know that you're cheating.

That's unforgivable...

It's unforgivable that I can't figure it out!

Dude, you're messed up in the head!

You're infuriating.

Up until now, I've held back
my anger toward you

for Mr. Joestar and Koichi's sakes,

but you are currently trying
to make a fool of me.

Just thinking about you laughing
deep down inside is unbearable.

Let me see your hand.
I'll have Shining Diamond fix it.

Shut up!

Do you know why I did that to my pinky?

So that you won't be able to forfeit
the game, Josuke Higashikata!

I won't let a doofus like you
underestimate the great Rohan!

We'll both just play one more time.

In that time, I swear I will
figure out how you're cheating.

If I am unable to determine
how you're cheating...

There's two million yen there.

I'll use that to ask you to fix
my pinky with Shining Diamond.

However, if I figure out how you're cheating,

I'm going to take your
pinky, Josuke Higashikata.

Hey, you two look like you're having fun.

Hey, it's me. Been a while, Josuke!

I was stuck in the hospital for a month.

I don't really remember how,

but apparently I hurt my
head on the side of the road.

Tamami?

What the hell are you doing here?

I called him earlier and asked
him to act as an official.

An official?

I'm Tamami Kobayashi.

I will make sure the contracted promise
is promptly and surely collected,

using this lock that attaches to your heart.

I will work fairly, no matter
who wins or who is involved.

I charge 20%, or 400,000 yen,
whichever sum is larger.

You will both play one more time

and see if you can figure out
the cheat or not, correct?

Yeah.

What?!

However, you can also get
out of this by not cheating,

so I will ensure that doesn't happen.

Should you win without cheating,

I will create a rule where Tamami's
lock will automatically attack you.

This really isn't good... But I have to do this!

I have to keep the cheat going to
the end and break through this!

Well, then... I'll go first.

How's that?!

A four!

A pair of three's and a four!

Yes! That throw ended up
being normal "naturally."

Now he won't find out.

I-It's my turn next, right?

Hmph. You look rather relieved.

It's as though something you
asked someone to do went well.

Don't get rattled. Rohan hasn't figured it out.

I'm just going to keep playing!

H-He threw up?!

C-Crap! He's getting dizzy!

It's because Rohan shook him around so much.

Josuke! Don't you dare hide
the dice with your hand.

Huh?

I can't see them.

You need to throw the dice so I can see them.

Huh? I wonder if there's a fire somewhere.

Wh-What? Sirens?!

Th-This guy's allergic to sirens.

Crap! He's going to turn back!

What are you doing? You're being suspicious!

Show me what's in your hand at once!

Sorry so sudden, but that was
a yell to get me hyped up!

I'll throw now!

Go! Do it!

It's a 666 omen!

The lock didn't move. Josuke is cheating!

Well? Did you figure it out, Rohan-sensei?

Or are you admitting defeat, Rohan-sensei?

Looks like the rash isn't
showing up on Rohan's side.

Please hang in there!

Did you figure it out or not?

I'm done for...

That's... I've got it!

He knows!

I've got it! The fire's here!

Huh?!

Rohan-sensei, your house is on fire!

It's the magnifying glass!

The magnifying glass caused the fire!

We were too busy with
the game to even notice!

Shut up! I don't care if my house is burning!

It's more important that I figure
out how Josuke is cheating!

What are you talking about?!

You have to get out of here,
and take your two million!

W-Well, I'll be going now...

Wait, Josuke!

But first, I'm going to fix your pinky.

No one asked you to do that!

Josuke, wait! You bastard!

That was close... But I guess I have a way
of making people resent me, huh?

I had no idea.

You seem down.

Was I able to be of use to you?

Sh-Shut up, jeez!

Rohan Kishibe's House: 7,000,000 yen in fire damage

Now, all you drivers out there,
please be careful when driving.

It seems a motorcycle crashed at the
entrance of Futatsumori Tunnel yesterday,

and the young rider was badly injured.

Police later found out...

Lately, Mom's been acting strange.

She's been dressing up, she got new lipstick,

and she's in a good mood...

Did something happen?

It's been a while since Mom
got naked in front of Dad.

Am I a child that was born to
parents who loved each other?

What's he doing?

Josuke Higashikata... Jotaro Kujo...

It's their fault I'm in this mess.

Oh, Josuke-san. Thank you for yesterday.

Where did you sleep and eat
after what happened yesterday?

Mikitaka! Mikitaka!

You need to stay right behind me!

We just moved here,
so there's a lot we must do.

All right, Mother. I'll be right there.

H-Huh?

Don't tell me you're pulling
jokes on people again

by telling them you're an alien.

If he said that to you,
please don't think anything of it.

At his last school in Tokyo,
people took it seriously,

and there was a lot of trouble.

Now, if you'll excuse us.

Huh? What?!

I brainwashed her into
thinking that I'm her son.

The name "Mikitaka Hazekura"
is the name I'm using on Earth.

See ya!

Mikitaka! Come here this instant!

Mikitaka Hazekura...Alien or Stand User?!

H-Huh?

Huh?!

What was that?

What was with that brat?

Was he actually an alien?

Or was he a Stand user created
by this arrow when it hurt him?

The way he pulled Josuke and Rohan
Kishibe apart was very effective...

But!

Next time, the next Stand, Highway Go Go,

will defeat those who go after my son!

Why are you avoiding eye contact with me?

You should at least greet me.

After all, I am older than
you, Josuke Higashikata.

Sorry about yesterday.

Th-That fire must have been a lot of trouble.

Yes. About 2,500,000 yen worth
of furniture identical to

the furniture used in the movie
Pretty Woman was burned.

Not that I care in the least.

What's wrong? Sit down.

Someday, I will pay you back
for yesterday's dice game.

What?

That was...

Josuke, did you see that?

There was a door to a house in the tunnel wall.

There's someone inside!

There's a window, too!

There's a room in the tunnel wall.

A room that someone lives in!

There's a man, too!

But I can't see either of their faces!

What is he doing?!

Josuke, did you see that?!

Shut the hell up, Rohan Kishibe!

How long are you going
to try to mess with me?!

Can no one else see it?

Is that house... a new Stand user?

The man who cut off that woman's hand...

Could he be...

Yoshikage Kira?!

Morioh Landmark 8
"Futatsumori Tunnel"
Completed in year 5 of the Kaei
Period (1852). Fixed in year 28 of
the Showa Period. 450 meters in
length. Is on the road connecting
S City and Morioh. Because it is
curved inside, the exit is not visible
from the entrance. As there is very
little light, there are many
accidents, and since is it rather
creepy, it's considered haunted
by young people.

Futatsumori
Tunnel

There was a room inside the tunnel?!

You're not fooling me!

You want to get back at me by
telling me a stupid lie like that?

You don't believe me, Josuke Higashikata?

A liar like you who cheats with dice...

A liar like you who always does
something different from what he says,

has the nerve to call me a liar?

It appears we truly do not get along.

I guess you wouldn't understand,
even if you went back there with me.

All right, let's go.

That's the exit.

There was nothing there.

There was nothing here but a wall.

Maybe it really was an illusion.

What?!

Crash

Th-This is...

Th-The room I saw from the bus.

It appeared out of nowhere!

Though the man and woman
I saw earlier aren't here.

Crap! Something's there!

So this room was a trap after all!

It's coming... Something's there!

I can't see it, but something's coming at me!

Something came toward me.

I couldn't see it, but it came right toward me.

It was something not human.

That room was a trap.

The man that resembled
Kira was also an illusion.

Now I know that room is a Stand.

I can't handle it alone.
Should I tell Mr. Joestar about it?

What? It's chasing after me!

What is that?!

These... These things that
look like footprints...

Are they the Stand?

60km/h!

I managed to get away.

Apparently if I go faster than
60km/h, it can't keep up.

Is it being remotely controlled?

What?!

Crap! It caught up to me!

I only slowed down a little bit!

Th-This thing...

I'll turn it into a book and control it!

Heaven's Door!

Crap... It's sucking out my power...

I know I just said that I never
wanted to see Rohan again,

but here I am.

I'm a liar who always does something
different from what he says.

What?!

W-Wait... C-Could this be...

Rohan's motorcycle? Only the motorcycle?!

Smash

Th-That thing...

Give me nutrients...
Give me your nutrients!

Heaven's Door!

The Stand's name is Highway Go Go.

That room was a trap.

When a curious passer-by enters that room,

it'll go any distance to chase them down,

like a hunting dog on a scent,
then it sucks out their nutrients.

Once one is touched by
Highway Go Go, its weak spot...

Its weak spot...

d-doesn't exist?!

I-It's no use... I don't have any strength.

I can't read any more.

I-I'm losing more and more power...

I can't even write an order on him...

I can't...

Rohan!

Hey, are you here, Rohan?!

Josuke... I can't believe you came back...

A comrade...

Your name is Rohan?

Hey, Rohan! Answer me! Where are you?

Rohan!

Th-That's...

R-Rohan?!

Go on, Rohan... Ask him to save you.

What the hell is that room?
Call out for help.

Are you all right?!

I've left just a bit of your nutrients in you.

If you ask him for help,
I'll spare your life.

Because I'll take his nutrients instead.

Now... Help me lure him into this room.

I'll spare your life. Hurry up and call him.

What the hell is this room?

It almost looks as if someone lives in it!

Hurry up and say it.

Look! He's suspicious,
so he won't come any closer.

It's not like you two love each other, is it?

I told you to ask him for help.

Do you want to die?

I-If I lure him in here...

If I offer him up instead,

w-will you really...

spare my life?

Yeah, I promise.

It'll be a give-and-take in
exchange for his nutrients.

Call him. Hurry up and call him!

I refuse.

What?!

One of my absolute favorite things to do

is to tell someone who
thinks they're tough, "no."

Run, Josuke!

If you come into this room,
you have no chance!

You'll be killed!

You bastard!

Do you really think I'd run away

because someone told me to run away?

I'll kick his ass.

Where is he?

Where's the bastard hiding?

H—

How can you do this, Josuke Higashikata?

I even told you of the danger...

You always do the opposite
of what I think you'll do.

And that's why I hate you.

That's why you piss me off!
You're going to be attacked!

Now he's got your scent!

Smash Crush Smash

Yes! I got him!

Heaven's Door!

Your body will fly
backwards at 70km/h!

Josuke, Highway Go Go will
follow you anywhere at 60km/h!

Look for the user!

The only way for you to survive
is to defeat the user!

Shut up already, you idiot!

Rohan!

Rohan Kishibe...

To think that you'd actually save me...

It's... It's unbelievable, but I'm moved!

All right, Rohan.

I just have to find that thing's user, right?

I just need to find the user and kick his ass!

Wait for me, Rohan!

Episode 29
Highway Go Go, Part 2

Episode 29
Highway Go Go, Part 2I swear I'll save you,
so wait for me, Rohan!

So it learned my scent?

It's going to chase me forever,

and as soon as it touches me,
it'll suck out my nutrients?

Yes!

That thing can't go faster than 60km/h!

This bike'll have no problem beating that.

But how the hell am I
supposed to find the user?

I guess I'll sort out everything
I know about him first.

First, why did he set up
a trap inside the tunnel?

It would have been easier to
ambush us from the roadside.

Second, I think there's more
to his sucking out nutrients.

There's got to be a reason for that tunnel.

I've got to check out that tunnel!

I need information about
the Futatsumori Tunnel!

Koichi!

I need to call Koichi and have
him use Reverb to find the user!

Now, now. What's the matter? There, there...

All right. There should be plenty
of distance between us now.

Where's my card?

Y-You can't be serious!

Why'd it suddenly appear?

I ran away at 80km/h,
and it was going 60km/h.

Even doing simple math,

it should have taken another
two minutes to get here.

That thing is a Stand.

It can appear and disappear freely...

He managed to make it appear
somewhere near where I am,

and now it's going to accurately

attack me by following my scent!

S-Sixty kilometers...

Wh-What?!

Shit! A baby carriage!

What's the matter with you?
You're so fussy...

If I slow down, I'm gonna die.

Rohan will die, as well.

Sorry, but I'm gonna have to ride through.

I have to just bust through!

But, Shining Diamond!

Fix.

Good!

I'll never be able to make
a phone call like this!

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable

Episode 29     Highway Go Go, Part 2

Listen up, Yoshioka.

In one minute,

you will receive a very
important call on your phone.

This is a deal worth one billion!

You'd better not mess this up!

I'm counting on you, Yoshioka!

Y-Yes, sir! Please leave it to me.

This is it! This cell phone!

It just happened to show up
at the perfect time. Lucky me!

I will do my absolute best!

Talk about a silver lining!

Hello?

Huh?

Gah! One billion yen!

Did that happen when I grabbed it?

My silver lining just broke!

If you hate me, just hang up on me!

H-How can you say that, Minayo?

Say it! Ask her to marry you!

Minayo, will you m-marry—

Man, I think I might be lucky today.

Huh? What? What is it, Akira?

Talk about good timing!

Hello, Hirose residence.

Koichi!

So that's what's happening.

If I don't find the user,
I'm gonna get killed.

I think it's a guy who has some kind of

obsession or grudge with that tunnel.

Are there any incidents
involving that tunnel?

Th-There is. It's in the
paper from two days ago.

I saw the news on TV, too.

Some thug on a motorcycle was driving drunk

and crashed into the tunnel's entrance.

John Doe is unconscious and in critical
condition with injuries all over his body.

He's undergoing intensive care
at Budogaoka Hospital now.

Sounds like he's a victim of the Stand, too.

Anyone else?

W-Wait a sec.

When I saw the scene of the accident
on TV, there was blood all over.

Th-That Stand is one that
sucks up nutrients, right?

This sounds like a different injury.

Isn't it possible that the John Doe

who's in critical condition
could be the Stand user?

He needs nutrients from other
people to heal himself...

What? I-It's the ocean!

If I keep going straight, I'll be in trouble!

I need to turn somewhere, or I'm
gonna plunge into the ocean!

That corner!

I'll have to take it going more than 60km/h!
Hello? Josuke? What's wrong?

Koichi! Keep me on the line. Don't hang up!

Here I go, damn it!

Crap! I might crash!

No.

I can do this right now.

I can make this turn.
I will make this turn, damn it!

Yes! I made the turn!

Did you see how I hung in there?! Take that!

Wh-What?!

The ocean's on this side, too!

No Entry

It's Morioh Harbor!

Shining Diamond!

Now for the crumbled wall...

Fix it!

Th-That was close...

It was trying to head straight toward me,

so it couldn't see this wall.

Like a mosquito that can't see a screen,
it's following me by scent alone.

It doesn't have the ability
to think or plan its attacks.

Its only goal is to take nutrients from me.

The theory that this guy's the critically
injured patient makes sense.

Everything fits together.

Josuke!

Koichi, the hospital!

That John Doe must be the Stand user!

Find out his name for me.

Got it.

But, man, this situation is heavy...

H-How am I supposed to get out of this?

How far did he go? That little shit Josuke...

When this arrow wanted to
pierce a motorcycle thug

who was about to die after an accident,

I was wondering what the
hell it was thinking, but...

This is amazing! Just amazing!

Who would have thought he would
create this amazing Highway Go Go?

A Stand ability is all about
the user's mental strength!

The hungrier someone is,
the stronger they are!

No one can defeat the power of a man
so hungry to heal his own injuries.

But I really would have
loved to see Josuke die!

What should I do? What should I do?

A culvert!

I'm glad I found a culvert
that drains into the ocean,

but it just keeps getting closer and closer.

H-How am I going to get out of here?

Wh-Which way should I go?

Um... The ocean is behind me,

which means it's also to my right.

The ocean is definitely bad news.

The left is the way I came from... I think.

Wh-Which way do I go now?

I think the left might be the ocean,
but if I go to the right...

Th-There's the middle, too...

Wh-What's happening?

I'm pressing the gas, but
the speed keeps dropping...

I-Is it breaking down?

Wh-What?! It's not broken?

Then why am I losing speed?

I'm gonna stop!

I-It's coming!

Could it be...

Am I out of gas?

Man, don't scare me like that.

I'm just out of gas...

Then there's no problem at all.

I thought it was some

major malfunction that even
Shining Diamond couldn't fix.

This isn't a problem.

There'll be no problem escaping this.

Still no problem.

I can fix this with no problem.

And the motorcycle, too, of course.

I can't get too relaxed
since that thing teleports,

but gasoline is not a problem.

But it seems

that I do have a problem after all...

I'm lost!

Wh-Which way is the hospital?

Pardon me. I'm in a huge hurry.

I'd like to know which room

the motorcycle accident at
Futatsumori Tunnel is in.

What's his room number?

Please tell me!

Now, listen...

Can you not see what's written there?

Huh?

Visiting hours are over for the day

If you need an eye exam,

you can come in after 9:30 AM tomorrow.

Um, I'm not actually here to visit him.

But there's a reason I need to know his name!

Please, tell me!

Didn't you hear me tell you to go home?

Worthless brats like you are such a bother.

You seem pretty short for
a motorcycle gang member.

Do your feet even reach the ground?

Jeez.

Act 3...

Okay, Master! Let's kill da ho!

Beeetch!

O-Oh, no!

That was close...

These medicines costs 50,000 yen a bottle.

Huh?

They're heavy?!

They're going to fall!

Hey, you! Help me! Hold me up!

Um, by "Hey, you!" did you mean me?

Yes! Who else is here?! This is really heavy!

Well, yeah, but still...

You did just tell me to go home.

Not to mention, I'm so short,
I don't know if I can reach.

Are you going to get in trouble
with your boss if those break?

Then you're going to be like,
"Oh my gah!" Isn't it?

All right, fine! I'll tell you!

He's in room 525!

Yuya Fungami is in 525.

Take that elevator to the fifth floor!

Huh?

Josuke!

Koichi...

Did you find out where he is, Koichi?

Room 525! His name is Yuya Fungami!

It's room 525!

Thanks, Koichi!

It's on the fifth floor!
Hurry and get into the elevator!

Sh-Shit...

I-It just keeps coming in!

Koichi! Reverb Act 3!

You really are a guy I can
count on. Thanks, Koichi!

But 3 Freeze can only attack
one place at a time.

The rest of them are following Josuke!

There it is! Room 525!

I'm finally here!

The vent!

You bastard!

It's only a few more
meters to the room...

This distance is a pain!

I'm just gonna cut through
and kick your ass!

Damn it!

I'm going to get there, no matter what!

I'm going to get there

and kick your ass...

Who the hell is that brat?

This is Yu's room!

Don't mistake it for your own, you dumbass!

Don't worry about him.

You okay?

I thought it had been a while

since I got nutrients from that
first guy in the tunnel, but...

So you're the second one I've
been chasing around, huh?

I'm surprised you really made it here.

I'm a little shocked, actually.

Yu, you know this guy?

Huh?

Nah, I don't know him,
and I don't give a shit.

Great job, Highway Go Go.

I've healed up quite a bit.

If I can get nutrients from two or three
more guys with abilities like his,

I'll be fully recovered.

Hey!

We told you not to lay your lazy ass down there!

And I just told you not to worry about him!

More importantly, come over here
and give me some attention.

Little ol' me can't even move yet.

I really have to take a piss.
My bladder's super full.

Ooh! That's my job!

We promised we'd all take turns doing that!

It's my turn this time!

What? No, it's me!

I don't care who it is.

Just hurry up and bring the
urine bottle and help me go.

Okay!

Then I'll...

Hey, Akemi.

That peach is rotten.

Peel a different one.

How can you tell it's rotten?

Why? Because it reeks.

It totally smells rotten.

From over there?

You've got a point.

I think my nose suddenly
got much more sensitive.

Oh, you're right... It really is rotten.

One of you three is on your period, right?

Am I wrong? Someone's
on her period, right?

Huh?

Ha, so it's you, Yoshie!

Looks like I was right.

And one of you is also really
pissed off right now, huh?

When you get mad or excited,
your body releases adrenaline,

and I can smell it.

What the hell are you mad about?
Is it you, Reiko?

Huh? I'm not mad.

We're all really happy that
you're feeling better, Yu.

Yeah, we're super happy!

There's no reason for any of us to be mad.

Hey, hey, something's not right.

It totally reeks of someone being pissed off.

Don't lie to me.

Which one of you is mad?

It's me!

I'm the one who reeks of all that adrenaline!

Impossible!

You should be completely dried up by now!

How the hell are you standing?

That's because...

You were drinking my IV fluid?

It wasn't much, but I replenished myself.

Release Rohan, the guy you're
holding captive in the tunnel!

You fool!

Highway Go Go still remembers your scent!

Yu!

You three, don't move!

My name is Josuke Higashikata.

My Stand's name is Shining Diamond.

Though its target range is small,

it can throw punches faster than
a ho-hum speed like 60km/h.

I've never actually measured it,

but if it gets closer,
it can go about 300km/h.

Hey, stop! Wait!

M-My spine is still broken.

My arms and legs are still
broken and I'm bedridden.

I'm critically injured!

And you're saying that you're
going to hurt pitiful ol' me?

All right, my bad.
I'll free the guy in the tunnel.

I think he's still alive.

If you replenish his nutrients,
I think he'll live...

S-So...

You wouldn't do something
as cowardly as kicking

an injured person's ass, would you?

That's not something a man would do!

Yeah! That's cowardly!

Oh, I see.

It's true that I probably
wouldn't feel too great if

I kicked an injured person's ass.

It's definitely not manly,
and it pains my heart.

Right? The guilt will stick with you
forever if you kick my ass.

I thought about that, so I already fixed you.

Huh?!

Eh?

Can you move?

You can, right?

Your wounds are all healed up, aren't they?

Th-They are...

Right.

I figured if I fixed you up first,

it wouldn't be cowardly at all, would it?

Yuya Fungami continues his hospital stay.

If he ever tries to use Highway Go Go
again to try to heal himself,

Josuke threatens to kick
his ass over and over.

I feel so refreshed.

I feel like it's New Year's morning

after I just put on a fresh pair of underwear.

Yu!

However, it's rather enviable
that he gets to be nursed

back to health by his fangirls.

Meanwhile, Rohan...

Josuke Higashikata...

U-Um, look, Rohan-sensei,

a lot's happened, but I, uh...

Why did you heal me?

Huh?

You meddlesome brat.

I would have rather die
than be saved by you.

Not to mention, you stepped into the
enemy's trap after I told you to run.

How stupid can you be?

Wha—

Just so you know, I don't consider
this a favor I need to return.

...apparently still doesn't
get along with Josuke.

Also...

After all this happened,

Something terrifying
happened in the basement!

It was so scary! I thought I was going to die!

It might have been scary,

but it gave me an excuse
to dive into the arms

of the one I love so much.

Like that, and that, and that!

You see... There's a cat I've never
seen before in the basement!

A cat?

So the reason it was really scary...

I went down to the basement

because I ran out of mineral water.

And you know how much I love cats, right?

So I was like, "Oh, it's a British Blue."

It had perfect proportions,

and golden eyes contrasting with
its velvet-like, blue-gray fur.

Where did you come in from?

You cute little kitty...

Oh, dear. It's being defensive.

It must have come in from there.

But I can't let it stay down here forever.

It might pee on the potato
sack it's sitting on,

and it might even have fleas.

It's okay to get closer if you
don't make eye contact, right?

Oh, right. I just need to let it
know that I'm not its enemy.

See? My belly's up, which
means I'm being submissive.

Let's be friends.

Why am I trying to humor a cat?

If you don't get out of here,
I'll hit you with this!

You hear? I'll throw it!

Darn it!

Why, you!

It was clinging to the ceiling
like some kind of bug!

A-And what really creeped me out was

that the cat had a hole in its throat.

A hole about as big as a one-yen coin!

And then, from the hole, I heard...

Mreow

A hole?

Could it be a hole from the arrow?

I just frantically waved
the broom around and ran.

Please, could you go check it out?
It was really creepy.

It had a hole... right?

Hey... Is it gone? Did it run away?

No... It's dead.

Huh? What are you talking about?

W-Wait...

One of the shards went right into its throat.

Wait a minute! I was just—

It was an accident.

It's no one's fault. It was just bad luck.

It's not your fault.

It's no one's fault.

Apparently it had a hole in its throat, but...

Now there's no way to tell if
it was a Stand user or not.

No, I'm sure it wasn't...

Good morning, Morioh.

Isn't it a refreshing morning,
now that the rain's stopped?

I just saw a rainbow in the sky

before I came into the studio.
Is it still out there?

"Where am I, mrowr?

What am I doing here?
Meow, meow," he thought.

"Two days go, someone
attacked me with an arrow,

and I survived that, but..."

"M-My body's different from usual!

It's shaped funny! It's all wrong!

Why can't I move from here?"
he thought, bewildered.

Where did he bury it?

I'm so sorry, kitty. Please rest in peace.

"Who's this human lady?

I get a bad feeling from her," he thought.

"The broom! That's it! Now I remember!

This woman...

That's right! A whole bunch of glass
stabbed me, and I couldn't move!

The reason I'm like this now

is because of this woman!"
he thought angrily.

He was perplexed.

"What? Something came out.

When I got angry at that woman,
something just came out."

My toenail? Wh-Why?!

Is it a curse? C-Could it be that cat?!

He lived by his desire and instinct,

so he understood this power,
as well as how to use it.

That's... a Stand user!

Why is this thing growing from
where I buried the cat yesterday?

Just what is this thing?

What did it do to that sparrow?

I couldn't see an actual Stand.

The most important thing is whether
that thing is an enemy or not.

Is it an enemy who wishes
to harm me, or is it...

I should probably kill it, just in case.

It fell asleep after eating.

Is it a plant or an animal?

It'd be easy to kill it,

but it might be worth
watching for a while.

The way it turned around because
it thought it was being called

is almost like a cat, as well...

The fact that it can't resist trying
to smell me is also like a cat.

It looks like it might be okay to pet it.

The way it's purring creepily

as it's about to fall asleep
is also, indeed, like a cat.

But I'm still not sure if it has
any hostility toward me or not.

Let's find out.

Hmm... It's angry,

but this confirms that it doesn't
have any hostility toward me.

This is definitely the cat that
I buried here yesterday.

So it really did have a hole
in its throat from the arrow!

D-Darling?

The woman!

That place scares me.

That's where my toenail came off...

This cat attacked her because
it had a grudge against her!

If she found out about this thing...

That rumor might eventually reach
Jotaro Kujo and the others!

That would definitely be bad news!

That's where you buried the cat, right?

It seems like it's cursed,
so I'm really scared...

I didn't bury it here.
Go back into the house.

You're lying!

You're lying out of consideration
for me, aren't you?

Crap! This cat means me harm, after all!

I still don't know what kind
of Stand ability it has,

but I'm going to get rid of it.

Deadly Queen!

I feel bad for you, but I'm going
to blow you up with this.

First bomb, switch on!

What?!

Impossible! There's no way it can be a dud!

Is it because of this thing?

Is this thing's ability
keeping it from exploding?

Huh? Is that a plant?

Th-That plant is moving!

I told you to go back into the house!

Huh?

Shinobu!

The moment Deadly Queen's bomb moved
away from that thing, it went off!

Could this thing's ability be...

The plant that was a cat
until yesterday thought,

"I'm going to kill that woman!"

I can't allow you to attack her anymore.

I'm going to have to make you disappear.

"Then I'll just have to kill this man
who's getting in my way, too!"

The only time the bomb doesn't explode
is when there's no air around it.

This plant instinctively knew
just how it should kill him.

Could its Stand ability be the
ability to control air freely?

It's coming!

I can't see it, but it released something again.

Deadly Queen!

It is releasing something. It's air!

It's releasing bubbles of air!

You damn cat! I'll crush you!

I can't touch it!

It's like I'm stepping on an invisible balloon!

It really is controlling the air.

What?

Th-That thing...

I can't see it, but I'm sure it
released an air bubble again.

This isn't good... Something isn't right!

What?

The cactus!

Sh-Shinobu!

What is this? Was I,
Yoshikage Kira, just relieved

at the fact that the cactus
needles didn't pierce her eyes?

What is this feeling?

Am I actually worried about someone else?

No!

I'm just worried that if this
woman dies, Jotaro Kujo

will find out about this house!

That's the only reason I was
relieved that she was okay.

That's all it is...

That attack won't work anymore.

Even though I may not be able to see it,

now that I know the mystery behind it...

It's just an ability that allows you
to blow and spread air bubbles.

You are no longer a match for Deadly Queen.

What?!

Th-This thing just...
put an air bubble into my veins!

It's rising higher and higher into my body!

I'm not that knowledgeable
in medicine, but I've heard

that if you inject more than 10cc
of air into a human being's veins,

it can block the vein and lead to death.

This is definitely more than 10cc!

Shit!

It's no use! This is bad...

I have no choice... I have to do it.

Deadly Queen!

I underestimated that thing.

Its ability to freely control the air...

It's a terrifying ability.
Wh-What should I do?

It's coming! It's going to attack again!

What should I do?

That was close...

For now, I guess I'll let this go.

I'll let this go.

He told me yesterday that he buried
that cat's corpse far away.

The cat's curse, as he said,

was just an illusion my mind
came up with out of fear.

I suddenly fainted in front of him...
It was so embarrassing.

But...

He took care of me, even though
it made him late to work.

I was so happy.

It felt like our hearts were connected.

That was the happiest morning of my life.

Well? Is it good?

That Hayato...

He left without saying goodbye again.

Was that brat observing me?

Oh, darling!

That's my plate.

You don't like shiitake mushrooms,
so I took them out of yours...

When did you start liking them?

You've already eaten more than half of it.

But I'm happy to see you
gobbling down my cooking.

I guess you realized that you only
thought you didn't like them, huh?

Yes.

All right, I'm going.

Have a good day, darling.

Jeez... I wanted him to
give me a goodbye kiss.

But we're understanding
each other's feelings.

I'll seduce him soon enough.

He was using a shoehorn
to put on his shoes.

I'm sure he put on the 25.5cm sized shoes.

Having two different sizes of shoes is weird.

It's also weird that Mom and
Dad are getting along lately.

He was even gobbling up the shiitake
mushrooms that he hates.

This is weird, too.

Why was he writing his own name over and over?

And last night...

No matter how many times
I see it, that's potting soil.

And I think the other thing
he has is a bag of cat food.

And then he goes inside his closet...

They're all wearing hats.

Do they have to wear those for school?

Something doesn't feel right...

The attic?

Wh-What is that bizarrely shaped thing?

It's too dark for me to see it clearly.

There it is. It's that bag.

Huh?

Wha—

I-It's moving!

It's not a plant... Those are eyes!

It has eyeballs, and it's looking this way!

Could that cat food be for this thing?

Oh, darling.

What's the matter?

Did you forget something?
Oh, is the thing you forgot

my goodbye kiss?

No...

Aww...

Then what is it? Shall I get it for you?

No, I'll get it.

Why is he back?

Crap!

Huh?!

What?! Th-This thing...

Something I can't see that's inflated,

like some kind of air bubble,
has my arms and neck pinned down!

He's coming up! C-Crap!

The attic! I knew it! That brat...

I-It attacked me when I
tried to shut the window?

Does this thing need sunlight to move?

I-I know! If they're air bubbles...

Yes! So it was the sunlight.

That noise...

Did Stray Cat wear itself out trying to

get the cat food from the shelf using air?

I thought it would stay calm if
there was no sunlight hitting it,

but I guess a tiny bit of light was coming in.

Still...

I thought that maybe Hayato
had gotten in here,

but it appears that it was, thankfully,
just my imagination.

If that brat knew the truth about me,

I would have had to kill him.

He has Dad's face,
but that's not my dad. Who...

Wh-Who the hell is he?!

Yoshikage... My son...

Where are you right now?

I'm sure you've probably changed your
face and name, and have hidden yourself.

How pitiful...  And yet...

Right. We need to find out about any
people who've gone missing recently.

Including those considered runaways.

Kira is probably hiding.

Do you think he'd commit
murders again in that state?

Serial killers like him can't easily
keep their impulses in check.

He will strike again.

Are you sure we don't need to do anything?

We haven't been able to find
a single clue about Kira yet.

That's what I was thinking, too.

But Jotaro said it was fine.

He said he'll have us move
when he finds something out,

but until then, he wants us
to continue being students.

I'd rather look for Kira than study.

We managed to corner him that one time,

so it should be pretty easy, shouldn't it?

Kisara
Drug

Yes. As long as I'm repairing my house,
I'd like to do some renovations, too.

Curses! He's actually taking pictures
of everyone to try to find him!

I guess I'll have someone come
by to give me an estimate.

Jotaro and all of his other Stand
users are doing whatever they want...

I need to make a new Stand user

to take care of those meddlesome bastards...

Hm?

That's...

There's no doubt about it!

Even though his appearance has changed,

our bond as father and
son bring us together.

There's no way I would mistake my own son!

I've found you, Yoshikage...

I'm gonna find out

who the guy disguised as my dad really is.

It can't be...

At this rate, those Stand users will...

I won't allow it!
I won't allow that to happen!

I will protect Yoshikage!

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable

July 15th (Thurs) 7:50 AM

I'm heading out.

I'm gonna be late...
And I've got class duties today!

Episode 31    July 15th (Thurs), Part 1

July 15th (Thurs), 8:02 AM

So tired...

I stayed up way too late last night.

I got plenty of sleep, so I'm
in top shape again today.

Look, Josuke.

Binoculars.

There's a pair of binoculars on the ground.

You're so easily intrigued by
things that are on the ground.

Don't pick them up. They're dirty.

What? Really?

I am not dirty!

Hello, Josuke and Okuyasu.

I-It was you? Don't scare
us like that, Mikitaka.

You're gonna give me a heart attack, damn it!

Oh, stop...

Don't get bashful.
It's not a compliment!

Though, yeah... You showed up at a good time.

There's something I wanted
to get straightened out.

The thing about you being
an alien is a lie, right?

You're just a Stand user who
thinks he's an alien, right?

Stop being ambiguous and
clear things up, damn it!

I have been clear from the beginning.

I am an alien.

Why are you talking like
that all of a sudden?

That's enough.

More importantly, what are you doing,

turning into binoculars
on the road like that?

Oh, yes. I wanted you two
to look at that thing,

so I was waiting here for you.

That thing?

That thing... The electrical
pylon right in front of you.

Electrical pylon?

That's not really an electrical pylon.

It's a remnant stripped of its
wires that's no longer in use.

When construction started on
Morioh's residential areas,

most of the cables got put underground,
so these weren't needed anymore.

What about it?

Are you trying to communicate
with some other planet?

There's smoke coming out of the
middle of that pylon, isn't there?

Huh?

Y-You're right...

Please take a good look at it.

H-Hey, it's a kettle!

What? In a place like that?!

It's, like, 20 meters off the ground!

Would you mind taking a look
about five meters higher?

What the heck is that?

L-Let me see, too.

There! There he is!

There's a guy up there! He's cooking!

What?! Let me see!

He must be living on that pylon.

He's actually making a living there!

He's fishing from the river,
and even has cucumbers growing.

That's really convenient!

I see! So it's basically a
self-sufficient dwelling.

Some people in this world
do very strange things.

Look out!

H-He's...

It's a new Stand user!

Yeah! I just saw him fly!

But what's a Stand user
doing living up there?

It would seem there's a need to
find out more about that man.

I can see them... They're finally here.

Are they interested in me?

Come on over.

It's been a while since
I've spoken to other people.

Look. It looks like he sees us, too.

Want to go over there?

Yeah, but be careful.

We still don't know if that
Stand user is a friend or foe.

July 15th (Thurs)  8:05 AM

Huh? D-Do you need something?

I'm in a bit of a hurry right... now...

Huh? Huh?!

July 15th (Thurs)  8:11 AM

Looking at it up close,
it's bigger than I thought.

You guys, stop right there!

Don't come any closer to this pylon.

Huh?

Move back a bit more.

I just relieved myself, so you need
to step back, or you'll be in trouble.

What are you talking about?

D-Don't tell me this is...

I told you so.

You'll get covered in feces and urine!

That's gross!

Gross? How rude!

I made it spray like that so I could
fertilize the wildflowers over there!

I like to recycle everything I possibly can.

On the right are Asiatic dayflowers,
mountain udo, and watercress.

They're all edible wildflowers!

Not to mention, if there
are wildflowers around,

I can catch wild rabbits
that come to eat them,

so it's killing two birds with one stone.

So you really are living up there?

Doesn't this pylon belong
to the electric company?

What are you talking about?

This is my house that I
bought with my own money.

I bought this abandoned
pylon for 100,000 yen

and made it my own ideal
self-sufficient house!

Bought?

For 100,000 yen?

That's right. Just 100,000 yen.

Because I'm self-sufficient,
I don't have to work at any company.

And even if I never leave here, I get all the
exercise I need by moving around the pylon.

Take a look at this spectacular view.

Huh? W-Wait a minute.

Even if you never leave? Just how long
have you been living on this pylon?

Let's see... About three years now?

Th...

Three years?!

I probably haven't touched
the ground in about a month.

H-Hey, Josuke. I had no idea that
an idiot like this lived in Morioh.

This guy isn't an enemy,
he's just a damn weirdo.

I don't think he's going to attack us.

True...

I guess, for now, we can just
head back and report to Jotaro.

But...

Something's still bugging me...

July 15th (Thurs)  10:15 AM

What's he doing?

Well, I guess kids take videos, too...

But since he's hiding behind that pillar,

it looks like he's doing the same thing I am.

He's following someone and
recording their actions...

Could he be recording someone here?

Hayato Kawajiri

"Hayato Kawajiri," huh...

There's something strange...

about this kid.

July 15th (Thurs)  7:33 AM

I'm home.

Silence

That's strange.

Josuke, you haven't left for school yet?

Josuke!

I'm hungry.

Josuke, that bastard... This is so rude!

How dare he take a bite out of my favorite

Kamakura Custar and then put
it back in the fridge?!

Not to mention, there should have been two left.

That kid seriously pisses me off.

July 15th (Thurs)  8:14 AM

Hey, something fell out of your pocket.

Is that a photograph?

Would you guys mind leaving now?

You don't have to pick it up.
I'll get it myself later.

It looks like a Polaroid.
What's he panicking for?

Seriously, it's okay! Just leave!

What?! You're...

Hey! J-J-Josuke!

You're Kira's dad!

I knew the ghost dad was involved in this!

So you've finally come in.
I've been waiting for this.

When you tell people to come in,
they become guarded and don't come in.

But if you tell people not to come in,
they get pissed off and come in.

You've finally stepped into
Superfly, Josuke Higashikata!

Wh-What?!

Well done, Toyohiro Kanedaichi!

Well done luring that idiot
Josuke into Superfly!

I commend you!

Something's not right! Come back, Josuke!

No, Kira's dad is right there!
The arrow's right there!

You bastard!

Why, you—

What?!

You see, when someone enters this pylon,

they can't get out until
the next person comes in.

If they try to force their way out, they
become a part of the pylon themselves.

That's my Stand, Superfly!

You fell for it, Josuke Higashikata!

Don't let him get away, Toyohiro Kanedaichi!

Josuke!

I said it was my Stand,

but Superfly isn't a Stand that I can control.

It's actually an independent Stand.

I can finally leave, now that
you guys have shown up.

Even I, its user, was held captive by Superfly.

Well, good luck living here in my stead!

That bastard!

He must've been working with
the guy in the photograph.

Okuyasu, is there anything that I can do?

You'll just get hurt, so stay out of it.

Your job's over.

If you could actually turn
into dynamite instead of

dice or binoculars and blow this
pylon up, things might be different.

That I cannot do.

I can't produce any strength
that isn't my own,

and I can't turn into anything
complicated like explosives.

But I'd like to be of some use.

Shut up.

I'm telling you that there's
nothing you can do.

Leave the dangerous stuff to us.

That bastard's starting to run
away because he's convinced

that he's got him trapped in there,

but he must not know who we are.

Hey. You gonna do this, Okuyasu?

I know you're up to it, too.

What's the big deal about this pylon?

Let's crush it, Josuke!

Yeah. There shouldn't be an
issue if I crush it and get out!

Watch it!

The hell? What's with their power?!

This thing's pretty sturdy.

But if we keep attacking it,
this pillar will snap in two.

And look. It looks like that
guy's about to fall off.

Y-You idiots! How can you
do something so terrifying?

Of course I thought about that possibility.

But haven't you noticed?

This pylon is draining your powers and

distributing them throughout itself.

Huh? What the hell is that idiot talking about?

Josuke, just a little more,
and you'll be out of there!

Here we go!

Hold up, Okuyasu. Listen.

Something's not right.
What's that weird sound?

It's the sound of all
the power you guys threw

into the pylon, moving throughout it.

What?

And think about this carefully.

You know that whole
"law of conservation of energy"?

Energy that's running around has to
be able to escape from somewhere.

So where's all that energy's gonna go?

It can't be...

Okuyasu, duck!

What?!

You can attack it all you want,

but all the attacks on the pylon are
just gonna come right back to you.

If you hit it, it'll hit back.
If you cut it, it'll cut back.

Just think about it.

No matter who comes around
with whatever kind of ability,

no one can destroy this pylon!

Okuyasu!

Th-This isn't good, Josuke...

I couldn't dodge it completely.

It ripped a hole in my side.

I guess I should've warned you about that.

And next, you're probably going to think

that if you defeat me, the user,
you'll be able to get out.

But that's futile, too.

This pylon is an independent Stand.

Even if I were to die,

this pylon would probably continue
to trap people inside for eternity.

That's what Superfly is.

Josuke...

For eternity?

But don't get too depressed about that.

You just have to lure someone
else in, Josuke Higashikata.

If one comes in, one can get out.

Just have some sucker take
your place and get out.

It's sort of like playing Old Maid.

It's like human society.

You just need to pass off the
old maid to someone else.

Am I wrong?

Indeed, if someone else is pulled in,
Josuke will be saved.

Huh?

What?

You should be the one to return,
then. Into the pylon...

you go.

You...

Mikitaka! When did you...

Who the hell are you?

Why were you an electrical wire?
When did you get there?

What the hell is that ability?

Why, thank you for asking.

You see, I'm an alien.

What?

Y-You actually can be useful!

Now's your chance.
Please step outside, Josuke-san.

Y-You bastard!

You have my praise, Mikitaka!

Josuke, hurry up and get out.

Get out of the pylon!

R-Right...

I did it!

You bastard! What the hell?!

The guy in the photograph didn't tell me

that Josuke had a friend like you!

I'm an alien, so I'm unaware of
this game called "Old Maid,"

but to suddenly trick Josuke and
tell him that he cannot leave...

It's like an adult beating a child at a game

on New Year's by tricking them.

This is why you should be the
one to remain in the pylon.

You will remain here.

After all the time I spent
living here, I ended up

with these thick calluses on my hands.

There's a lot of stuff in here.

Take this!

It seems you're under the impression
that that's a part of me,

but that is incorrect.

That is not me,

but the pylon's wire that you
were hanging off of earlier.

Yeah!

All right! Now, go to the top
and come back out, Mikitaka!

You're the one who finally
stepped into this pylon.

Do you really think I'd let you escape?

I'm a man who has thought of nothing but
getting out of here every single day!

Did you forget?

This pylon will return whatever you do to it.

That wire's also a part of this pylon!

The angle at which the wire was cut
was made so it would return to you.

H-Have I been defeated?

M-Mikitaka! Hurry up and get out of there!

I can fix a wound like that!

Nope, he's not getting out.

I'm the one who's going to leave!

The direction and angle are perfect.

If you strike it, it'll strike back.

Mikitaka!

Y-You bastard!

I went through some trouble
getting out because of you,

but now I can get out easily.

I'm sure that's gonna hurt when
you try and pry those out,

but you'll have plenty of time to treat it later.

There are some medicinal plants down there, too.

You bastard! Do you think you can
escape just because you're out of there?

I'll chase you to the ends of the Earth, damn it!

Of course I can escape, and rather easily.

You guys haven't even been able
to find Yoshikage Kira, have you?

Who is that? I've never seen him before.

Hello. My name is Kinoto.
I'm the architect you called.

I came to estimate repairs from the fire
and any renovations we might do.

Oh, right. We made plans for you to come by.

Heaven's Door!

Sorry that was so sudden,
but I've been quite cautious lately.

Yay! I got work!
Gonna make some money!
Rohan Kishibe seems like he
has a lot of money,
so I'm gonna make a fortune.
Hopefully I can
overcharge a little bit.

He was born in 1970 and
is a first-class architect.

His name is Masazo Kinoto.

I see.

Looks like he is indeed the one I called.

He's not a Stand user or an enemy.

Hm?

I don't like anyone looking at my back.

I don't want anyone to see my back.
It's not like I have acne, scars, or a tattoo,
but I never want anyone to look at my back, ever!
I can't seem to get a girlfriend. What should I do?!

I have no idea what that's about,

but I guess everyone has
strange concerns and fears.

But it seems like he's safe
to allow into the house.

Though there was that incident
with the Janken kid, too...

Just in case, I'll write in
that he can't attack me.

Huh? Did I do something just now?

No. Please, come in. Let's discuss the job.

Is something the matter?

The room that caught fire
is the one facing the yard.

If you don't come in, we can't
discuss what to do about it.

Oh, please, go ahead. I'll follow you.

Huh?

Now, please, go ahead.

July 15th (Thurs)  9:06 AM

Episode 32    July 15th (Thurs), Part 2

Of course I can escape, and rather easily.

You guys haven't even been able
to find Yoshikage Kira, have you?

You guys haven't seen my face.

Doesn't my name seem fake, too?

I mean, it's Toyohiro Kanedaichi.

Wh-What the hell?

Are you wearing something over your face?

The fact that I thought about leaving here

means I also planned on getting away.

Well, I'll be leaving now.

Y-You bastard!

Please don't come in, Josuke.

I'll remain with this pylon.

What?! What the hell are you talking about?

This all started because I found it,

and this happened because
I turned into a wire

and climbed all the way up here.

I can be useful, too.

I wanted you guys to be proud
of me, and that's why I did it.

Even though Okuyasu told
me to stay out of it.

I got what I deserved.

Please don't worry about me.

If I think of it as if it were
the inside of a spaceship,

it seems quite spacious.

You're pretty weird, but also brave.

Though it really doesn't
matter to me who stays here.

As long as I get to leave,
that's all that matters.

You guys can decide the rest for yoursel—

No, you're the one who'll be staying.

The only time you'll ever get
to hear the word "goodbye"

is when you hear us say it!

J-Josuke!

Y-You bastard!

Since you cut this, I was able
to fix it and climb back up here.

Impossible...

Mikitaka, could you hold on
for another ten seconds or so?

After I beat the crap out of this guy

and drag him back into the
pylon, I'll fix you right up.

Don't fall, Josuke!

Of course I won't fall.

I just said "impossible," but that was wrong.

Let me rephrase that and say, "you fool."

All I wanted to do was leave this pylon.

I wasn't planning on killing anyone...

But now I'm going to have
to knock you off of here

just so I can get away, you fool!

Shut up!

Shining Diamond...

It looks like a very powerful
Stand when you see it up close.

But do you really think you can

lay a finger on me when I can walk around

the top of this pylon with my eyes closed?

I'm guessing its range is about two meters.

Watch it!

Hey, you dumbass! Quit fooling around!

Josuke, move away from there!

It's already been cut with the knife!

He's already cut up the pylon!

That was a dirty trick!

But it's not a speed that my
Shining Diamond can't dodge.

What are you smirking for, you bastard?

Are you that happy about
me kicking your ass?!

I know every nook and cranny of this pylon.

I know exactly which angles to cut

to make the energy come
flying from any direction.

Just like one who's played
billiards way too much,

I know it all too well!

Billiards?

Jo...

Josuke!

You said it wasn't a speed that
Shining Diamond can't dodge, right?

But do you know which direction
it's going to come from?

I wonder how many more shots it just fired.

They're reflecting off of the beams now.

Here they come!

Josuke!

It's coming from behind, too!

Josuke!

This is exactly why I said, "you fool."

That alien or whatever over there

bravely said he'd stay behind with the pylon.

You should have just listened to him.

Then you wouldn't have to die.

B-Both of his arms?

He won't be able to dodge
the next attack like that.

Here comes the energy to finish you off!

It's going right for...

By the way, Okuyasu,

did you happen to see from there how many

of this guy's attacks I smacked
away with Shining Diamond?

Huh? Yeah, I saw.

I'm pretty sure I saw you smack four of them.

What? Did you just say, "by the way"?

Four of them, huh?
Well, that should be enough.

Four shots should be plenty.

What are you two talking about?!

You said they were reflecting.

You said the Stand's energy was reflecting
like billiard balls to attack me.

What about it, Josuke?!

My Stand is Shining Diamond.

I'm sure the old man in
the photograph told you,

but its power is to fix things and
energies that have been destroyed.

Fix... Did you say "fix"?

What are you saying you fixed?!

Are you saying that you actually had
the chance to fix something just now?

You idiot!

You fixed the energies that were reflecting

and returned them to where they originated.

Josuke, I thought you were defeated,

but I guess you had already won.

I-Impossible...

It looks like the line you were supposed
to say was "impossible," after all.

I'm really sorry.

I started living on this pylon
because I disliked other people.

But the old guy in the photograph

said that if I could trap
even one Stand user here,

he would look after me so I
could live in the outside world,

and I ended up going along with it...

Please! Will you let me
go back to this pylon?

I never want to leave here again.

I want to stay in here forever.

I'll never think about leaving
the pylon ever again.

New Morioh landmark:
the guy who lives on a pylon.
Morioh Landmark No. 9:
The Guy Who Lives on a Pylon

He lives completely self-sufficiently,

but if you bring him salt or snacks,

he'll be happy and let you
take pictures with him.

He's a bit shy, so he wears a mask

and won't tell you his real name.

More importantly, about the
old guy in the photograph...

Did he say anything?

Like where his son, Yoshikage Kira,
might be, or anything else?

Is there a Stand user named
Koichi here in Morioh?

What about Koichi?!

Listen, the old guy in the photograph
just happened to randomly

mention it when he was talking.

I didn't ask too much about it,
and he didn't go into detail.

Well, what did he say about Koichi?!

He said that he's been eliminated.

What?!

It seems the old guy in the photograph

had already found his son
Yoshikage Kira's whereabouts.

He said it wasn't just about
protecting his son anymore,

and that he was going to
start attacking, as well.

And this morning, a brand new Stand user
eliminated a Stand user named Koichi...

That's all he said.

July 15th (Thurs)  10:58 AM

Hmm... This is rather...

Whoa! Th-This door will be about 800,000 yen!

And the design is from the
Victorian and Edwardian eras!

It uses materials made in England, too...

This is going to cost quite a bit.

He said he didn't want
anyone to see his back...

Was he acting like that on his
way to my house, as well?

Here you go.

Oh, thank you.

Please, before it gets cold.

Oh, don't mind me.

July 15th (Thurs)  10:20 AM

I hope they're able to find Koichi safely...

July 15th (Thurs)  11:37 AM

Damn it! He's nowhere! Not at home, school,

or anywhere!

Koichi! Koichi!

Where are you, Koichi?!

I'm not giving up!

I'll find you, whatever it takes, Koichi!

That's what's going on.

So I was wondering if you would
use your sense of smell

and tracking abilities to help me find Koichi,

Yuya Fungami.

I'll fix your injuries. This is a trade-off.

A trade-off?

You can't be serious, Josuke!
Don't underestimate me!

You're the one who put me in this
condition, and I'll never forgive you!

Do you think that my pride would
actually allow me to help you?

I guess it's a no, after all.

I thought it was useless to begin with.

Well, see you around.
I don't have time to waste.

Wait, huh?! You're gonna
back off that easily?

W-Wait a second, hey!

Come on, haggle with me a little more.

Okay, fine! I'll help you out!

Come on, now, jeez...

If I keep acting tough,

I'll just be in the hospital longer.
The only one losing out is me.

I can't be nice to my girls
with my body in this condition,

so I'm getting worried and lonely lately,

thinking that they might leave me.

This all happened because I got
into an accident to begin with,

so I've got nothing against you.

So hurry up and fix me up, will ya?

These injuries are killing me!

I already fixed you up using Shining Diamond.

Huh?

You know...

I really am a hot, beautiful guy.

Saying that I resemble a Michelangelo
sculpture would be putting it lightly.

But you know, I think my eyes are
a bit droopier than before...

Can your Stand actually fix me up 100%?

Stop complaining!

More importantly, just how well
does your sense of smell work?

Let's see... I mean,

I don't want you to think of me
like some hunting dog, but...

Sniff

Sniff

Sniff

For example, I can tell that three girls
are walking up the hall right now.

This smell is Reiko, Akemi, and Yoshie.

They're my groupies.

And I can also tell they're coming
here from the pachinko parlor.

Yu! How are you feeling?

Ah, Yu! Yu is out of bed!

Yo.

Are you all better, Yu?

Yu!

There, there, my cute little kittens.

You're Josuke!

What the hell are you doing here?

Looking for an ass whooping?

Hey, stop. I have nothing
against Josuke anymore.

More importantly, you guys were
just playing pachinko, right?

Huh?

How did you know?

Your skirts reek of sweat around the ass.

The only reason you guys
would sit on a vinyl chair

for a long time would be pachinko.

Akemi, you have chocolate?

You won at pachinko, didn't you?

You're right! You're amazing, Yu.

Here, these are for you.

As you can see,

I'm the man I am because of these girls.

You fixed my injuries, so I'll help you out.

You said you're not like a hunting dog?

You're more than that, Yuya Fungami!

July 15th (Thurs)  12:05 PM

What's the matter?

The floor upstairs is also burnt, right?

I'll give you an estimate,
so please, go ahead.

What's with him?

Why does he go to such
lengths to hide his back?

What's going to happen if I see it?

I-I want to see it!

At this point, I can't help wanting to look!

Even if it means tricking him...

Oh, it itches... It itches...

But I can't quite reach it.

Would it be rude if I asked someone
I just met to scratch my back?

That's fine...

July 15th (Thurs)  12:38 PM

This is it.

This is where we found just
Koichi's bag lying on the ground.

Koichi's house is less than two minutes away.

How did this new Stand user attack

Koichi and take him away
on his way to school?

No one saw him.

Josuke...

Our deal doesn't include me fighting, right?

You just want me to track, right?

I don't have to fight the enemy, right, Josuke?

Why are you asking that now?

You were already being followed.

It's that man.

I smell the same scent
as Koichi from that man.

He has something of Koichi's on him!

What? That bastard over there?

Wait! Come back here!

You bastard! What did you do to Koichi?!

M-Mom?

Mom!

This is definitely my mom.

She's unconscious, but she's alive.

I was watching from here,
but I couldn't tell...

When did he change into Josuke's mom?

I heard that Jotaro can
stop time for two seconds,

but this is nothing like that!

Jotaro wouldn't be able to bring in
a random person from nowhere!

If he had come after me directly,

I wouldn't have minded
just knocking him out...

But that bastard went after my mom...

Guys like that are unforgivable!

Guys who play dirty tricks like this!

Yuya! Where is he?

Where'd the bastard disappear to?!

If you were touching him and don't know,

then how would I know?

B-But he's still here, Josuke...

He's nearby. His scent hasn't cleared yet!

Hmm... Yuya Fungami, huh?

It's a bit surprising that
his nose works that well.

Though I was fine with getting caught
when I started following him, anyway.

I was planning on bringing out
Josuke's mother, either way...

In order to observe Josuke.

Observe...

My Stand, Misterioso, observes.

Misterioso carefully observes
Koichi Hirose and your mother, as well.

July 15th (Thurs)  7:37 AM

That kid seriously pisses me off.

I'll just eat his pudding, then!

Josuke! So you were still home.

You're here, right?

These are
your panties

Everyone feels fear.

It's no use trying to hide your
feelings or expressions of fear.

The fear that lies deep within one's heart

can never be erased...

No matter who you are.

Wh-Who are you? How did you get in here?

I just figured it out now by watching you,

but you seem to have a habit of

swallowing your saliva when
you're scared, don't you?

Everyone shows some kind of subconscious
sign when they're scared.

A habit displayed when they're truly scared...

Have you never realized it?

I'm asking you who you are!

I'm not giving you any money!

Get the hell out of here!

Do I look like a burglar to you?

I don't want your money.
Actually, I'd prefer to pay you.

After all, I'm having so much fun right now.

I'm having such fun with
the attention you're giving me.

The fact that you're giving me
attention out of fear, that is.

Gulp

Oh? You swallowed again, didn't you?

See? You just swallowed again!

That's definitely the sign that you're scared!

And once the sign of your fear is discovered,

my Misterioso completes
its invincible attack!

I was able to turn Tomoko Higashikata,

Tomoko
Higashikata

as well as Koichi Hirose, into paper with ease!

Koichi
Hirose

When I slightly startled
Koichi on his way to school,

his sign of fear was blinking twice.

I could tell immediately.

Yuya, I'm asking you where
the scent is coming from!

No matter how tough Josuke
is, I thought that he'd

be scared if I brought out
his mom all of a sudden, but...

Sure enough, I saw Josuke's sign.

Josuke definitely bites his
lower lip when he's scared!

Ba-dump

The next time Josuke gets
scared and shows that sign,

Misterioso will eliminate
Josuke from this world!

Yuya, you keep looking at my mom.

Could it be...

Is it this jacket? Is there
something inside the pockets?

I don't know what kind of Stand
it is, but is it in this pocket?

Oh? Is he going to bite his lower lip?!

Come on, bite it!

Yuya, answer me! Is he in here?!

Damn! Looks like he's not scared yet.

Josuke, I didn't promise to help you fight.

I only promised I would track.

Going any further is way too dangerous.

I accepted this deal because
you fixed my injuries,

but only a fool would put
himself in danger after that.

I'm sorry, but that guy is too creepy!

Then I'll have to see for myself.

There's nothing in there.
Both pockets are empty.

Other than this piece of paper...

The scent is no longer in the pocket...

Could it be...

Don't! If I were you, I wouldn't
unfold that piece of paper!

Episode 33
July 15th (Thurs), Part 3

Episode 33
July 15th (Thurs), Part 3There's nothing in there.
Both pockets are empty.

Other than this piece of paper...

The scent is no longer in the pocket...

Could it be...

It's just a plain, white piece of paper.

What?!

Blam

J-Josuke!

July 15th (Thurs)  12:42 PM

Swip

Now you've done it!

You should really be more careful.

I told you that the floor up
here was burnt, too, didn't I?

I don't see anything out of the ordinary.

It's a perfectly fine back...

I-It's over... I'm finished...

I don't know why,

but I have this fear that if
someone sees it, it's all over!

H-Hey...

I'm already finished!

C-Calm down.

I'm sorry.

I just couldn't hold back my curiosity...

What?!

That's a Stand attack!

There's a Stand on his back?!

If there is, then even if I read
him with Heaven's Door...

I see. No wonder there was nothing written.

This architect had already been
attacked before he came here.

This architect was a victim

of the enemy Stand that's
going to attack me.

Carry me on your back.

It's here! The enemy Stand is here!

Carry me on your back. Okay?

Carry me on your back.

On your back... Carry me on your back, okay?

July 15th (Thurs)  1:39 PM

These are all the people missing
from Morioh, including runaways.

Episode 33    July 15th (Thurs), Part 3

These are all from after Kira disappeared,
so there aren't that many.

So there's a possibility that Kira's
victims might be among them.

I'm not sure about that,
but the possibility exists.

What's important is to not
miss any of his movements.

If a guy holding his breath makes
even the slightest movement,

there will be some kind of change.

Carry me on your back.

Heaven's Door!

Carry me on your back, okay?

Carry me on your back.

What?! I-It can't be...

Has it possessed my back?

Did it transfer to me because
I saw the architect's back?

Damn it!

Burn the pictures...

Hey, burn the pictures.

Pictures?

Burn them, okay? Burn away those pictures...

What are you talking about?

The pictures I took...

Could it be there's one among them

that might get us closer to Yoshikage Kira,

and you're here to get rid of it?

Just burn all of them, okay?
Burn them away, okay?

Shut up!

Heaven's Door!

Let's see...

If I read about who you are
and write in some orders...

Ow!

What?!

I'm a Stand that was born when

Masazo Kinoto's back was
pierced with an arrow...

Cheap Trap.

But my user now is you, Rohan Kishibe.

You're my user now.

Wha?!

Do you get it?

It basically means that you're
using a Stand to attack yourself.

You get that? Okay?

I'm a Stand with a will of my own.

Even though Masazo Kinoto created me,

he couldn't become a Stand user
that could actually control me.

He could only hear my whispers,

and had only the fear that he mustn't
let anyone see his back, okay?

Do you get it? Okay? Do you get it?

Do you get it? Okay?

My ability is to just whisper to people.

Okay? If you get it, burn the pictures.

You bastard... Get away from me!

Damn it! Why, you...

How do I get you off of me?!

That's easy. You just have
to show someone else.

If you show someone your back...

Okay? I'll go away and transfer over there.

You just have to show someone.

Hello, Rohan-sensei!

I always read your manga.

Next time, could you draw a nude?

A nude girl!

Bye!

Burn the pictures, okay?

July 15th (Thurs)  12:47 PM

Josuke!

H-He wasn't shot.

Y-You asshole!

Shining Diamond, eh?

Well, looks like it's just as I heard,

and a bullet from a gun won't do much...

That was scary, right?
Bite it, Josuke Higashikata.

Bite your lower lip.

Are you gonna bite it?!

Bite it! Come on, just bite it
and show me your sign!

So this is his Stand?

Pretty crappy-looking Stand,
just like the old man in the picture!

Not going to bite it yet, I see...

Looks like he's covering up his fear with anger.

I guess I have no choice.
I'll have to show myself.

You've got some nerve, you asshole!

This is it... This creepiness.

He's been hiding all this time,
so why is he coming out now?

He showed up on purpose.

He showed up on purpose
so you would attack him!

He's dangerous... He's too dangerous, Josuke!

True... My Stand's ability
might be a crappy one.

But if I were to explain my ability to you...

I can make various things

into paper and file them away,
and it's extremely useful.

And this paper is Koichi Hirose.

You bastard... So that's
where you were hiding Koichi!

That's Koichi's scent.

He didn't have something of Koichi's...
He had Koichi himself!

He's alive, of course, because my
Stand ability is a crappy one.

I don't have the power or
ability to kill someone.

Though that's not the case if someone
rips it up, like I did just now.

I'll let you off the hook with just an ass-kicking

if you bring Koichi back here right now.

Just try and get him...

If you can.

Koichi Hirose

Koichi!

Because my Stand ability is a crappy one.

I don't have the power or
ability to kill someone.

Though that's not the case
if someone rips it up.

That's the trap!

If it were me, I wouldn't
go after that paper.

Josuke, ignore it.

You bit it! You finally bit it!

Misterioso was waiting for this
moment, Josuke Higashikata!

It was waiting for the moment you bit your lip!

You bastard...

You showed your sign of fear!

No matter how you resist,
once you've shown your fear,

you're powerless before Misterioso.

Thud

I feel bad for Josuke,
but I'm glad I didn't help him.

If I had helped him, that guy
would have probably

gotten rid of me first, since I can find scents.

Do you understand now that there's no power

in the world that can stop Misterioso?

Wh-What?

That metal rod is fixed...

He's trying to use that power to get out.

That paper there

is probably not the paper
that Koichi's trapped in.

I knew it was just bait with the name
"Koichi Hirose" written on it.

That's because the only reason you
were confident enough to show yourself

was because you were holding
Koichi as a hostage,

and it's because he's alive
that you can threaten me.

I knew that piece of paper was a trap...

It was, wasn't it?

But the reason I still tried
to save that piece of paper

was because there was still a
possibility that it was Koichi.

If there's even a 1% chance that it's Koichi,

then my only choice is to try to save him!

Misterioso, you win.

Looks like this is as far as
Shining Diamond's powers go.

However, let me just warn you of one thing...

If you turn me into paper,

you should immediately rip
me up and get rid of me.

If I'm able to come back
from this, I will kill you!

L-Look at you, talking big...

You weren't a big deal at all.

Koichi Hirose

Yuya Fungami, huh?

Not helping out Josuke was
a very smart thing to do.

I could have gotten rid of you easily.

Your sign of fear is to poke at
your chin with your fingers.

But the old man in the picture
didn't tell me to get rid of you,

so I guess you get to stay alive.

That's the smart thing to do.

Want to hear something
interesting about this paper?

Anyone can take out what's
inside if they open it.

It's a very simple thing to do, but it's
quite hard for someone who's in fear.

To Morioh Grand Hotel.

All right! We got rid of
Koichi Hirose and Josuke Higashikata!

Right about now,
Rohan Kishibe should also be...

July 15th (Thurs)  2:21 PM

Which is it?

Which picture has something
to do with Yoshikage Kira?

Which picture is the old man in
the photo trying to get rid of?

Burn them, okay? Burn them.

It's no use...

Right now, there aren't enough clues.

So let's burn the pictures, okay?

Shut up! You're annoying!

Damn it! I have to let them know...

I have to let someone know about this thing.

Yeah, that's right.

Are you spending the night?

No, there's a lot there, so...

A lot there, indeed...

No...

You won't be going to Morioh Grand Hotel.

Josuke, you bastard!
Trying to play it cool...

If, just if, as stupid as this is,
if the one turned into paper

was one of my girls who
makes me smile every day...

If it was any one of my girls,

I would have done the same thing!

Letting you or Yoshikage Kira live
in this town would be totally uncool.

Hand over Koichi!

What you're doing right now
isn't the smart thing to do.

So you're saying that you want to fight me?

You're saying that you're going
to make Kira's dad your enemy?

Very well!

63, 64, 65 kilometers...

Though it lacks power, my Highway

Even though it's not at the hotel yet.

No one's gotten out of the taxi yet.

His scent is emanating
strongly from the car...

But where is he? Where is he hiding?

The scent of this paper...

There's no doubt about it!

This paper smells like Koichi and Josuke!

Wait, Highway Go Go!
Don't open the door just yet.

That bastard is underestimating me.

This must be another trap.

So he's trying to lure me in, huh?

Very well, I accept!

I said I would do it!

He's after my fear.

How is he going to try to scare me?

I need to find that out.

What? What is this piece
of paper stuck in the door?

Underestimating me again. This scent...

This piece of paper is the trap.

I figured out what kind of trap it is.

Open the door, Highway Go Go.

Foom

To think he can turn flames into paper, too...

But I saw through the trap!

Josuke, Koichi, I'll save the two of you!

But I smell something other
than Josuke and Koichi...

This looks dangerous to
just go ahead and open.

What is this?

A scent I've never smelled
before is moving around.

It's faint, but it's moving
inside the paper...

What?!

Crap! Highway Go Go!

Wh-What is this liquid?

I-Is it some kind of chemical?

Damn it, it's one thing after another...

W-Wait...

I smell iron from inside there.

C-Calm down. What he's after is my fear.

If he manages to scare me, he wins.

Iron...

What is it? A machine?

Damn it!

I have no choice but to open it!

Josuke! Koichi!
Koichi Hirose
Josuke Higashikata

Th-That's an electrical current.

He's even got electricity inside the paper!

The smell of machinery that I could
smell from this paper was...

A...

A shredder!

It won't turn off!

Josuke and Koichi are getting sucked in!

Damn it! Highway Go Go!

I-It's no use.

Highway Go Go's powers can't
destroy this thing to stop it!

Josuke! Koichi!

You finally touched it, Yuya Fungami.

You finally got scared
and touched your chin...

You look pathetic.

It was so easy to scare you, Yuya Fungami!

There's no one that Misterioso
can't turn into paper!

No matter who it is, it can do it easily!

Easy? That's why it's so great!

It turns anyone into paper instantly...

That's why it's great!

I lost. You really freaked me out.

But I'll gladly declare my defeat.

Because, now that I'm a
thin piece of paper,

I can stick my hand inside the shredder!

What did you just pull out?!

Don't you dare open up that piece of paper!

I'll gladly turn into a piece of paper.

Josuke Higashikata

Koichi Hirose

Yuya Fungami... You're...

actually sorta cool, after all.

Josuke Higashikata... Koichi Hirose...

S-Stay back, Josuke! Look at this paper!

I-I'll rip it!

Yuya Fungami is in this piece of paper!

Act 3! 3 Freeze!

S-So heavy...

Let's see, what was it?

There was something that I was
supposed to remember about you...

Oh, that's right. I remember.

I said that I would kill you.

That's right... I definitely said that.

I said I would never forgive
guys like you, right?

Guys like you

who take hostages and try to
threaten people emotionally...

W-Wait a minute!

I just liked observing other
people getting scared!

I just recently got this Stand, so I got cocky.

I-I apologize. I feel really bad.

There's something I realized
after watching you...

Huh?

You have a habit of closing one eye
when you get scared, don't you?

That's a habit, right?

But...

When you're even more scared, you close both.

You like observing? Then keep doing it.

Quietly and calmly keep observing.

I-I'm a book...

The Misterioso boy, Terunosuke Miyamoto,

became a book and is thus unable to fight.

Josuke didn't read the contents of the book,

but the book is at Morioh Library.

If you give the staff the title "Misterioso,"

they'll bring it for you,
though you can't take it home.

When reading this book, you sometimes
feel like you can hear a voice.

Well, that's that.

Morioh
Library

Or probably not at all.

Maybe this means that we're
getting closer to Yoshikage Kira.

Though we don't know anything.

Curses... Those resilient bastards!

July 15th (Thurs)  4:10 PM

It's no use calling for help.

Hurry up and burn the pictures, okay?

July 15th (Thurs)  4:30 PM

All right, I'm heading out for a bit.

Where are you going?

To find out what he's
going to do even quicker,

I'll check out the surroundings
of the missing people listed here.

People cannot escape the fate
into which they were born.

He'll definitely make his move.

July 15th (Thurs)  4:52 PM

I'm going to film it...

I'll film the proof that Dad isn't Dad.

No matter what.

Episode 34

July 15th (Thurs), Part 4July 15th (Thurs)  4:43 PM

It's open. Come in.

Rohan-sensei?

Where...

Over here, Koichi.

Rohan-sensei!

What's wrong? You wouldn't explain
anything over the phone...

I'd like you to help me.

I'm being attacked by an enemy Stand.

What?!

A S-Stand? Where is it? Where?!

It's on my back. It's possessed my back.

Your back?

Um... Your back is being attacked?

Yes. It's a very dangerous Stand.
I'm not sure what I should do.

Could you show it to me?

I cannot.

But if you don't show it to me...

If I show it to you, it'll kill
me and transfer over to you!

Hurry up and burn them, okay?

See? It's talking! It's this thing, Koichi!

Huh?

Why are you hiding it?!

Did you call me over here
just to mess with me?

What are you talking about?!

I already told you. If I
show you my back, I'll die!

But you're always messing with me, Sensei.

So that is what's going on.

No! I'm being serious right now!

There's a corpse upstairs!

Huh? A c-corpse?!

Um... What are you doing, Sensei?

Climb over me, and go ahead.

Please, please, go ahead. Please!

Seriously, what's with you?

Well? Do you believe me now?

It's gone!

That's impossible...

Right here, Koichi!

Look, Koichi! This is Masazo Kinoto!

He had the life sucked out
of him, and he dried up!

Wow, that's amazing. You did
a great job making that.

But this is no time to be
joking around, Sensei!

The Stand users made by the old man
in the picture are really after us.

So I rushed over here, thinking that
something might've happened to you, too!

What?

Then this thing...

Anyway, just be careful.

Bye.

W-Wait, Koichi!

I asked you to come because
I knew those shitbags

Josuke and Okuyasu wouldn't believe me!

You have to believe me!
We're friends, aren't we?!

Koichi!

Don't be down, okay?
Even though this has gotta hurt...

I, Rohan Kishibe, have never
faced such humiliation...

You bastard. You'll regret this...

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

July 15th (Thurs)  5:25 PM

Lately, my nails are growing fast again.

Episode 34    July 15th (Thurs), Part 4

Too fast.

That woman running her fingers through
her prized, well-cared-for hair...

Congratulations. You get to live longer.
I'll hold off on picking you right now.

Until I can completely blend into
Kosaku Kawajiri's lifestyle.

So, every time I leave,

my dad, like, totally follows me in
secret, or comes snooping around.

You're going out at night too much.

And whose fault is that?

I got super pissed off, so I totally stole
something in front of him on purpose.

And then I went straight to your place.

Seriously? They've probably got
the cops looking for you now.

Hey... What are you touching my bag for?

What's wrong?

Don't worry about it. It's nothing.

What are you, a pickpocket?
A groper? What a joke.

Morioh. Morioh.

Oh, crap! This is Morioh.

Come on, we're getting off.

Ow...

What the hell?

Watch where you're going
when you get off the train!

Hey, did you see that? He had
a bowling pin nail clipper.

A bowling pin nail clipper, in this
day and age... What a geek.

July 15th (Thurs)  5:07 PM

Do you have the pictures?

Hey, where are you going with the pictures?

Morioh Grand Hotel.
That's the only place I can go now.

To where Jotaro is? It doesn't
matter where you go, okay?

Just give up and burn the pictures.

Well done...

Even though you don't know who could
be watching from which window.

This is dangerous.

There, you see? Every street has an intersection.

See? There's no way you can cross.

Someone will see your back for sure.

The road's just going to get wider,
and there will be even more people.

So let's just not go! Okay?

There's no way you can cross.

You think so?

Masazo Kinoto came all the way to my house.

He must have crossed an intersection, as well.

I just have to figure out how he crossed it.

And he did it... like this!

Stick

This is ridiculously embarrassing,
but I can make it to the station this way.

Yeah, not bad, Rohan Kishibe.

But you've forgotten something.

When Masazo Kinoto was crossing,
I didn't interfere with him!

Hey, jackass! Why are you walking so slow?

The hell did you say?!

See?

Er, hey! Turn around!

What?!

You're the one forgetting
something, Cheap Trap.

Masazo Kinoto didn't have this...

He didn't have Heaven's Door!

Cannot turn around
for one minute.

What?!

All right. Now I should have no problem
walking so that no one sees my back.

You'd better be prepared, you bastard.

Wh-What?

There's no way you're going to make it.

You're the one who's going to die
with your dick all shriveled up.

Just keep running your mouth.

Your only ability is to talk.
And that's been sealed.

Wh-Wh-Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?!

July 15th (Thurs)  5:32 PM

Looks like there aren't any
big intersections for a while.

Hey, can you use your Heaven's
Door ability on animals, too?

Yeah, if the animal has any intelligence.

So that means if an animal sees your
back, I can transfer over to them, too!

Even easier than humans, huh?

True. I have to be careful of these guys, too.

I hate cats.

They glare at you.

Hey, move!

What?! It can't be...

So one of these guys just has
to glance at your back, right?

My ability is only to speak.

But, you see, humans aren't the
only ones that I can talk to.

I'm the one who called them here.

They hate you.

I just told them that you
love killing cats and dogs!

Get him!

Heaven's Door!

I-It's no use! There are too many!

I won!

3 Freeze!

These animals didn't do anything wrong.

So scram, all of you. Shoo.

Th-That Stand is...

Koichi!

What?!

I thought that you might
just be messing with me,

but I was still a bit worried, so I went back,

and you were still acting
weird, Rohan-sensei.

Even outside your house, you were
walking with your back to walls,

and crossing the street with your
back to someone else's, all by yourself.

So you really do have an
enemy Stand on your back.

That's exactly what I admire
so much about you...

You truly are my friend.

It's on your back, right?

I just have to remove the
enemy from your back, right?

Reverb, 3 Freeze!

Heavy...

Y-You did it!

Aren't you a bit naïve?

I'm not sticking to your back with
strength, but with my ability.

Trying to forcibly remove me from your back

means that you'll destroy your back.

Thud

Huh?!

Go ahead and tell Koichi, okay?
Hurry up and tell him!

R-Rohan-sensei?!

K-Koichi...

I'm very moved that you came
here, and very grateful...

But I'd appreciate it if you'd withdraw Act 3.

You can't see it, but my back is
starting to rip ever so slightly...

Act 3! Undo the 3 Freeze!

S-h-i-t. Understood.

R-Rohan-sensei! A-Are...

Of course I'm not okay, Koichi Hirose!

This damage is your fault, isn't it?

Do you get it now?
There's no way to get rid of me.

Peeling me off your back, Rohan,

means that you'll be peeling
away your own back!

Hey...

You're just going to wear yourself out.

Either you'll pass out from
exhaustion and damage first,

or you'll go crazy and kill yourself...

No matter how great the Stand,

they can't defeat me
if my only ability is to talk!

Okay?

The Stand on your back... Just what kind of...

Large Vehicles
Cannot Pass
Through

What kind? Do you want to see?

You want to see what kind of Stand it is?

Fine...

I'll show it to you.

R-Rohan-sensei...

Looks like you've finally lost it!

I guess you finally realized it's
no use going to Jotaro, either!

Jotaro?

I wasn't heading there in the first place.

I was heading here.

I was so happy to finally make it here

that I couldn't help but laugh.

What are you yammering about?

You finally showed your back to someone!

I'm now going to possess Koichi Hirose!

Th-This place... That post box...

Cheap Trap, you turned around here.

Even if you didn't turn around because
you knew what this place was,

because of your ability, you had no
choice but to look Koichi's way.

Wh-What?!

The alley where Reimi is, where you
can't turn around, no matter what!

It's true that if any Stand tried to get
rid of you, no matter what it was,

you'd return the damage to me.

But there was something that
could grasp only you...

Something that'll only take
those who look back.

Something that'll only take your soul!

Let go! Okay? Let go!

Where do you think you're taking me?! Hey!

The afterlife.

I don't know if Heaven or Hell actually exist,

but just in case, I'll write it in for you.

Going to Hell

It wouldn't do anything except talk,
but that was one intense Stand.

Koichi, if you hadn't come,

I wouldn't have made it here,
and it would have killed me.

But since I was so focused on that thing,

I had no idea we'd end up here.

Reimi!

Did you take these pictures, Rohan?

I did.

Something bothers me about them...

July 15th (Thurs)  6:04 PM

So, like, Mika

got her boyfriend to buy her
some expensive brand earrings.

Buy some for me, too!

Next time.

What do you think you're
doing in my apartment?!

Hey, get the hell out!

Hm... A one-room apartment...

I am Yoshikage Kira. Would you be
kind enough to tell me your name?

My nails are quite long, aren't they?

Look how long they are.

Is there anyone who can actually
stop their nails from growing?

There isn't.

Just as no one can stop
their nails from growing,

you cannot stop the destiny
you were born with.

I believe I asked for your name...

M-My boyfriend... What did you do to my—

Don't answer a question with a question!

Didn't they teach you in school not to
answer a question with a question?!

I'm asking you what your name is!

M-Minako! M-M-Minako!

Minako...

Your parents gave you a beautiful name.

I like it.

Minako, I have a request.

It would make me happy
if you would hold these.

I want you to cut my nails with
these geeky nail clippers.

You've never cut someone else's nails?

There's a first time for everything.

Be careful not to cut them too short.

Help... Please...

Help... Forgive me...

Forgive you?

Now, wait a minute.

I'm not angry or anything.

This is something I enjoy.

I chose you because you
suited my taste, as well.

I was born with these tastes, so I'm just
trying to act positively about it.

Positively...

It sounded like you were asking
your boyfriend for some earrings.

Here, he left these for you.

It's a present.

You're very good at cutting nails.
I like that about you, too.

And you are truly adorable
when you don't talk.

What to do, Minako...

I want to take you home with me,

but bringing you into the
Kawajiri home would be risky.

Still, this is refreshing...
This is truly refreshing!

Th-The man and woman he
followed from the station...

He killed them and made them disappear!

That's... Hayato.

What is he doing in a place like this?

This is the opposite direction
from the house and his school...

What's that?

I didn't lock the door...

Hayato... He...

It couldn't be.

He's not human... What is that
thing that's disguised as my dad?

There's evidence that they've been back here.

And there are blood stains on the floor.

Did he finally make his move?

July 15th (Thurs)  8:36 PM

The thing in Hayato's hand
was definitely a handy cam.

It doesn't seem to be in
this room right now...

Hayato...

He's been acting weird
ever since the other day.

I have to find out what Hayato was doing.

I have to find out for sure.

C-Calm down...

I have to calm down and gather my thoughts.

First, this videotape...

Should I show it to someone?

I can't show it to Mom!

Mom totally trusts him.

Should I show it to the police?

Would they believe that a person got
blown up and then disappeared?

More importantly, he's not human...

Could the police even
catch someone like him?

No... Does anyone even exist in
this world who could catch him?

What should I do?

Mom and I are going to be killed eventually.

What am I supposed to do?!

Do you mind if I join you...

in the bath, Hayato?

It's been a while.

I-I'm gonna head out now.

Oh, come on.

We're family, after all...

Wh-What does he want?

I'll be in trouble if he finds this tape.

I'm sorry, Hayato, but could
you let go of the bucket?

I want to draw some water and wash my body.

I-I'll wash your back for you, Dad!

That's a great idea.

But I'll wash your back first.

You're the one who got in first.
I'll wash yours first, then we can switch.

Now, sit down.

What's the matter?
You seem to be sweating quite a bit.

Did you get get too hot?

Y-Yeah...

Then why are you shivering?

Isn't it strange to shiver if you're overheated?

You're tickling me, Dad!

You should know that I've
always been ticklish!

You're... right.

You've always been ticklish, Hayato.

I-I'll wash my front...

I see. So you'll do it yourself.

By the way, I just remembered...

This evening,

I was around the Jozenji area that's
in the opposite direction from home,

and I saw you.

Huh?!

With a video camera!

What were you doing?

Now I know for sure!

This little brat was watching!

This is awful... I thought I'd
peacefully fit into this household...

I've had nothing but misfortune this year.

What an awful year.

Killing this brat will draw attention
to myself, and that would be very bad.

But since he saw that, I have no choice!

I just turned one of the strands
of this brat's hair into a bomb.

If I just cause a slight explosion on his head,

it'll just look like he slipped
and hit his head on the bath.

That's a common accident in our society.

You're going to die.

Die, brat!

Are you going to kill me, too?

Even though I've got video of you...

I'm even videotaping you right now!

What?

I've been suspicious of you this whole time.

Your different shoe size

and the fact that you were practicing
your signature are all on tape!

I've got other tapes, too!

I even took a video of the cat-like
plant you've got in the attic!

I'm the only one who knows
where the tapes are!

But if something were to happen to me,
I'm sure someone would find that place.

What?

Don't you dare lay a finger on me! Got it?

You little shit! You dare threaten me?

I won't let you touch my mom, either!

This isn't good... This isn't good at all!

I need to let Yoshikage know!

Reimi!

You took this picture, Rohan?

Yes, why?

This one is marked. Is there
something wrong with it?

The one you have circled looks a little boy.

Hayato Kawajiri

Oh, him...

It's nothing, really.

He seemed to be snooping around,
so he caught my attention.

But this boy, Hayato Kawajiri, has the
same last name as this man here.

Huh? Really?

Look!

Kosaku Kawajiri

It's the same.

You're the one who
researched this, aren't you?

They do have the same last name.

At this rate, Rohan Kishibe will
find his way to Yoshikage!

July 15th (Thurs)  8:48 PM

Hayato? Hayato!

Ugh...

Hayato, I've been calling you!

You can at least answer me!

D-Darling...

I thought it was Hayato in the bath.

I mean, look at this!

Hayato left his clothes in the hallway
as if they exploded off of him.

Unlike you, no matter how many
times I warn him, he's such a slob.

And he's not answering me again.

I'm sure he's probably got his
headphones on, reading manga again.

Oh! Darling, your fingers are bleeding.

What happened?

We need to put a bandage on it.

I-I'll do it myself.

I can apply a bandage myself.

Okay...

I just got my fingers caught
in the door, that's all.

July 15th (Thurs)  8:50 PM

Hayato Kawajiri?

Are you saying this grade-schooler has
something to do with Yoshikage Kira?

Episode 35    Bites the Dust, Part 1

We're not 100% sure yet,

but Rohan-sensei said
something bugs him about it.

True, there's something wrong if he's
secretly taking videos of his dad.

So, tomorrow morning,
we're thinking of meeting up

and going to visit Hayato Kawajiri's house.

Apparently, Rohan-sensei's
already found the address.

That bastard Rohan sure works fast.

All right. I just have
to invite Okuyasu, right?

And of course, there's Jotaro, too.

I'll talk to Jotaro.

All right. See you tomorrow at 8:30 AM

at the intersection with the Pepsi sign.

Got it.

8:30, huh? I'm gonna be late for school.

But if we talk to this kid,
we might find something out.

Are you okay?

You're acting a bit strange, darling...

And you look pale.

I told you, it's nothing.

I caught my fingers in the door.

Can you blame me for being pale?

More importantly, can you make me some tea?

I'll be down soon.

Of course.

This just came to me out of the blue,

but lately, I can't help but
think that you're immortal.

I'll go make you that tea now.

If something happens to me,
your secret's going to be found out!

Don't you lay a finger on me or my mom!

This isn't a deal!

You have to listen to me! Got it?!

You're too naïve!

Do you really think I would allow that?

I can't believe you actually
got rid of Hayato.

What a stupid thing to do.

I'm trying to think of what to do right now.

It's no use thinking about it.

I see you made it look like
he fell and hit his head,

but the timing was unfortunate.

That Rohan Kishibe has started
investigating Hayato Kawajiri.

They're still not positive
that Kosaku Kawajiri is you,

but they're coming to
check this house tomorrow.

It's a bad idea to stay in this house any longer.

Shut up. I'm thinking right now.

Ever since you were a child,
when things didn't go your way

and there was nothing you could do,
you would always bite your nails.

You poor thing.

You must be in so much despair right now.

There's no other way around it.

You're going to have to
leave this town, Yoshikage.

If you go now, you can escape to someplace
they can't follow you, before they find out.

Are you telling me to flee Morioh?

You know very well that I'm done
with living my life in fear,

having to worry about
someone coming after me!

I will never leave this town.

What?!

The arrow acted on its own!
I didn't do anything!

I didn't even touch the arrow!

Th-The arrow...

Y-Yoshikage!

Hayato! Hayato?!

July 16th (Fri)  7:30 AM

Are you planning to sleep all day, Hayato?

Hurry up and wake—

What, you're already
awake? That's a surprise.

Hayato, breakfast is ready.

Honestly, why don't you ever answer me?

I couldn't sleep very well last night.

He... He found out that
I saw him kill someone.

Anyway, I made sure that he
wouldn't be able to lay a finger

on me or Mom, but...

What should I do now?

I-I don't understand...
What happened, Yoshikage?

You've been acting strange since last night.

Listen to me, Yoshikage!

That Rohan Kishibe has started investigating
Hayato Kawajiri for some reason!

They're going to come
check this house tomorrow.

There's no need to worry.

B-But, Yoshikage!

Deadly Queen has gained a third ability.

I... I don't understand.

What could have happened
to make you so carefree?

-Morioh's Very Own-
Miso-stewed Cow Tongue

Miso-stewed cow tongue.

What? No way! We're on the air already?

Er, um... It's now 7:55, so here's
the weather today for the prefecture.

Today should be sunny.

Hayato! Hey, Hayato! Answer the phone.

After that bath last night, he changed.

Wh-What could have happened?

Hayato! I asked you to answer the phone!

Crash

My precious tea set!

This is all your fault!

Why do you always ignore me?!

Fine! You think your mother's
just a bother, right?!

Do whatever you want, then!

Now, now. Let's not fight
first thing in the morning.

If it broke, I'll just buy you another one.

Hello, Kawajiri residence.

No, it's not.

They had the wrong number.

Hayato's just at an age where
he doesn't want to talk much.

We're family, so we all need to get along.

You know, get along.

Well, I'll head off to work now.

Do you mind if I give you a goodbye kiss?

Huh?

I'll be off now.

H-He left...

No, I'm right here.

Why don't we walk together part of the way?

Going from feeling refreshed
to falling into despair...

So much has happened lately.
I've been on an emotional roller coaster.

But now I'll be able to feel at ease.

Since you cornered me last
night, I was able to mature.

Really, your will last night was so strong.

To think that you would actually turn
around and threaten me, Yoshikage Kira...

Y-Yoshikage Kira?

Did I just say my real name?

A-Are you planning to kill me after all?

Kill you?

Because you found out my secret?

There's no need for that.
Because I've matured.

No matter where you go and
what you do with anyone,

it doesn't matter, because
now, none can rival me.

I have no interest in you anymore.
If I wanted to kill you...

I would have gotten rid of you last night.

From now on, we're all going to get
along and live happily together.

So just relax... Like we're family.

Well, I have to head to the station.

Make sure you study hard, Hayato.

Rival... He just said none can rival him...

Which means there must be others

that have the same kind of abilities as him.

But what's with that creepy confidence?

If he's unrivaled now, does that mean
he's gained some other abilities?

What should I do?

What am I supposed to do?

You're...

July 16th (Fri)  8:24 AM

I've been waiting for you.

My name is Rohan Kishibe.

There's something that I wanted
to ask you out of curiosity.

It's about this picture.

This is you, right?

Were you taking video of your
dad in the corner there?

Wait.

What... is this?

Well, I know that was sudden...

But it's much faster to just read

about Hayato Kawajiri than
to ask bothersome questions,

and I can get honest answers this way, too.

[Warning]
You mustn't
read any further.

Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

What Heaven's Door turns into a book

should just be the memories of this boy's
life experiences, without any falsehoods.

And yet... a warning?

[Warning]
You mustn't read any further.

What in the world is this?

Is this "warning" what he experienced?

I thought I'd just casually
look into this child,

but now this has definitely
caught my interest.

[Warning]
You mustn't read any further.
"You mustn't read any further"?

Who in the world could this warning be for?

An old guy walked by with his fly down.

He sneezed and said, "Damn it."

Some women laughed at him.

Wh-What is this?

This is getting even more confusing.

What does it mean?

Damn it.

J-Just who is this boy?

It rained.

Ugh, the forecast didn't
say it was going to rain!

At 8:27 AM, lightning struck
above the Pepsi sign.

8:27...

Wh-Who in the world is this Hayato Kawajiri?

Why is he experiencing things in the future?

Could he be a Stand user?

No... This is too odd to be a Stand ability.

All I can read with Heaven's Door

is what he has personally seen or heard.

The answer to this should
be written somewhere...

My dad isn't my dad

He made a man and a woman disappear at an apartment in Jozenji by making them explode.

He's a murderer. I found out who
he was. He has inhuman abilities.

My dad's name is Yoshikage Kira

Yoshikage Kira

Kira...

I-I did it!

This kid was the jackpot!

I finally found him!

Yoshikage Kira is Kosaku Kawajiri!

He's disguised himself as this kid's father!

"He was killed by Kira,

He was killed by Kira,

who had matured..."

Deadly Queen's third bomb, Bites the Dust.

Heaven's Door!

Rohan Kishibe, Deadly Queen
is already inside your eye!

That is what you are seeing!

The switch for Deadly Queen's third bomb

has already been activated!

Deadly Queen's third ability...

It is a bomb to blow away anyone
who tries to come after me!

It will activate in anyone who tries to get
close to Hayato in order to learn about me.

He was killed by Kira,
who had matured.
Rohan Kishibe was also killed.

It'll also activate if Hayato happens
to verbally reveal my identity,

and if he writes it down,
it'll activate immediately.

Which means it's a bomb
I implanted in Hayato!

C-Come to think of it,

I was supposed to meet Koichi
and the others here at 8:30...

I finally... found out Yoshikage Kira's identity...

Koichi is coming. I have to tell him...

I... I finally... found him...

Yoshikage Kira is Kosaku Kawajiri.

I found him with my Heaven's Door.

I have to tell...

Koichi...

And now,

this is the real third
ability of Deadly Queen!

K-Koichi!

I-It was a dream?

I couldn't sleep very well last night.

I kept having these weird dreams...

Hayato!

Are you planning to sleep all day, Hayato?

Hurry up and wake—

What, you're already awake?

That's a surprise.

Hayato, breakfast is ready.

Honestly, why don't you ever answer me?

D-Didn't this...

What? No way! We're on the air already?

Th-This morning TV program...

Hayato! Hey, Hayato! Answer the phone.

Th-This isn't a dream...

What I just saw wasn't a dream.

Th-This is the same morning.

It's repeating...

Today's morning is repeating again!

Yoshikage Kira... His name is Yoshikage Kira!

He's doing this!

This is the unrivaled ability
he was talking about,

and he planted that inside me!

Hayato! I asked you to answer the phone!

Oh, yeah!

Look out—

Ow...

That was a nice catch. It was almost
as if you knew it was going to fall.

But if you can hear me,
you could at least answer!

Hello, Kawajiri residence.

Huh? No, it's not.

It appears I'm the only one
in the world who's aware

that this morning is repeating.

It's almost as if you knew, huh?

Apparently you blew someone
up and came back, Hayato.

No, really. I don't know
exactly what you've done.

This is called Deadly Queen Bites the Dust,

and it automatically protects me...

from inside you, Hayato.

Did you know that I already
killed you once last night?

As though as it was trying to remedy

the despair I was feeling
from the situation I was in,

I gained a brand new ability.

By using that ability on you,
time went back an hour,

and the fact that I killed you disappeared.

At the same time,
you became a bomb to protect me.

You told someone about me and the
bomb activated, and then you came back.

Who did you blow away, hm? Come on, tell me.

Who did you kill?

I-I didn't tell anyone...

I see! Then someone must have
been asking you questions.

It must be that Rohan Kishibe.

Even if you have no intention
of telling anyone,

as soon as someone asks you about me,
Bites the Dust will activate.

And then you will blow him up and come back.

The very fact that Rohan Kishibe
encountered you has disappeared!

That is Deadly Queen Bites the Dust.

You won't be able to tell anyone.

There will be no one who
can ask you anything!

Episode 36
Bites the Dust, Part 2

Episode 36
Bites the Dust, Part 2Hello, Kawajiri residence.

July 16th (Fri)  7:57 AM

Huh? No, it's not.

I see. Well done, Hayato.

You protected me from that nuisance, Rohan.

I'm telling you that you
have the wrong number.

Goodbye.

They had the wrong number.
Now, then...

I guess I'll head to work so I can make

my precious family happy.

But first, do you mind if
I give you a goodbye kiss?

Huh?

What are you doing?! My precious teapot...

Why would you do that?!

I never know what you're thinking!

You never even answer me! Why?!

Honestly...

Mom, he's not human.

If I say anything about him to anyone,

they'll be blown away,
and the morning will reset.

If we just keep letting him do what he wants,

it might not happen now, but he'll
eventually kill me and my mom.

R-Rohan Kishibe...

There was someone other than
Kira who had abilities.

I have to do something about Rohan Kishibe.

The only one who can save me
and my mom and defeat Kira

is someone with abilities like Rohan Kishibe!

Th-There he is. It's Rohan.

If I meet Rohan, he'll be
blown away and die...

And then I'll repeat the same morning again.

I have to tell Rohan about
him without meeting him.

I'm going to change fate!

Flip

Wh-What is this?!

[Warning]

[Warning]
You mustn't read any further.

It's Rohan's ability that he
used one me the last morning!

Damn it.

I was hiding from Rohan this time!

Rohan didn't even see me!

Once fate has happened,
it can't be changed...

Hayato.

July 16th (Fri)  8:27 AM

Ugh, the forecast didn't
say it was going to rain!
Episode 36      Bites the Dust, Part 2

You seem to be under the impression that
you purposely broke the teapot,

but that is incorrect.

Whatever broke last morning
will break again, no matter what.

It'll happen because it's meant to be.

That is what fate is.

If you were turned into a book last morning,

you'll turn into a book, no matter what.

This is why Deadly Queen
Bites the Dust is invincible.

It erases my identity and returns
everything else to what it was.

That means I get to observe Rohan
exploding before I head to work.

It rained.
At 8:27 AM,
lightning struck
above the Pepsi sign.

I can't let Rohan die!

I have to save Rohan!

Ah, Rohan Kishibe.

Watch carefully.

He has no idea why he's dying right now.

I wonder if he's thinking about how he
won't be able to draw his manga anymore.

R-Rohan...

N-No!

Hayato, the very fact that you
met Rohan will disappear,

and the morning will continue on.

If I undo Bites the Dust right now,

Rohan's death will just become
fact and not repeat again...

But for now, I won't undo it.

A few of his friends should
also be showing up, after all.

You're going to automatically
defeat them for me, as well.

Just like a landmine.

But Bites the Dust won't cause you any harm,

so you should relax and enjoy
your fun life as a young boy.

Well, I have to head to the station.

Make sure you study hard.

It's all my fault. It's because he met me...

Rohan Kishibe was killed because he met me!

Can't I do anything to defeat him?

Um... Can I ask you something?

Do you know what time it is?

My watch doesn't seem to be working right.

Hello? Are you listening?

It's 8:33...

Huh? Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

Where was it?

Do you know who I am?

No...

Huh... I guess I was imagining it.

Sorry for saying something weird.

8:33... Thanks!

Jotaro! It really is past 8:30.

Strange, though... I wonder
where Rohan-sensei went.

Th-They're Rohan Kishibe's friends!

They were supposed to meet up!

He left the car door wide open
and the key in the ignition.

They probably have the same abilities...

Th-They also came to ask
me about Yoshikage Kira.

That's not like Rohan-sensei...

Crap! If they find out
that I'm Hayato Kawajiri

That's Rohan-sensei's earring.

and ask me about my dad...

Sorry about that.

I overslept and was late
meeting up with my friends.

Huh? I've seen you before... Where was it?

Ah, Josuke and Okuyasu.

Yo.

Yo, Koichi. Good morning, Jotaro.

What, so Rohan's the only
one who's not here yet?

A-And two more...

When he said his friends
were going to show up...

We won't know where Hayato Kawajiri's
house is if he's not here.

He must have been talking about them!

I just remembered I accidentally
grabbed onto this.

Here you go. Your hat.

Th-Thanks...

That angle...

It's that angle. I'm sure
I've seen him before...

Where was it? I know I've seen him...

Koichi. Look at the name on his backpack.

Huh?

Hayato Kawajiri

Hayato Kawajiri?!

What?!

I-I've been found out!

Wake up
The weather report begins
Kira leaves the house
Hayato meets Rohan
Lightning strikes the Pepsi sign
Rohan Kishibe dies from explosion

July 16th (Fri)  8:34 AM

Hayato Kawajiri...

What are you doing here?

Is it a coincidence?

D-Does this have to do with
Rohan-sensei not being here?

If these four start asking me about my dad...

They're all going to be blown away!

N-No! Don't ask me any questions...

If you guys die, too,
who's going to defeat him?

Even if I have to deceive them...

I can't let these people die, no matter what!

I want to ask you about this photo...

I want to know why you were
recording a video in this photo.

Why were you recording your da—

M-My nose is bleeding!

I need to go to the clinic!
My nose is gushing blood!

I-I... Bye!

Hold it.

Your nose is bleeding? Let me see.

Here. What happened?

I have to go. Excuse me.

You don't need to go to a clinic.

Your nose isn't bleeding.

Huh?

Huh?!

My name is Josuke Higashikata.

He's a relative of mine, Jotaro Kujo.

The one with the scary face
over there is Okuyasu Nijimura.

And the friendly-looking
guy there is Koichi Hirose.

You go to Budogaoka Elementary, don't you?

Then you won't be late just yet.

We just have some questions...

about this picture.

If it's nothing, then that's fine.

W-Well, it is something!
Don't ask me any questions!

You can't ask me any questions!

Is the person in this picture

your da—

No! Don't say any more!

I-It's no use...

Now they're going to ask even more questions.

What do you mean by "Don't say anymore"?

One after another...

What are we not supposed to say?

I can't stop it anymore!

Are you talking about your dad?

They're going to explode!

They're all going to explode!

You suddenly shouted, "No!"

"Don't say any more"?

But we didn't ask you anything yet.

Could it be...

that even asking you a
question is a bad idea?
They're going to explode...
Explode... Explode...

I know...

I-If I die, no one else will have to die!

Since I'm the bomb, I just need to die!

If I die, I'm sure these people will be
able to defeat him and save my mom!

Come on, ask him about
Kosaku Kawajiri already.

Wait, Josuke. Something's wrong.

What are you crouching down for?

I-It won't go through...

For some reason, the box cutter
won't go into my throat!

That's...

That Stand...

I'd never forget it after seeing it once!

Deadly Queen!

To be more precise,

its Deadly Queen's third bomb, Bites the Dust.

It's already too late to attack.

If you're seeing me, that means
I'm already inside your eyes.

It doesn't matter how many of you
there are, because all at once...

You tried to find out my identity!

What, you're already awake?

I'm glad you replied for once when I
called you, but there's no need to yell.

Breakfast is ready, so come on.

I couldn't stop it...
Those four got attacked, too.

It's no use... No matter how hard I try,

in an hour, fate is going to
eliminate those four, too...

I can't even kill myself.

My dying would be troublesome to him,

so Bites the Dust must be
automatically protecting me.

He's too strong...

Yoshikage Kira is too much of a monster.

Either he has to die, or he has to undo
Bites the Dust for whatever reason,

or those four are going to die for sure.

Either he has to die, or he
has to undo Bites the Dust...

I always thought there was no
way I could ever kill someone.

There was no way an 11-year-old boy
like me could kill a monster like that.

But there is one way!

A way for an 11-year-old
like me to kill him...

Just one.

And it's sleeping quietly in the dark
attic like a gun resting in an armory.

For the first time in my life, I was praying
to God from the bottom of my heart.

"Lord, please let me kill this man somehow."

I was right.

This cat-like plant starts moving
when sunlight hits it,

and then attacks by shooting air bullets.

And even with just this little bit of light
in the room, it's so destructive.

This behavior...

I'll utilize this behavior

and attack him with an
air bullet at point blank range.

Point blank range...

But when and how am I supposed to do that?

I can't do it in or near the house.

Mom's here.

That's it... My hat!

He'll come to put the hat on my head.

That'll be point blank range!

My chance will be when he
comes into range behind me.

That's when I have to do it!

What? No way! We're on the air already?

Er, um... It's now 7:55...

Dad was saying that he wanted
another cup of coffee.

Hello?

No, you've got the wrong number.

This isn't the Sakurai residence.

Here you go, darling. Thanks for waiting.

Here's your fresh cup of coffee.

Right...

It's a lovely morning.

I guess it wouldn't hurt to have
another cup before I go to work.

Fate doesn't change with
Bites the Dust, right?

Something that's been destroyed once will be
destroyed, no matter how much I fight it.

You said that, didn't you?

My precious tea set!

Serves you right!

All right, Mom, I'm heading to school!

I'll be there for you.
I'll protect you forever, Mom!

I can't believe it.

I really never have any idea
what he's thinking... But...

Maybe he's not so bad after all.

Oh, it's fine. I'll clean that up.

There's nothing we can
do now that it's broken.

More importantly, did you get burnt?

No... I'm fine.

He's not here yet...

H-He's not here... He's not here yet.

S-Something's wrong. He should have
already been here by now...

Why isn't he here?

Ugh, the forecast didn't
say it was going to rain!

I-It's starting to rain!

Did fate change because I
left the house before him?

No, that can't be!

If he's coming to put the hat on my head,

he should definitely come up from behind me.

L-Lightning struck the Pepsi sign!

Calm down. Calm down! There
are still two minutes left!

There's more than two minutes before
Rohan Kishibe is automatically blown away.

I need to believe in fate—

H-He's already by that tree...
He's already right there!

What a lovely morning.
But Hayato was acting strangely...

What was that?

It's just a hunch,
but something was strange...

It appears that we've repeated this morning

three... no, four times now.

I-Is he just that intuitive?

But there's no more time!

I'll just have to attack him from here.

D-Did he figure out that
I have the cat plant,

and that's why he's not coming near me?

No... He's too close if he knows that.

But I have to completely
defeat him in one shot.

If I miss, Rohan will explode,
and then he'll undo Bites the Dust

after the other four are eliminated.

If that happens, he's going to win!

There's no time! Damn it...

Just one more step to the left!

If he just steps out from
behind that filthy tree,

I can attack!

What?! H-He's hidden himself even more!

The look in Hayato's eyes
when he left the house...

He looked determined about something.

It's the same look that the loathsome
Koichi Hirose and shitbag Josuke have.

My hunch is telling me to
carefully observe him...

Though there really isn't
much that Hayato can do...

It's too late!

Once it's a few seconds past 8:29,
the attack on Rohan Kishibe will start!

That brat is shaking.

Those eyes look like a despaired
mouse drowning in a cesspool.

I guess I was just imagining
his determination.

Those are definitely the eyes of a loser.

He moved!

I came to bring the hat you forgot, Hayato.

If there is a God, I thank you!

I thank the fate that got this murderer
to move from behind that tree!

I feel a fighting spirit burning within me!

Take this, Yoshikage Kira!

What?!

Y-Yes!

I hit him dead-on! I... I did it!

Hayato Kawajiri's not coming...

I guess he must've taken
a different route to school.

This is the end, you murderer!

Wh-Wh-What?!

Lately...

Impossible!

With my nails growing so quickly...

I got to thinking about how
unlucky I've been lately.

But inside my pocket...

It seems like, since last night,
luck is coming around to my side.

Remember when Mom's precious
tea cup broke this morning?

When the coffee spilled onto
my wrist, I was burned,

so I removed my watch and
put it in my chest pocket.

What unbelievable luck!

If that coffee hadn't spilled this morning...

How... How is that possible? I...

I... I failed!

I-It's almost time!

Episode 37
Shining D (Diamond) is Unbreakable, Part 1

Episode 37
Shining D (Diamond) is Unbreakable, Part 1What unbelievable luck!

If that coffee hadn't spilled this morning...

How... How is that possible? I...

You brat...

To think that you knew
about Stray Cat, as well!

I guess it's futile.

So long as I don't undo Bites the Dust,
it'll keep automatically protecting you.

I... I failed!

I-It's almost time!

The fact that you tried to kill me
using Stray Cat's air bullets...

Hayato, you wouldn't have
come up with that idea

if you hadn't repeated this morning
three, no, four times.

And the fact that you've
returned for the fourth time...

It means that Bites the Dust's fate

is to blow up not only Rohan,

but another one of his friends, as well.

That means you must have told
people other than Rohan about me.

No... Perhaps you were just asked about me.

Who did you kill?

Hm? Was there a shrimp named Koichi?

What about Jotaro Kujo?

I'd be very happy if he were to die.

E-Everything's over...

Letting you return to this
morning again is dangerous.

Because I'll be attacked again.

Once the others die, I'll undo
Bites the Dust for a short while.

Bites the Dust is invincible!

Luck is on the side of Yoshikage Kira!

That name... The name you said just now...

Oh, did I just say my real name?

Yes, my name is Yoshikage Kira.

I don't care if you tell that to anyone.

By the way, what time is it?

I...

I didn't tell anyone.

I never said a single word to anyone
about you in the first place.

I only made a phone call.

He said that he overslept and was late,

so I found his number and woke him up.

I made a call from the house
this morning. That's all!

You're the one who said it.

You're the one who said it yourself!

I was just waiting.

I was just waiting for him to hurry up
and get here without oversleeping!

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable

Episode 37   Shining D (Diamond) is Unbreakable, Part 1

Hey, Josuke.

We're gonna be on time
to meet up with everyone.

Hold it, Okuyasu!

I'm not sure if it's coincidence or fate,

but this guy just said a name
that I can't believe I heard.

I-I-Impossible!

You said "Yoshikage Kira"
just now, didn't you?

Huh? What?!

H-How could such a coincidence...

It's no coincidence!

It's not fate, either! This was a gamble!

I made a gamble!

And he came!

I know I heard you say it!

You definitely just said that name!

It can't be...

You bastard!

If you just coincidentally
have the same name as him,

I can fix your wounds at any time.

H-He's Yoshikage Kira?

Th-That's impossible... You brat!

H-How could this be?

I need to undo Bites the
Dust and protect myself!

Return, Deadly Queen!

Cold... The rain is going down my back.

Honestly, does no one show up on time?

Oh?

That's Koichi and Jotaro.

Yes! I made it in time! I won against fate!

I don't need any intense joy.

But I didn't want any
deep despair, either....

My goal was to live a
peaceful life, like a plant.

You've shown yourself!

Now I'll make sure your face
doesn't look so peaceful.

I guess this picture that Rohan
took was an instant jackpot.

Looks like it wasn't coincidence
that we ran into him, Okuyasu.

I don't know the details,

but since he gave his real
name to Hayato Kawajiri,

we may have gotten here
just in the nick of time.

Just so you know, I wasn't
running away from you.

If I wanted to kill you all,
I could have done so at any time.

The reason I didn't was just
because I don't like fighting.

Strife is the exact opposite

of the peaceful life that
I aim for, so I hate it.

It's easy to win one battle,

but then you accumulate
stress for your next battle.

It's a foolish thing to do.

Fighting with others is a
sad and endless process.

We were coming after you because
you killed Shigechi, you dumbass!

A pig bastard like you whose
hobby is to kill people

doesn't have the right to talk about
what he wants to do, you dipshit!

Be careful, Josuke!

Don't touch that shitbag Deadly Queen's hand.

That's the only reason I
didn't dispose of you all.

You're the only three destroying
my peace right now.

I have no choice but to fight the
ones who find out my identity.

Hey, get behind us, Hayato Kawajiri.

Shining Diamond's range is 1-2 meters,

and it has the ability to fix
anything that's been destroyed.

I won't need to use that ability against you!

I'm just gonna kick your ass!

Josuke!

Dora.

He's strong...

Yes! I can't see it, b-but that's amazing!

Kira just spit blood and went flying!

You're moving way too slow, Deadly Queen!

I guess yearning for a peaceful life
has left you lacking in motivation.

Looks like your Stand isn't cut
out for one-on-one battles.

Josuke, don't let your guard
down just because he's slow!

If it's best to fight him
without touching him,

it'd be better to use my Stand, The Hand.

Bring it!

Scraping away space to teleport, eh?

I attacked Josuke, but now the
direction of my attack has turned...

Toward you.

I-Inside my backpack...

What?!

Though I guess it worked out.

It still hit right on the dot,
despite being the first time I've used it.

I-I wasn't touched... I-I wasn't even touched...

The air... The air breathed fire!

Okuyasu!

Th-The air... breathed fire?

The air...

The reason I kept that
thing around was for this.

I can use Stray Cat's ability to control
the air for Deadly Queen's explosions.

Hayato, You brought it for me!

Invisible air and an unstoppable explosion!

Could any two things in this world
be more compatible than that?

He was keeping it just for this purpose...

And I'm the one who brought it here!

I said that it appears luck is on my side, didn't I?

In Japanese, "fate" is written with
characters meaning "luck that brings life."

How fitting.

Okuyasu Nijimura

Is something wrong, Jotaro?

No, it's nothing.

I just thought the rain
sounded like Josuke's voice.

I'm sure he overslept.

If he doesn't show up in
the next five minutes,

I'm going to head to Hayato
Kawajiri's school without them.

I'll fix you right now, Okuyasu!

That's not going to happen.

Because I'm going to blow you away first.

It launched air like a bullet!

And he turned that air into a bomb!

It's coming! You've got to run away!

You can't see it?

It's that area that looks distorted!

I-It's going to hit!

Fix?

He's trying to use that
ability to fix Okuyasu...

The ability to fix things...

To think it's so fast that you were able
to create a wall from the broken slate.

I-It's shooting again!

I-It's coming!

Presumptions are more
terrifying than anything else.

Especially when you're
under the impression that

your strengths or abilities are impressive.

I-It's starting to come through!

Even though it came in contact
with it, it didn't explode!

Hmph. I thought it might blow his head off,

but it appears that the
explosion was a bit shallow.

Deadly Queen's explosions aren't
limited only to things it touches.

That would be a presumption.

It can explode at any given distance.

No matter where you might hide,

or how fast you might try to guard
yourself with a wall or metal plate,

it can go right through and explode freely!

You cannot run anymore.

Die!

It's no use! There's no way to dodge it!

I can't run?

I have no intention of running away...

And I haven't from the beginning.

Then I wouldn't be able to fix Okuyasu!

He's heading toward it?!

I-It went through!

You can make it explode at any distance?

Looks like there's an exception to that.

If I happen to explode when
I'm close to you, Kira,

you're not going to be safe, are you?!

All right, Okuyasu. Now I can fix you.

Don't touch him!

I think... he might have just
used Okuyasu's body and...

Damn that Hayato...

Impossible...

I didn't see Deadly Queen touch Okuyasu.

How can you tell, Hayato Kawajiri?!

You're not a Stand user!

I can tell!

I've lived in the same house
as him until this morning!

I can tell by his expressions!

It touched him without us noticing!

There's no doubt!

Okuyasu's body's been turned into a bomb!

Yoshikage Kira!

I'm not sure...

Since you were charging toward me,

I'm not sure if I was actually
able to touch Okuyasu or not.

It all happened so fast.

Should I just try pushing the button?

D-Don't, Yoshikage Kira!

Hurry up and shoot the next air bullet!

Shoot it at me, damn it!

There's really no need to rush
into attacking you right now.

Josuke Higashikata, I lose nothing
by deciding whether to attack or not

based on your movements.

There's a chance that Okuyasu
wasn't turned into a bomb.

You might be able to fix
him with Shining Diamond.

This might be too forward of me,

but there's only one way to save
Okuyasu's life in this situation...

And that's for you to touch him and fix him.

Even if I turned him into a bomb,
if you touch him using Shining Diamond,

you might die from the
explosion, but Okuyasu won't.

If you were to sacrifice yourself,

you'd at least be able to fix your
best friend's wounds, wouldn't you?

D-Don't touch him!

I'll wait until you make your decision.

You can decide whether you're going
to touch your best friend and fix him,

or come after me.

I'll wait as long as it takes
for you to make your decision,

but I guess there's no way you'll touch him,

even if he is your precious best friend...

I have proof that you shouldn't touch him!

I'm sure he can't control
more than one bomb at a time!

Once he's used his explosive ability,

he can't create the next bomb
until the first one has gone off.

As proof, he could be
shooting off tons of bombs,

but he's only shot off one at a time!

He changed Okuyasu into a bomb,
so he can't shoot now!

What are you trying to say?

I'm telling you that there's
a way to save Okuyasu-san!

And for that...

Deadly Queen, switch on the bomb.

I just need to touch him!

What?!

H-Hayato, you...

All right! Shining Diamond!

You're insane, Hayato Kawajiri...
You've got some guts.

Are you really a grade-schooler, kid?

If I wasn't expecting you to use your
ability to f-fix things, I couldn't do it.

Besides, you can't die.

If you die, he can easily kill me,
and then he'll be free.

He'll eventually kill my mom, too...

and other people in this town again!

No, you'll die.

To think that your ability to fix things

is so powerful that it can fix what
I've blown up instantaneously...

I've just been reminded that it's the most
troublesome ability to have against me.

Deadly Queen!

Josuke, he's firing!

I'll detonate it upon impact so
you can't put your guard up.

However, since there's a chance you'll
dodge it if it detonates on impact,

I shot a small one so it'd be hard to see.

I wonder if you can dodge it while

holding Okuyasu, and with debris from
the explosion stuck in your wounds...

Hurry up and run, Josuke!

If the explosion so much as grazes
you next time, it'll be fatal!

Okuyasu! I fixed your wounds.

Wake up, Okuyasu!

Hurry and move! He's going to get you!

Eight meters until impact.

Come on, you can wake up now!

You're totally fine now, Okuyasu!

Josuke!

Just seven more meters.

Just open your eyes, Okuyasu! Hey!

Hey, Okuyasu! Hurry up
and open your damn eyes!

Hey! Let's work together like
we always do and kick his ass!

Josuke...

I'm going to place that bomb
right under his nose,

as precise as one of
Joe Montana's touchdown passes,

and then detonate it from there.

Four meters until impact.

L-Let go! If you don't run,
you'll be hit head-on!

Okuyasu is... Okuyasu is already...

Shut up!

You need to hurry up and
run away yourself, kid!

Two more meters until impact.

The explosion will cover
approximately a three-meter radius.

I see it! It's about two
meters in front of you!

Hurry up and run away!

Okuyasu... Okuyasu is already dead!

He's not dead!

Okuyasu is fixed!

He's going to open his eyes!

I'll get it one meter closer
and then push the button.

Josuke!

Splash

Th-The air bullet was split
by a knife of blood!

Did the blood flowing through Josuke

just fly out with immense
power and cut it like a knife?

That's it! Just like when I stabbed it with

the needle from the compass in the attic,

the air from the cat weed shrank!

He used the blood from his wound
like a water pressure cutter

to cut through it...

But I wonder about the air bullet.

It didn't shrink! It's heading toward you!

An air bullet that's become a bomb is

kept stable by Deadly Queen's abilities.

That's why it won't shrivel!

No matter if you try to crush it
or cut it into pieces,

the bomb ability won't go away!

It'll detonate as soon as you touch it.

All right, impact.

Huh? H-His body...

is floating?

Detonate!

No, it's not floating...

I can't fix my own wounds with
Shining Diamond's abilities,

but if it's debris from the road

that got into my wound
in the first explosion...

I can fix that!

Th-The piece of the road that was
in his wound pulled his body!

I don't have a choice.

It's someone else's house,
but we're going to run in here, Hayato.

P-Please leave Okuyasu behind.

If you're holding Okuyasu,
you'll be killed!

He'll catch up and he'll get you!

Would you just shut up, Hayato?

Okuyasu and I get along
great. He's my friend!

That's not what I'm talking about!

When you fixed Okuyasu's
wounds, he was already dea—

Stop!

Don't. Don't you dare say any more.

Think about defeating him!

I don't like it...

If he didn't have that
ability to fix things,

my bombs would be invincible.

The most terrifying thing getting in the
way of my peace of mind isn't Jotaro.

It's him!

Josuke Higashikata!

Memo

Good morning.

This is Kosaku Kawajiri.

I realize this is selfish of me,

but I will be around fifteen
minutes late to the office.

Yes. I have to discipline
my unreasonable son.

Yes, sir. I realize this would sound
highly trivial to anyone else. Yes.

I am terribly sorry.

Yes, as soon as I'm done.

Yes, I'll head right to the office.

Yes.

Yes. If you'll excuse me, sir.

Curse that Kosaku Kawajiri
being so apologetic.

Did you want to climb the
corporate ladder that badly,

despite how anxious you were?

The reason Josuke went into that house

is because he knew he'd have the upper
hand in a close-quarters battle.

I will admit that's true.

It's best that I avoid close-quarters
combat with Shining Diamond.

If I can figure out just where Josuke is,

I can shoot an air bullet from here, but...

Hey, you.

What do you think you're
doing on this property?

What? Are you saying you're
not on this property?

Don't get nitpicky with me,
Mr. Goody Two-shoes.

Is this your house?

How long have you been watching?

Hey, I'm the one asking the questions here.

I live next door.

I was thinking about sleeping past noon

when I was woken up by some kind of noise.

You make me suspicious.

Rio, from next door, said her
underwear gets stolen all the time.

And since everyone's
gone around this time...

I'm envious...

Huh?

Of all the free time you seem to have.

Hey, are you running away?

Damn him... Going after Rio like that.

Pisses me off!

He was an underwear thief after all!

These panties...

Th-They're Rio's...

P-P-Pan...

Woohoo! I'm so lucky!

Diamond is Unbreakable
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

Episode 38   Shining D (Diamond) is Unbreakable, Part 2

I-It's no use! The phone line's been cut!

Okuyasu is dead...

I'm going to beat the crap out of

Yoshikage Kira with my Shining
Diamond and defeat him.

I'm going to end this within a few minutes.

Hayato, stay along the wall there
so that Kira can't see you.

Where is he...

going to enter from... is the question.

Huh?!

Wh-What?

J-Josuke!

It's an air bullet!

There's one heading toward you right now!

It's about the same size as earlier...

B-But that's impossible!

There's no way he can tell
where you are from outside!

How does he know?!

Great...

I know, Josuke Higashikata...

I know the exact distance.

Three meters until impact...

I... I can tell...

We can tell where the ball of air is.

Yes!

You'll be able to dodge it!

No matter how many come through,
you'll be able to dodge them... now...

What?

I-It's going after Josuke?

Yoshikage Kira knows where I am.

Where is he? How is he seeing me?

There were no windows in that room!

The curtains are all drawn, too!

There's no way he can see you from outside!

It's automatic! It must be
automatically chasing you!

No, that's not right.

The version of Deadly Queen that's

automatic goes after heat
and is called Heart Attack.

But... It's not going after
the lit cigarette there.

More importantly, if it was
automatically tracking me,

the air bullet wouldn't be
able to go through the wall,

and Yoshikage Kira plans to do the final
detonation himself to finish me off.

It's a mystery, but he knows exactly where I am!

It's getting faster!

Find Kira for me!

Find out how he's watching me!

I-I found him!

H-He's right outside the gate.

Two meters until impact...

He's outside?

I can't figure out how he's able to
pinpoint your location from there, Josuke.

Hurry and run!

That bastard! I don't know
how he's watching me...

One more meter!

But I didn't want you chasing
me in the first place!

Shining Diamond!

All right, it's going to impact on Josuke!

Detonate!

Yes! It was a direct hit!

Deadly Queen!

My, my, that was close.

But I was on my guard.

Your willpower to try to
get one final blow in...

That's why I won't go near
you, Josuke Higashikata.

J-Josuke!

H-He's alive...

Hmph. It was a direct hit,
but he wasn't blown away.

There's a slight discrepancy
when I detonate by hand...

But the damage is absolute.

I can finish him off with the next shot!

W-We... We have to get away from here!

Y-You're pulling me the wrong way...

This is the opposite direction...

Not that way... It's the opposite direction!

I'm going to kill him!

We need to go in the direction
of Yoshikage Kira...

My Shining Diamond

can't fix my own wounds...

But once my blood has left my body and
hardened, it's just another object.

It's no longer part of me.

Therefore, I can gather it and
stick it onto other things.

So I stuck some inside a shard of glass.

The rain stopped, and the blood
stain on his jacket earlier...

should have hardened by now!

That's my automatic tracking bomb.

This stain must have led that
glass shard right to me!

I-It was a direct hit!

It's embedded right into Kira's back!

That's...

Josuke Higashikata's Shining Diamond is
a Stand whose actions I can't foresee...

But the damage Josuke sustained
is greater than mine.

Just one more shot!

One more shot and I,
Yoshikage Kira, will be victorious!

I-It's here! Th-This one's big enough to see!

That must mean...

that this is his final shot.

This will be mine, too!

I-I don't think the same attack
will work twice on Kira!

He'll dodge it!

We'll just have to see about that...

By the way, Hayato, sorry,

but the lighter from earlier is in my pocket.

Could you get it for me?

It's a bit hard for me
to get it myself with

this pole sticking out of my stomach.

The smoke is useless now!

You can see the air bullet!

The air bullet isn't what I want to
use the lighter to see this time.

I'm going to look at something else... So...

Let's find out why he can see where I am.

Don't move, Hayato.

J-Josuke? Wh-What are you...

Stay still, Hayato.

He might not be watching...

He might be listening.

Kira had a cell phone.

Did he just happen to have it? No!

So then, who was he talking to?

Was it his boss from the office?
No, that's not right.

There's only one person that Kira
would be calling right now...

I'd completely forgotten about you,
old man in the picture...

The one who's trying to
protect Yoshikage Kira!

I have no idea when he got
inside my pocket, but...

So this was the answer!

Th-The air bullet passed through the window!

Get back!

It impacted!

Josuke... is running away three meters ahead.

Sh-Shit!

I-It passed him!

And he's now moving diagonally
right, then up... Three meters.

He hasn't figured out that it's Josuke
because he's using a raspy voice!

And now, he's running away
one meter to the left...

What?! How can you do that, you bastard?!

Right there. Detonate!

Yoshikage!

I did it! Josuke's been
blown away, hasn't he?

Yeah, he was gloriously blown away.

All the way to Hell, with my directions.

Though, I mean, he was
a ghost to begin with,

so it's more like he finally made it over.

Josuke...

J-Josuke!

Th-This must be some kind of mistake...

Something this horrible...

should not be happening in my life...

when I just want to live
as peacefully as a plant...

But what I mustn't forget
at times like these

is that it's in times like these,

horrible times like these,

that opportunities present themselves.

I've learned that in the past.

When I'm backed into a corner,
if I think things through rationally,

opportunities will make
themselves available!

I, Yoshikage Kira, have always done this.

There is no trouble that I was

unable to overcome...

Ever!

You're within my range...

Yoshikage Kira!

H-He's near him!

H-He finally got near him!

This is a close-quarters match,
and it'll be over in an instant.

Josuke's ability is greater,

b-but if Kira touches him,
he'll be turned into a bomb!

A-And the wounds in Josuke's
leg and torso from that blast...

Josuke, you shouldn't even
be able to stand right now.

Josuke Higashikata!

Bring out... your Deadly Queen...

Deadly Queen!

H-He's strong...

I'm going to be defeated...

I, Yoshikage Kira, am going to be defeated!

N-No... How could...

We were so close!
Josuke is stronger than him!

Is fate really on the side of that murderer?

M-My fists didn't hit him...

These air bullets acted like cushions!

B-But it wasn't my intention
to have it guard me...

I didn't have time for that!

Stray Cat!

I see... Stray Cat thought
it was being attacked,

so it instinctively blocked the attack!

This is my chance! This is that chance!

A opportunity has presented itself
at the worst of times, after all!

Deadly Queen!

Change that air bullet into a bomb!

I've won!

I've changed it into a contact bomb!

It'll explode if anyone touches it.

Josuke, with the damage you're
currently suffering from,

you won't have the strength to dodge this!

Yoshikage Kira!

It's a contact bomb?!

Josuke! It doesn't matter
if it's glass or wood!

Hit that and take cover!

I've won! This always happens
when life deals its worst to me!

Luck is on the side of Yoshikage Kira!

Wh-What?!

Th-The air bullet went off its course!

Y-You're...

You're...

You're...

O-Okuyasu!

You know, I always wonder

where all the stuff I scrape
away with The Hand goes.

Though I'm not really smart,

so whenever I think too much
about anything, I get a headache.

There.

What?!

I-I can't believe it... I-It's Okuyasu.

But his heart and breathing
had completely stopped...

I had a weird dream...

While I was walking amid the darkness
in that dream, I saw a light.

And I saw my dead brother...

My big brother, Keicho.

He asked me where I was going,

so I said that I was going to follow him.

I mean, my Bro was always reliable.

He never made any bad decisions,
so I'd have nothing to worry about.

But then he said I should decide for myself.

He said, "Okuyasu, you're the one who
has to decide where you're going to go."

I thought for a bit,

and answered that I was going back
to Morioh, and then I woke up.

It was a really sad dream.

Okuyasu...

Y-You've got some nerve,
dreaming at a time like this!

There's that lousy attitude!
Despite your wounds,

you seem pretty okay.

Shut up!

If you were alive, you should
have woken up sooner, damn it!

I-Impossible... Fate should
have been on my side...

I should have been given my opportunity!

Stray Cat! Shoot another shot!

Wh-What?!

Wh-Wh-Whoa... Whoa, there.

Y-Yes! Now Kira won't be able
to use his air bullet bombs!

Th-Th-There's...

There has never been any trouble that I,
Yoshikage Kira, was unable to overcome!

Look, Jotaro!

That loud sound must've
come from that house.

I wonder what happened. Was it a gas explosion?

L-Look! That man is injured!

Josuke and Okuyasu are there, too!

That kid is Hayato Kawajiri from the picture.

And that man is Kosaku Kawajiri.

It looks like everything's falling into place.

Any fate that would side with you...

Any opportunity that would come your way...

is nothing compared to the heart
of justice that's here right now!

It's definitely here! It's right here for sure!

Compared to that heart, you're nothing!

Th-This is a dream...

This... is a dream.

The idea that I'm being cornered like this...

This has to be a dream.

You don't have...

...anywhere left to run.

You're finished.

J-Josuke's badly hurt...

The battle had already begun
while we were waiting.

Which means...

That's Yoshikage Kira.

Someone's hurt over there!

Get back! There's a chance of
an explosion from a gas leak!

Bring the ambulance over here!

Bring the stretcher!

It's dangerous, so please get back!

Are you all right?

Just get back!

Can you hear me?
An ambulance is on its way.

You're going to be all right.

Don't let that lady near Kira!

We'll get you treated at
the hospital right away.

Please, hang in there.

It'll be okay. Hang in there.

O-Oh, no!

That lady's been turned into a bomb!

Can you see how many fingers I'm holding up?

Jotaro, we need your Star Platinum.

I know.

But it's no use unless I can get closer.

Even if I stop time, we're too far away,

and I can't do anything to him.

I have to get at least five meters closer.

You turned someone into a
bomb and took them hostage?

Just try it! I'll fix her right up in a heartbeat!

No! It's not as simple as taking a hostage!

He's got a hidden ability!

It's an ability called Bites the Dust,
and it can blow away time!

Episode 39    Goodbye, Morioh – The Heart of Gold

It must only work on people who aren't
Stand users, like me or that lady,

and occurs coincidentally
whenever Kira is in trouble.

Which means, when he's in despair
like this, this ability activates

and becomes a bomb that can
turn back time one hour!

What the hell?

The knuckles and skin on
your hand are so soft...

You have such cute, white fingers...

Will you rub my cheek?

Huh?

Rubbing my cheek calms me down so much...

When I was a child...

You've heard of Leonardo da
Vinci's Mona Lisa, right?

When I saw that painting in an art book...

When I first saw that,

I don't know how to put it...

Um, this is a bit dirty, but...

Everything About
Leonardo da Vinci's
World

I got an erection.

I just cut out the part with her hands

and hung it in my room for a while.

I want to cut off yours, too.

What are you doing?!

My name is Yoshikage Kira!

I've killed 48 women with
beautiful hands up to now.

You're the only one!

You're the only one who
will know my identity!

O-Oh, no! Bites the Dust is about to start!

If we don't defeat him now,

everyone here but that
lady will be blown away!

Jotaro!

Are you coming for me, Jotaro?

Bites the Dust was created because
I didn't want to run into you!

Come closer! Just try and stop time!

How long will you be able to stop it?

Just try to corner me more!

Pushing me to the limit again will
make Bites the Dust appear!

Jotaro, stop time!

Don't let him push Killer Queen's switch!

Wh-What?

No, this is the limit! I'm pushing it...

Now!

I-I did it! It activated!

I was able to return!

It went into effect.

I was able to have Bites
the Dust take effect again!

I beat them!

Now I can be free!

What was that just now?

The birds came from behind me and...

What just happened?

Come to think of it, this isn't
the way I usually take to work...

But if Bites the Dust did
turn back time one hour,

I should be on my way to work now...

What time is it right now?

That's right. I had put my
watch in my chest pocket.

This is...

Why is it broken?!

It's 8:29! Bites the Dust
did go into effect again!

The watch that Hayato broke with Stray Cat
should have returned to normal, too!

Haven't you realized it?

So the Kosaku Kawajiri that Rohan took
a picture of was Yoshikage Kira...

And it's finally over, isn't it?

They finally cornered you, Yoshikage Kira.

Who are you?

You don't remember me?

Well, I guess that's no surprise.

It happened fifteen years ago.

Something very traumatic must have happened.

Something so traumatic that you don't
even realize what happened to you.

Are you a new Stand user?!

I'll make you realize
that you're already dead!

What?

This isn't any Stand ability!

This is proof that all that's here is the
completely black soul of a dead killer!

Well? Do you remember how you died now?

Even if I stop time right now,
I'm too far away from him.

Don't let him push the switch!

No, this is the limit! I'm pushing it...

Now!

Act Three! 3 Freeze!
He's now within five meters!

S-h-i-t!

You rotten pieces of shit!

Star Platinum! The World!

Koichi, you truly are a reliable guy.

I'm truly thankful that I came
to this town and met you.

And...

Good grief.

I made it in time.

Time has begun to move again.

Crush

H-He did it!

He made it in time!

I'll push it... I'm gonna push it...

Bites the Dust will go into effect again...

H-How? He just suddenly went flying back!

I'm gonna push it... I-I'm gonna push it...

I'm gonna push the switch right now...

I know he's our enemy,
but he really is something.

Hey, stop!

Stop!

Morioh Fire Department

Someone's on the ground back here!

What?!

O-Oh, no! A guy's been
run over by an ambulance!

I didn't realize he was there!

Drive back forward! Forward!

You there! Get outside of the tape!

Get back! Please hurry and get back!

Are you one of the injured, too?

It's no use. He's dead. He died instantly.

He's dead?

It was like he dove under there himself.

This is my responsibility.

I'm not trying to make excuses, but I
didn't have a chance to restrain him.

This is unbelievable.

His head was caught between
the tire and the road...

The skin on his face has been ripped off.

Pardon me.

Do you happen to know the
identity of the deceased?

He said that his name was Yoshikage Kira.

Kira...

There's a family by the name of Kira
in Kotodai that goes back generations.

I heard its only current member lives alone,
so he might not have any family...

An accident... His demise was
due to an accidental death.

But this is how it should be.

There would be no way to punish him in court.

This was the best outcome.

I... didn't actually get along
with my dad that well...

But my dad was murdered by him.

I wanted him punished.

I wanted someone to punish him.

It looks like you remember, Yoshikage Kira...

The exact way you died.

It looks like you remember now!

Just what are you?! Who the hell are you?!

Fifteen years ago, you didn't
have a Stand ability,

so you couldn't make corpses disappear.

That's why, when I died,
it was in all the papers.

Do you remember this wound on my back?

Or, since it was your first murder,
you forgot to take my hand,

so perhaps I wasn't as memorable?!

It's you...

I believe your name was Reimi Sugimoto...

What the hell have you been
doing here for fifteen years?!

Wait...

Why would you go to the
trouble of showing me

the wound on your back and
telling me who you are?

This wouldn't be the place where you're
not supposed to turn around, is it?

My father told me that there was a road in
this town where spirits of the dead walk,

and if you were to find yourself there,
you must not turn around.

If you were to turn around,
an uncontrollable power

would drag you off somewhere.

You weren't showing me

the wound on your back so
I'd end up in front of you,

forcing me to turn around, were you?

You weren't trying to trick me, were you?

Let's have you turn around.

I'd like to see what would happen.

Come on! Turn around!

You will turn around!

Did you really think

that I didn't expect you to try to do this to me?

We've been waiting fifteen
years for you to come here...

"We"?

Arnold!

What?!

Now, let's have you punished, Yoshikage Kira.

What? What are these things?!

Deadly Queen!

Make these things explode!

I-I...

Wh-Where are they going to take me?

Who knows?

But...

I'm sure it's somewhere you
won't be able to rest in peace.

Now,

we can finally...

We can finally go...

Help Wanted

Reimi! Are you really leaving?

It wouldn't hurt if you stayed
a little longer, would it?

It feels like this town's
losing its guardian angel...

It makes me uneasy,
knowing that you're leaving.

Thanks... But there's nothing
left for us to do in this town.

The time has come for us to leave this town.

We have to go.

Or what? Are you going to cry when I leave

because you'll miss me, Rohan?

Don't be stupid.

Kisara
Drugs

Why would I miss you?

You already died fifteen years ago.

I said this before, but I still
believe that ghosts should give up

whatever attachments they have left
here, and just hurry up and pass on.

Oh, fine! Since this is the
last time, I'll be honest!

I will miss you!

Of course I don't want you to go!

Hey.

Josuke! Everyone!

So it's finally over, Reimi.

Yukako! Hazamada, and everyone else!

We came to see you off.

Everyone...

I know it's strange to say this
to a dead person, but take care.

I'm going to miss you, too.

You're a wonderful young lady.

Reimi! Thank you for everything!

Because of you, this town was saved!

Thanks, Koichi.

But I believe we all saved Morioh together.

I'm sure that no one here
will ever forget you.

Thank you, everyone.

Goodbye, everyone.

Goodbye, Reimi.

Goodbye...

He's awfully late tonight...

I wonder if he had to work overtime.

He could call, at least...

Oh, Hayato.

You go on and eat before it gets cold.

I'll eat when your father gets home.

Hayato?

I'll wait, too...

I'll eat with you

when Dad gets home, too...

You sure?

By the way, have you gotten
a little taller lately?

Our town, Morioh, was deeply hurt.

The town was hurt by the
monster named Yoshikage Kira

that this town itself had created.

I'm sure that Hayato's mom

will forever be waiting
for her husband to return.

Shigechi's parents will forever
be waiting for him to return.

The families of the daughters and
sisters killed by Yoshikage Kira

will forever be waiting for their return.

The pain of their wounds
will now only get deeper.

How can we try to ease this pain?

Will it be life-threatening for this town's
future, or will it eventually disappear?

I have no idea.

Are you worried, Jotaro?

About leaving this town?

Yeah, a little.

After watching Josuke and the others
get involved in this incident in Morioh,

there's one thing that I can say...

That the young people in
this town have hearts of gold.

The same hearts of gold shining with justice

that we saw when we headed to Egypt.

I saw that within Josuke and the others...

As long as they have that, they'll be fine.

We won't have to worry
about this town any longer.

Hey, Old Man!

Can't you hear me, Old Man?

Now, then... I guess I should say
goodbye to the son I'm so proud of.

The picture of my mom
that I just gave you...

You still got it?

Yes. I put it in my wallet,
just as you asked.

I'm leaving without seeing your mother,
but I wish her nothing but happiness.

Ah... So you put it in your wallet...

This is the edge of that picture.

Shining Diamond!

I'll be taking this!

A dad should give his son an allowance, right?

Not to mention, if you take
that picture back home,

your old lady's gonna get mad at you again!

Y-You little brat...

You gonna take back what you said about
him having a heart of gold, old man?

Take care!

The invisible baby's
mother was never found,

and the baby ended up being
adopted by Joseph Joestar.

Jotaro Kujo got his doctorate
from a thesis he wrote

while he was here about a
starfish he saw on the beach.

Josuke, that jerk!

He ate the snack I was
saving for myself again!

Ugh!

I'm gonna drink his juice.

Koichi!

Sorry!

I was late because I was making us lunch.

Huh? You made us lunch? Thanks!

I can't wait to eat it.

So good!

Whew

Oh, here it comes! Yeah! That intensity!

You might be able to turn
back to normal, Dad!

Well, whatever.

My skin is so soft!

My eyes feel so refreshed!

The food here was amazing!

Right? Even I look so much more
beautiful that I don't know what

I'm going to do with myself.

You're shining, Yu.

So shiny!

You think so?

I'm shiny, eh?

Grazie!

I look forward to your next visit.

I just saw Ko holding hands
with a really pretty girl!

Huh? What does that mean?
He hasn't told me anything!

Did you hear about
Mr. Kira who went missing?

I did! You mean how he turned
up as a faceless corpse, right?

That's so scary...

What are you gonna do about it?

Wha?

I'm telling you that juice
sprayed out from the can

you kicked and got all over my manga!

That's not my problem!

One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

All right. Warm-up exercises done.

Shonen Jump
Thanks for waiting!
Serialization Returns!

Is it really so interesting to
look at the town all the time?

Nothing ever changes.

It is.

This town is very interesting.

And so, for most people, the summer
of 1999 passed like any other summer.

Hey, did you hear?

Apparently, Rohan was caught
shoplifting at Kame Yu.

What?!

That's insane if it's true.

Yeah, but I'm not really sure.

You aren't even sure?

Jeez... Well, let's go.

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
Diamond is Unbreakable

EndHey, mister! This is the best deal
you're going to find in town!

That's exactly what the other guy said.

Then as a bonus, I'll give
you a tour of the city!

Seriously?

Hilarious!

Huh? What?

What's wrong?

My bag is gone!

What?

Here you go.

So, any changes lately?

Not at all, thanks to you.

I see.

Sorry to bother you.

This is what you want, right?

Yeah!

Oh, but this is all I have right now.

Then this is all I can sell you.

Naples: a city located in southern Italy.

It's a famous tourist spot so beautiful that

people say you should see it
at least once before you die.

Pardon us.

How do you get to Santa Chiara?

Oh, to get to Santa Chiara, go straight,
and then, at the first light—

See? I told you!

I told you it was over there.

My bad...

Thanks so mu—

Whoa, there.

Are you all right?

Th-Thank you...

Um, I'm sorry about that.

Be more careful.

Let's go.

Hey.

You dropped this.

Thank you so much!

No problem.

Hey, wasn't that guy super cool?

I should've asked for a picture.

Did those just come out of my bag?

What? They probably just
landed on it for a second.

Yeah, you're right.

You can't let your guard down in this city.

Pardon me.

Could I get a cone with a scoop of
chocolate and a scoop of pistachio?

Make that two.

You got it.

Episodio 01   Golden Wind

Hey! How many times do I have to tell you

that you can't run your business
here without a license?

Move your car!

Honestly...

You only moved one car length away!

So, whaddya say? It's faster than lining up.

What do you think?

I'll get you into the city real cheap.

Really? How cheap?

L-Luca!

Didn't I tell you that you need to pay

the protection fees you owe me
before doing any more business?

You can't be serious!

I told you that you need to pay
the protection fees you owe me

before doing any more business, right?

But...

Right?!

But I have a family...

P-Please stop!

You should think more about your
friendship with me than your family...

Got it?

I'm not the only one ignoring
you to keep doing business!

Well, who?

Who is it?

I-It's Giorno! Giorno Giovanna!

Giorno?

That kid's been making a fortune lately!

Giorno?

Well, I'll deal with him later.

Hey, you!

You can't run your business
here without a license!

Go somewhere else!

Buon giorno!

I'm finally here!

That flight was so long!

The air sure is different here!

Now, then, time to get to work.

Haruno Shiobana... That's an unusual name.

First, I need to get to my hotel.

I want to dump my luggage so I can
move around a bit more freely.

Let's see... Where's the taxi pick-up...

Whoa, that's amazing!

I know, right? That trick is amazing!

This shouldn't be possible!

How are you even doing that?

That's so gross!

How'd you stuff your whole
ear into your head?

Man, that was entertaining!

Thanks.

Don't attract too much attention
with your job here.

Looking for a taxi?

No, n-not really...

You sure?

I'm just finishing up my part-time job and
about to head home, so I'll make it cheap.

How about 180,000 lire to
get you into the city?

180,000? That's... about 10,000 yen.

That's way too expensive!

The basic rate is about half that!

Wow, you speak the language perfectly.

Huh?

Did you used to live in Italy?

No, I just had Rohan-sensei make it
so I could speak... Never mind that!

M-More importantly, you're saying you'll drive?

You look like you're only in
middle school or high school.

And I saw you give the
security guys something.

I'm pretty sure I saw some money.
What's that about?

Come on, now. You don't need
to worry about those things.

Okay, how about for 10,000 lire?

I won't even ask for a tip.

I'll take you into the
city for exactly 10,000.

Huh? 10,000 would be about... 500 yen?!

No, it's okay.

I'll just wait at the taxi pick-up...

Are you sure?

You'll really only charge 10,000?

Yup.

But you'll have to load your
luggage on your own.

Since I'm not asking for a tip.

Put your luggage up front.
You can sit in the back.

Just so you know,

you'd better not think of me as some
Japanese tourist who's not used to traveling.

Just get me to my hotel in earnest.

Yes. I'll get you there in earnest.

Or should I say...
I'll get your empty luggage there.

Huh? Wait... I didn't even get in yet...

Keep your mouth shut!

Don't tell me...

Hold it!

Ciao!

Reverb Act 3!

Too bad for you...

Didn't I tell you not to underestimate me?

You can run if you want.

As long as my luggage is safe, I don't care.

Look at that! Giorno actually screwed up!

That's what he gets for trying to trick

a Japanese tourist when he's
half Japanese himself!

Though people would never
be able to tell he's Japanese,

with that hair color and a
name like Giorno Giovanna.

It couldn't be...

Huh? It's gone! How?!

Is this some kind of egg?

I-Is it a Stand?! But that's impossible!

Would one show up the
second I get to Italy?!

That's not a Stand! The way that frog felt...

It's actually alive!

But seriously, how'd my suitcase disappear?!

He didn't have any time to hide it!

This is horrible!

This is only a hunch, but...

Excuse me!

Could I ask you some questions
about that taxi driver?

I think it's about time...

Are you Giorno Giovanna?

This is the first time we're meeting.

Do you know who I am, Giorno?

Leaky Eye Luca.

I heard that

even after someone stabbed a knife deep
into your face, you didn't stop fighting.

And because of that,

even though your wound has healed,
your eye is always watering.

Hey, why don't you have a seat right here?

Come on, sit down.

It's tiring having to look up at you to talk.

How old are you?

Fifteen.

Fifteen?! Wow, you're just a kid!

Say, Giorno, there are three "yous"
to remember in friendship.

Three "yous," got that?

The first one is you don't lie.

The second one is you don't hold grudges.

And the third is you respect the other.

Sounds good, right? Those are
the three "yous" of friendship.

Can I help you?

Smack

I'm the one talking right now!

Who said you could ask
questions, you dumbass?!

I heard you've been working
part-time around the airport...

I, Leaky Eye Luca, haven't received

any of the gifts that you should've
given me out of respect yet.

How do you expect our
friendship to last like that?

Let me take a peek at your wallet.

Luca.

I already paid my protection fees.
I don't have any money.

To the security guards?!

That has nothing to do with me!

What's this? A photo of a family member?

Where's my money?

I want the money! Show me your wallet!

Luca...

Don't make me say the same thing twice.

I told you, I already paid,
so I don't have any.

Don't make me say it a third time.

You little shit!

What the hell is that creature?

It came back.

Smack it off!

This frog has nothing to do with this.

I won't smack it off.

I gave you an order, and I told
you to pay me a protection fee!

So you're going to disobey both of those?

You're going to tell me, Leaky Eye Luca,
"no" to both of those things?!

This is a living creature
that has its own conscience,

and it's thinking on its own.

You really shouldn't.

You're... You're...

I could never just smack it off.

Don't! It's harmless as long
as you don't do anything!

You're finished!

Whack

I told you not to.

It's not even that loyal to me yet.

It's just trying to protect itself.
It has its own life.

Any attack on it becomes an attack
on oneself, and it's fatal.

And...

I asked you not to make me say it a third time.

Making me say the same
thing over and over again

is useless.

And I hate that because it's useless.

Totally useless.

A piece of this guy's skin?

Yeah. I want you to get a sample
of it and send it to me, Koichi,

so the Speedwagon Foundation
can check its composition.

Its composition? Who is this guy?

His father, who died, was a bit special.

That's why we want to investigate.

It can be thin. I just need
you to get me a piece.

That's it.

I see...

I'll cover all your expenses for this trip.

What?! All of them?

Hmm...

I'm sorry if this sounds rude, but this
guy sort of looks like you, Jotaro.

The address on this picture
is somewhere around here...

How careless.

You don't need to worry about them.

No one around here is dumb enough
to try and steal their briefcase.

Oh... I guess this is a nice neighborhood.

Hey, can I sit next to you?

Would you like to come in for a meal, sir?

No, I'm going to sit next to him!

N-No, it's okay!

Hey, Giorno! Have some tea with me!

What? Wait, I'll pay for you!

You guys are too loud.

No, me! Me!

I like being alone. Go away.

Fine...

See you tomorrow, Giorno!

Ciao!

Th-That's—

Hey! Whose money is that?!
Are you using my money?!

You?! How'd you know I was here?

Give me back my passport!
Where's my luggage?!

It hurts me to say this,

but they're gone.
I sold them off, unfortunately.

So stop following me.

You're not getting away this time!

What's with this weight?

Wait... So that wasn't
a malfunction earlier?

Don't tell me... he has the same
kind of powers as me...

What did you just say?

It's heavy!

Golden Wind!

Life, spring forth!

Bring forth new life!

I think I just caught a glimpse of something.

Act 3!

That bastard disappeared.

That's impossible!

There's no way he'd be able to escape
3 Freeze's range that easily!

I'll say this one more time.
Don't even think about coming after me.

I hate saying things twice
when I shouldn't have to.

Because it's useless to say it twice.

I'll say this for your own good.

You shouldn't do things that are useless.

Knock him down, Act 3!

Th-The attack on the tree
came back to me...

I took something of yours,

but I can tell you held back
when you were trying to hit me,

when I see what that damage has done to you.

You're a good person.

There's no doubt about it.
Giorno Giovanna...

He's a Stand user!

Giorno Giovanna

Golden Wind

Hello?

Jotaro, it's me, Koichi!

Oh, Koichi. Did you get to Italy?

I found him!

The guy you asked me to find!
Haruno Shiobana!

That was fast.

Where do I even begin?

I immediately ran into him at the airport...

And, yes, it's safe to say...

He's a Stand user!

He goes by the name Giorno Giovanna in Italy.

You mentioned before that

Stand users are drawn to
other Stand users, right?

We seriously met by coincidence!

He's a student, but he
acts like a delinquent.

He stole my money and my luggage!

And it appears his Stand's ability is

returning his opponent's
attack right back at them.

Sorry about all this.

I'll get you a hotel and wire you some money.

Thank you.

Also, his hair was blond,
unlike in the picture.

After asking some people
who knew him about it,

they said that he didn't dye it.
It just suddenly turned that color.

Something about his dead father's genes.

Who's his father?

Are you and his father somehow related?

I'm the one

who killed his father.

His name is DIO Brando.

DIO?

You mean the one involved
with the bow and arrow?

Stab

I found out this year that
DIO may have had a child.

That's why I wanted to find out for sure

if Giorno Giovanna was really DIO's child,
and if he's somehow inherited his body.

But doesn't DIO's body belong
to the Joestar bloodline?

The fact that his hair turned
blond may be a sign that

the DIO blood in him, his Stand
power, recently awakened.

There might have been a trigger...

like a powerful Stand user being in that city.

A powerful Stand user?

Don't go near him anymore.

It's dangerous to take this further.

Understand?

Just one last question...

Is he our enemy?

Or is he a friend?

What do you think?

You're the one who actually met him.

What was your impression of him?

I'm not sure.

But, um...

He seemed like a very eloquent person.

Did you drop this?

No.

I see.

Guess it's mine now.

Let's say you found a bag
with 100,000 lire inside.

would you take it to the authorities?

No way. I'd totally take it.

Well, aren't you honest?

But what if I was a plainclothes
police officer and saw you take it?

I'd give you half and have you
look the other way... probably.

Wow, that's great!

And I'm sure that's actually what you'd do.

You're not kidding or bluffing.

I can tell! You're telling the truth.

You see... I can tell if people
are telling the truth or not.

I'm almost certain.

You know how your skin gets
shiny when you sweat?

That's how I can tell.

I think I'll have an even better
idea if I taste your sweat.

Who are you?

Leaky Eye Luca was found on the ground
near the airport after having

his own spade buried in the back of his head.

It's a rather serious injury.
He won't be regaining consciousness.

I'm trying to find out who's responsible.

Giorno Giovanna, no one knows why
Leaky Eye Luca was at the airport.

But the airport security guards

let me know that you were at the airport.

That's why I figured I'd come see
you and ask you some questions.

Are you actually a police officer?

Of course not.

Luca's no ordinary crook.
He's a gang member.

There are plenty of reasons
he might've been taken out.

He knew how to get people to hate him.

But that's not what his boss is thinking about.

The boss feels like his name was

personally tarnished since
one of his own was taken out.

That's why he told me to find out who
took him out and settle the score.

I'm asking you...

Did you happen to run into
Leaky Eye Luca at the airport?

No. I don't know who you're talking about.

You're not sweating.

All right, I'll believe you.

That does it for my questions.

Sorry to have bothered you, Giorno Giovanna.

What is that?

My hand was clenched the whole time.

That's Luca's right eye.

He's unconscious anyway, so I just brought it.

This taste... is the taste of someone
who's lying, Giorno Giovanna!

Well, well, well, well...

I said I was done with my questions,

but the situation seems to have
changed, Giorno Giovanna.

You told me a lie.

And now, I'm going to have to find
out why you lied to me, aren't I?!

What are you looking at?

Are you jealous?

Did you want to hit him, too?

My name is Bruno Bucciarati.

Answer me.

Your questioning has already
turned into torture.

Well? This is a pretty
creepy ability, isn't it?

Th-That's...

Those are Luca's fingers.

To tell you the truth...

Leaky Eye Luca was disposed of by our boss.

He said that there's no point
in him living anymore.

I took his fingers for torturing.

It's happening again! What the hell?

Is he also like that Japanese tourist?

Other than being able to tell if people
are lying or not, I can also do this...

I can put whatever I want in your mouth.

For example...

I can even put that fire
extinguisher in your mouth.

Though I'm afraid you'd die if I did that...

Talk!

You know who's responsible.

Were you told not to tell anyone?

Let's have you tell me who did Luca in.

There's no doubt about it...
He has a similar ability!

If you don't hurry up and tell me,
your torture is just going to get worse,

Giorno Giovanna!

This guy's bad news!

In that case...

I'll have to use Golden Wind
and dodge his attacks!

Episodio 02
Bucciarati Is ComingEpisodio 02  Bucciarati Is Coming

Giorno Giovanna.

His father is DIO Brando.

DIO always saw women
as mere tools or food,

so it's unknown how Giorno's
mother was able to give birth

to Giorno fifteen years ago
without being killed.

Giorno's mother was a very beautiful woman,

but she was far from a model mother.

After Giorno was born, they lived in Japan,

but she would often go out
at all hours of the night,

leaving young Giorno alone at home.

You sure you should leave
your kid home alone?

Isn't he, like, two or something?

Oh, it's fine.

I'm not about to lose my freedom
just because I had a kid.

Shiobana

Giorno would wake up in the middle of the
night, and his mother wouldn't be there.

How terrifying and despairing that
must be for a child of one or two.

There was no point in crying,
so Giorno would just sit there, trembling.

When Giorno was four,
his mother got married.

She married an Italian, and therefore,
Giorno also became an Italian citizen.

Um...

What are you doing over here?

Come on, Haruno.

Come take some photos with us.

You mother's waiting for you.

But as you'd suspect,
when Haruno's mother wasn't around...

You're always looking at me,
trying to figure out what mood I'm in.

You annoying little brat!

But it was actually the opposite.

What's the matter?

Oh, the bread.

Here you go.

Jeez, you're such a gloomy kid.

The one who got him into the habit
of trying to read others' moods

was this man himself.

This made Giorno

the perfect target for the local
kids to take out their anger on.

Whoa, what's wrong, Giorno?

Why'd you trip over nothing?

Hey, you kids. Hurry up and get home.

Yes, sir.

Let's go.

Yeah.

Go back to Japan, you little freak.

He never fights back, does he?

He's so creepy.

He started to believe that he was the
lowest scum to walk this Earth,

and that it was only a matter of time until

he would grow up to be like the rest of the
twisted people who lived in this town.

But a certain incident would
save Giorno from this fate.

Damn it, where did he go?

Find him! Don't let him get away!

He can't get far with those wounds!

You don't think he went into
someone's house, do you?

Keep your eyes on the ground!
There should be blood.

You go straight ahead. We'll go this way.

Hey, kid.

Have you seen an injured man around here?

He's tall and has black hair.

He went that way.

That way?

He won't be able to move
fast with those wounds!

Let's find him!

He felt no fear.

He just felt that the man

on the ground also seemed alone
and lonely, just like him.

Come on!

Coming!

Thankfully, the man was hidden behind
the grass, which was suddenly taller.

This was due to Giorno's
Golden Wind ability,

but Giorno didn't know he had this ability
yet, so he did it subconsciously.

Around two months later...

I'll never forget what you did for me.

Not long after,

Giorno's father stopped hitting him.

Damn it!

Why does he care so much about Giorno?

Come sit over here, Giorno.

Come on, don't be shy.
The mean kids changed their tune.

I know it's not the best seat, but...

The man was a gangster.

Here you go, kid!

This is... too much.

I think there's been a mistake...

The scoop of chocolate is my treat!

Thanks...

Don't sweat it! That guy always
takes really good care of me.

The man would always just
quietly watch over him.

Despite Giorno being a child who always
tried to read other people's moods,

the man treated him with
respect as a human being.

Giorno learned how to trust others,

a natural trait that should have
been learned from his parents,

from silent interactions with a stranger.

What was that?

A gunshot?

We shouldn't get involved.

Talk about bad luck...

U-Um...

What is it?

The man acted somewhat cruelly,

determined not to drag Giorno
into the world of gangsters.

Hey, wait up!

Hold it!

You're the one who killed
my dad, aren't you?!

You little shit! Damn it!

Damn it!

Damn it!

Your dad was scum.

He broke the rules of my turf by selling drugs.

He even sold them to women and children.

That's why I killed him.

How? Why?!

Why can't I shoot?

You're...

You're a piece of scum, too!

Giorno didn't think the man
was scum in the least.

Bizarrely, the gangs that committed
crimes and broke the law

were what straightened out Giorno's heart.

In a city where politicians were corrupt
and the police didn't protect the weak,

Giorno Giovanna found his reason to live.

Rather than looking up
to a player in Serie A,

he wanted to become a Gang-Star!

This taste... is the taste
of someone who's lying!

My name is Bruno Bucciarati.

Answer me.

Your questioning has already
turned into torture.

Does your head feel wobbly,
as if it's about to fall off?

Though I'm pretty sure you have
no idea what I've done to you.

My body has a zipper?!

Giorno Giovanna.

If I wanted to, I could roll
your head around like a ball

while I ask you who did Leaky Eye Luca in.

I don't think I could withstand
another one of his attacks.

He'll tear me apart!

I only noticed this ability a few months back,

but I've never used Golden Wind
to attack another human.

When Golden Wind hits something,
it can give it life.

Any object can change into any living thing.

But...

Even I don't know what'll happen if

it attacks another human being!

Answer me, Giorno Giovanna!

I don't have any other choice!

Useless!

Bagyah

What?!

Rumble

Y-You're...

a Stand user!
Rumble

So you could see my ability!

A what user?

So you're the one who attacked Luca!

Didn't Golden Wind hit him head-on?

Then he should at least
have a broken bone or two.

You bastard...

Wh-What?

What did you do to me, you bastard?!

What the? I was just trying to stand...

I'm overflowing with power!

I can feel more and more power rising in me...

It's as though my body's been
filled with the gasoline of life.

What?

Its movements look slow.

Whoosh

Could it be that I ended up like
this because of your ability?

Whoosh

Whoosh

You're a fool if you have a Stand
that grants your enemies power!

Take this, Giorno Giovanna!

What? I can see myself...

What am I doing back there?

The handle's not bent!

Did I misunderstand what's going on?

I just thought I was moving
with incredible power...

But my body's actually still over there,

and my consciousness just jumped out,
and that's what's over here?

Crap! I have to dodge!

I-It hurts!

A very sharp pain is gradually hitting me!

It's not that Giorno's slow... It's that
my consciousness went berserk!

Useless!

It appears that when I have Golden
Wind give a living being extra life,

they go berserk... or at least,
just their senses do.

I don't know why I have this ability,

Boom

but I'll definitely be
taking advantage of it.

Bruno Bucciarati

Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?

I'm gonna call the police!

I'm sorry for all the ruckus.

Please rest assured that we'll make
sure not to involve any civilians.

So this is Giorno Giovanna's Stand?

No... It doesn't seem like he
even knows what a Stand is.

But this ability...

It appears as though both of our
abilities only reach a few meters.

And here I thought you were just some brat

who wasn't affiliated with any organization...

Giorno Giovanna!

You're the one who attacked
Leaky Eye Luca, aren't you?!

My boss wants to know why you attacked him!

You wouldn't believe me if I told you
it was an accident, would you?

So I'm going to be disposed of, right?

And you came here fully prepared, right?

When you're going to dispose of someone,

you're always prepared
for the possibility that

you could end up being
the one disposed of, right?

He's going to kill me... He's serious!

This brat is actually going to try to kill me!

He's intense enough

that he'd actually do what
he says he's going to do!

Kabaam

Zipper Man!

So that's his Stand?

Kashink

Now I know for sure that my
Zipper Man is more powerful.

I wasn't told that I need to
bring the suspect back alive.

I wouldn't mind taking care of you here.

But I've had my fill of dealing with
your dangerous powers today,

so I'm leaving.

I'm going to keep my distance for now,

but I'll take care of you eventually.

He can even pass through a solid
wall by putting a zipper on it?!

This isn't good!

Letting him out of the
cable car is gonna be trouble!

If I lose him now, it won't
matter that I have Golden Wind!

If he's going to come after
me 24/7 with that ability,

there's absolutely no guarantee I'll survive!

I'm going to lose!

I can't let him get away!

If he tells his friends about me,
this will end up out of my control!

I have to stop him right here, right now!

For the sake of my future!

O-Ow!

Be more careful, damn it!

He disappeared!

Where could he have gone in that instant?

Don't tell me he can even
enter people with his zipper!

What are you going to do about this?
I'm covered in garbage!

But that's the only thing I can think of!

That must be how he got that eyeball
and those fingers inside me!

Bucciarati went into one of these guys
to hide, like wearing a costume...

And that's how he's planning
to head back into the city.

Better get my broom...

They're all heading in different directions.

I don't see a zipper.

Which one is it?

Which one is he hiding in?

What the hell's your problem,
you stupid fly?!

Jump

A tooth?

I gave life to the tooth that
broke out of your mouth

and had it be reborn as a fly.

The fly would return to you so
I could tell where you were...

But this isn't good.

I just got done saying we wouldn't
involve any civilians...

But my bad. That was a lie.

Still, he ended up hitting
himself with his own power,

so I hope you can just deal with it.

Giorno Giovanna, I can see your
ability is not to be underestimated.

You leave me no choice.

This will be dangerous,

but it seems I'll have to take care
of you right here, right now.

I can't let you escape.

I'm pretty determined about that.

Let me escape?

You don't have to worry about that.

The only thing you have to worry about

is what you'll do once your body parts
have been zipped apart all over the ground.

This battle will be decided
by who hits the other first.

What's the matter?

Come at me, Giorno Giovanna.

Useless!

Thud

Just your senses will go berserk.

"You hit me first, so how?"

I don't blame you for wondering that.

This isn't my arm.

My Zipper Man's ability allows two separate
things to be connected with a zipper.

This is that kid's arm.

I switched it out with mine.

Because, of course, I'd rather avoid the
danger of being hit with your ability.

That's why your Golden Wind didn't work.

What are you trying to do, Giorno Giovanna?!

I'm ending you right now!

Unbelievable... He ripped off his own arm

to extend his range a bit further
and strike a moment faster...

Golden Wind!

I-It's happening again!

Just my senses have gone berserk!

H-He's going to get me!

The destructive power of Giorno Giovanna's
Stand ability isn't too great...

But in this case,
that actually makes things worse!

If I have to experience that slow
pain not once, but multiple times...

I'll probably die from the shock of the pain!

Don't!

Stop!

He went out of range?

What are you doing, Giorno Giovanna?!

Why did you stop attacking me?

Why didn't you finish me off?!

Because you're a good person.

You're in a gang, but you're a good person.

You hesitated for a moment before attacking me,

so I decided I wouldn't attack you, either.

When you saw the arm you
took off of this kid,

you were shocked to see the state it was in

and stopped attacking for a moment.

You were shocked that he'd
been shooting up drugs.

How old is he?

Thirteen.

If you were just some gangster who
wouldn't have hesitated or been shocked,

I probably would've been rolling
around on the ground in pieces.

But you seem different.

That's why I stopped.

There are people in this city
who would sell drugs to kids.

They're unforgivable.

That's what you believe.

But the one selling those drugs is your boss.

You can't help but feel conflicted about that.

That's why your heart ached
when you saw his arm.

So what? That's got nothing to
do with me eliminating you.

I've been ordered to find the one who
attacked Luca and eliminate them!

Just because you stopped attacking me
doesn't mean I'm not going to kill you!

No...

You won't kill me now.

What?

You won't kill me. I know it.

Why do you say that?

Because you're going to join me.

I plan on defeating your boss
and taking over this city.

What?!

In order to get rid of gangs
that sell drugs to children,

I'm going to have to become
a gangster myself.

Are you saying...

that you're going to join our organization?!

Are you serious?!

Do you even know what that means?!

What a great view...

Yes. If I'm going to take over this city,

I'll have to join the organization that
rules it and work my way up.

Bucciarati,

I'm going to become a Gang-Star!

Episodio 03
Meet the Gangster Behind the WallBecause you're going to join me.

I plan on defeating your boss
and taking over this city.

What?!

In order to get rid of gangs
that sell drugs to children,

I'm going to have to become
a gangster myself.

Are you saying...

that you're going to join our organization?!

Are you serious?!

Do you even know what that means?!

What a great view...

Yes. If I'm going to take over this city,

I'll have to join the organization that
rules it and work my way up.

Bucciarati,

I'm going to become a Gang-Star!

Pass! Pass!

Thanks!

Thanks.

Thanks!

Fine.

I'll report back saying I couldn't
find the one who attacked Luca

and introduce you so you
can join the organization.

However, if they find out at any time
that you're going after the boss...

I'm not going to save you.

Traitors can't be saved.

You'll have to deal with your own failure.

Otherwise, I'll wager on your golden dream and

the honorable, golden resolve it took
to go so far as to rip off your own arm,

Giorno Giovanna.

Episodio 03  Meet the Gangster Behind the Wall

Our organization oversees
every industry in Naples.

Passione... That's the
name of the organization.

Passione means "passion," but that's not
actually related to the boss's name.

No one actually knows the boss's name,
nor does anyone know what he looks like.

We receive orders from a number of his capos.

Giorno, the capo who'll be deciding
whether you'll join the organization

is a man named Polpo.

He's in this building.

But this building...

Loom

It's a prison.

Correct. Polpo was convicted
of a certain crime

and won't be out for fifteen years.

But he gives me orders from the inside
and commands the organization.

He can leave this place whenever
he feels like it, but he doesn't.

There's simply no reason to.

But why?

You'll understand once you go in.

Giorno Giovanna, you're going to be
interviewed by him, and you have to pass.

It's basically like any other job interview.

What the interview actually
entails will depend on his mood,

but whatever you do, don't let him
find out your true intentions.

All right.

Oh, yeah. The Stand ability...

That's what you called it, right?

I never asked how you ended
up with that ability,

but are there others with it?

That'll also be answered
once you get inside...

If you pass, that is.

First, place your belongings, watch,

and everything in your pockets into the tray,

then proceed to the next
room for a body check.

Stand right there and raise
your hands over your head.

Once you go through that gate,
please continue straight down the hall.

N-28 is where Polpo's cell is.

The room is divided with reinforced glass,
but you'll be able to talk to him.

Touching the glass, giving him anything,

and receiving anything from
him are all forbidden.

You have fifteen minutes.

Once you pass through, the gate will close.

If something happens, please yell.

I'm going to meet him directly in his cell?

Not in some visiting room?

You don't know who he is?

That left arm of yours...

Is it injured?

That's no bed...

Gwooo

It's just on your right hand,

but the fingers are slightly red,
like you were holding something.

Like lines that would be
left after holding a bag.

Which would mean that you were holding
a bag in your right hand up until now.

Why's that?

Well, uh... You're right.

I was holding a bag in my right hand,

because as you observed, I hurt my left arm.

I envy your ability to be
so reckless with your body.

Would you like some wine?

I have some exquisite Chianti Classico.

It pairs perfectly with some Scamorza
cheese and caviar on a cracker.

I've been told that I'm not allowed

to give you anything or
receive anything from you.

They're just saying that.

What people say and what they do...

are vastly different.

That's the best and worst thing about people.

The only downside to being
in this cell is.... well...

Polpo...
The fact that I can't admire Michelangelo's
great painting in the Sistine Chapel.

It's not that he doesn't
need to leave the prison.

Things would just be the same
for him whether he left or not.

With that body, he might
actually be safer in the cell.

More importantly, how did
he get through the door?

Bucciarati's told me all about you.

So you want to join our organization?

Hmm... Giorno Giovanna, was it?

Well, why don't we get
this interview started?

What the hell was that?

Did my eyes play a trick on me?

For a moment, it looked like he took a bite
out of his finger along with the cracker...

No... Maybe Polpo is also a Stand
user, just like Bucciarati.

Either way, I can't let him
find out that I'm one, as well.

What do you think is the
most important thing

when it comes to choosing
someone, Giorno Giovanna?

Is it what they're capable of?

Oh? And what exactly are you capable of?

I borrowed a few things when
she was patting me down.

I thought these would be useful for your test.

Of course, I'll be returning
them to her when I leave.

Do you have anything else?

Other than that, the only skill I have

is being able to completely
fold my ear into my head.

That's rather amusing.

But, you see...

There's something else
that's far more important,

and that's trust, Giorno Giovanna.

The most important thing when it
comes to choosing people is trust.

In comparison, being smart or
being talented means as much

as this piece of cracker between my teeth.

This test is all about seeing
how trustworthy you are...

with this lighter's flame.

Take it, and make sure the
flame doesn't go out.

Whoa, there.

Be extra careful to make sure
the flame doesn't go out.

Fuller, the 17th-century theologian, said,

"He's my friend that speaks
well of me behind my back."

In order to join our organization,

you'll have to show how trustworthy
you are when we can't see you.

For 24 hours, you will hold on to that
lighter without letting the flame go out.

If you can do that, I'll approve
of you joining the organization.

Simple, right?

The lighter has plenty of fluid in it.

All you have to do is sit quietly
in your room until 3 PM tomorrow

and make sure the flame doesn't go out.

If you're a careful man who'll work
hard to make sure it doesn't go out,

the flame shouldn't go out.

Which means you're someone we can trust.

However...

If you're a man who is
taking us too lightly,

and you fall asleep,
sneeze, or knock it over,

or a sudden wind blows the flame out...

It means that you're untrustworthy,

and I can't allow you to
join our organization.

Now, take the lighter.

This is your entrance exam.

You have 24 hours.

I'm looking forward to seeing you come
to visit me again tomorrow at 3 PM.

For 24 hours...

All visitors must go through another body
check when they go through the gate.

Once you're told that you
can leave the facility,

please continue to the next
room and grab your belongings.

Wait! Polpo didn't tell you anything?

What?

I'm going to pat you down now.

Let me remind you that it's prohibited
for you to accept anything from him!

Shit! I was under the impression
that Polpo bribed all these guys,

giving me permission to take
the lighter out of here!

Visitor, put your hands
up and proceed forward!

So Polpo's test for me
has already started...

And...

I have no choice but to go through with it!

I have to pass this test
and get into Passione!

Koichi Hirose

Reverb Act 3

Visitor, hurry forward!

Just like I hid her ID in my hand
where no one could see earlier,

Put your hands up and proceed forward!
I will conduct a body check!

I'll hide this flame!

You're free to go.

There are no problems here.

You may leave this facility.

However...

Please open up your hand.

Let me remind you that it's prohibited
to accept anything from him.

Visitor, open up your hand!
I'm going to check it.

A flower?

A real flower?

Very well. I'll allow you to take that out.

You are permitted to leave this facility.

I turned the lighter into a flower
and hid the flame within it.

That was too close.

But is this flame Polpo's Stand ability?

The wind's definitely bad news!

Hey, Giorno! Perfect timing!

Could you push the shutter
button on the camera?

No.

Sorry, but could you help me out here?

No.

I finally made it back to my dorm.

Th-That was close...

Now the lighter won't fall over,
and even if the air moves,

the flame will be protected.

Now, just as Polpo said, I just need to
watch over this for the next 23 hours.

I know.

I'll make sure my window
is locked, just in case.

I need to make sure it doesn't randomly
open and allow the wind to blow in here.

What?

Who's opening my door without even knocking?

Th-That's—

Looks like he's out.

Now's my chance.

It's that Japanese guy again!

His name was... Koichi Hirose!

How did he find out my address?

Looks like my suitcase and
belongings are long gone.

But my passport might still be around.

It's probably harder to sell someone's ID.

I feel like a thief, sneaking into
someone's room like this, but...

No! He's the thief here!

What's so wrong with trying
to find what belongs to me?!

His passport? Shit!

It's in the documents case
on top of my desk because

I'd planned to return it to him!

At this rate, Koichi's going
to see the lighter's flame!

Then he'll probably put it out!

He'll think it'll set the place on fire!

What should I do?

I have to hurry up and retrieve that lighter!

Golden Wind!

I used Golden Wind to turn
the light cord into a snake.

That bread is pretty delicious.

Good job biting into it!

Now I'll pull it up with the cord...

What? Shit!

I can't believe this.

He found the lighter.

This isn't good.

I have to make sure he doesn't
blow the flame out!

Oh?

This mark! The mark symbolizing Japan!

I found it! It's my passport!

I-It's burning!

Thank goodness...

Huh?

That's strange. I could've
sworn I saw a lit lighter...

That was close.

He almost extinguished the flame.

I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream!

And to take my first step toward that dream,

I have to protect this flame, no matter what!

Whoa, that was close.

Sorry about that. I was cleaning the stairs.

I'm glad it was just a slight mist and
the water didn't actually hit you.

This must mean we've both done
good things in our daily lives.

Your daily actions are very important.

If you weren't careful, you'd probably be
wearing that bucket of water on your head.

Seriously? This isn't good.

The flame...

I wonder if I can ask
Polpo to let me try again.

No...

If he were that forgiving,
he wouldn't have tested me with this.

Flame?

Is that lighter not lighting up anymore?

Is it broken? Is it my fault?

No, it wasn't you.

I'm actually trying to
process what happened...

But from what I can see,
it doesn't look broken.

The lighter is still letting gas out.

What did you just say?

Whoosh

Yes, there's still gas coming out.

Is this the switch?

Did you try pushing it?

No... It shouldn't be able to light.

But look at this fine craftsmanship!

This whole test depended on
if the flame was lit or not.

It's a very impressive lighter.

If I were able to just light it again,
there's be no point in this test!

I was startled by the size of the flame,
but it looks like it's working fine.

See?

By the way, since you have that lighter,
you're not smoking cigarettes, are you?

Something's wrong.

It actually lit up again...
There has to be something wrong!

What the...

That couldn't be his Sta—

You relit the lighter, didn't you?

I'll give you one more chance.
You have two possible paths.

Th-That's...

The first path is to live
and become a chosen one.

Your only other path is death.

A Stand!

That's gotta be Polpo's Stand!

There's no doubt about it!

You relit the lighter!

This is your fate!

No way! You bastard!
What the hell are you doing?!

This soul...

did not belong to one
who should be chosen.

One who should be chosen?

H-Hey, are you...

He's dead. He's uninjured, but he's dead...

Was it because...

That Stand pulls people's souls out
and kills them with an arrow?

Is that it?

But does "the one who should be chosen"

mean someone who can join the gang?

You relit the lighter, too, didn't you?

I'll give you one more chance.
You have two possible paths...

Episodio 04
Joining the GangSomething's wrong.

It actually lit up again...
There has to be something wrong!

You relit the lighter, didn't you?

No way! You bastard!
What the hell are you doing?!

This soul...

did not belong to one
who should be chosen.

One who should be chosen?

H-Hey, are you...

He's dead. He's uninjured, but he's dead...

You relit the lighter, too, didn't you?

I'll give you one more chance.
You have two possible paths...

So it indiscriminately attacks anyone
who happens to see the lighter relit.

Th-This is...

This bastard... He's dragging my soul

out of me through my shadow!

I'll give you one more chance.
You have two possible paths...

Episodio 04  Joining the Gang

The first path is to become a chosen one.

It's no use... It's stronger
than Golden Wind.

The old man died after his soul
was struck by that arrow.

So what's going to happen to me

if my Stand is attacked?

Your only other path is death.

Th-This arrow...

If I actually get stabbed by
that arrow, I'm dead for sure!

I've got no choice!

Even if Polpo is one of the capos,

if he's going to stand in my way

and even kill an innocent old man
like he was a piece of trash...

I have to defeat him!

Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

Golden Wind...

Only your senses will go berserk,
and all movements will look slow.

It's gone! That's impossible!

It shouldn't be able to control
its own movements right now.

Even if it were able to move,
it should be extremely slow.

It shouldn't be able to disappear!

It has to be around here somewhere...

It has to be!

I have to find it before the
slowed-time effect wears off,

or it'll attack me again.

What?!

F-From within the shadows?! Sh-Shit!

Its movements are slower,
but it's still just as powerful!

I can't move at all!

The shadows! It's in the shadows!

It can only move within the
shadows, but at amazing speed...

Looks like it can't follow
me into the sunlight.

But the sun's going to set on the
other side of the school soon.

Once that happens, I'll have nowhere to run.

What'll happen if I force
it out into the sunlight?

It's definitely worth trying.

But how am I going to drag it out?

What should I do? It's waiting right there.

It's waiting there patiently

for the sun to go down.

Hey!

What are you doing, Giorno Giovanna?!

Koichi!

Who's that guy collapsed
at the bottom of the stairs?!

What did you do to him?!

Hey, don't get the wrong idea!

That wasn't me!

That Stand right there atta—

The wrong idea?

I saw you talking to that old man!

I was watching from the window!

You were... watching?

Then... did you see the
lighter being relit, too?

Huh?

Don't step into the handrail's shadow, Koichi!

Get out of the shadows!

Sh-Shit!

You saw the lighter being relit, didn't you?

You have two possible paths.

Wh-What's going on?
The first path is to become a chosen one.

Your only other path is death.

This arrow is...

Golden Wind!

It hurts so much...

This hurts like hell, but now...

it looks like I was able to drag
you out into the sunlight.

I turned part of the handrail

into morning glories and let them hang down.

Now you're out of the handrail's shadow!

So close!

There were more shadows nearby,
so it managed to escape.

But it looks like if I can drag that
thing completely out into the sunlight,

I might be able to win.

Wh-What was...

What was that Stand?!

As you saw, it's trying to attack us.

The old man who relit
this lighter was killed.

Because we saw it being relit,

both you and I are now its targets.

That's not what I meant.

That arrow... It's from the Bow and Arrow!

I didn't know one was in Italy, too...

What are you doing, Giorno Giovanna?!

Is it because of you that another
Stand with the arrow appeared?!

It'll take too long to explain everything...

But I don't know anything.

Do you know something about that Stand?

And about that arrow?

Why did you save me?

Telling me about that
arrow is more important!

The sun's going to set!

Why did you save me?!

Don't you dare assume that I feel like
I owe a thief like you anything!

The lighter being lit is
because of something I did.

There was nothing I could've
done for that old man.

I feel awful about it.

I believe what I did was right,
but I feel dark and gross inside.

But despite that,

I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream
that I believe to be right.

Two years ago, I was shot with a similar
arrow and gained my Stand ability.

If the person shot with the arrow doesn't
awaken to that ability, they will die.

Awaken to the ability?

That's it!

That's what it meant by the "chosen one"!

Someone whose Stand awakened!

And that must be the motive
behind Polpo's test!

I don't know about the origin of the arrow,

but I've met a Stand very
similar to this one before.

It's a long-distance
remote-controlled Stand!

Long-distance and remote-controlled?

It can only carry out simple commands,

but it won't stop attacking
until it's fulfilled its motive.

Our best option is to find the
Stand user and take them down.

Sadly, that's not an option.

The user is in a jail cell.
We can't get to him.

Anyway,

that thing won't be able to leave
the school building's shadow,

so let's head into the sunlight
while it's still available.

Then, before the sun goes down,

we'll lure it into the shadow
of something that can move,

and then we'll get rid of that shadow.

That way, we can drag it into the sunlight.

Got it!

I-It's gone!

I've got you!

Wh-What?!

You saw the lighter being relit, didn't you?

The crows!

It hid in the shadows of those crows
and moved over there in them!

Th-This thing...

It's useless!

Sh-Shit!

While in the shadows, its power
and speed are much higher!

Act 3! 3 Freeze!

My Reverb Act 3's ability is to
make Stands or people heavier.

I've made its hands heavier,

so much that it won't be able
to lift a finger from the ground.

It should let go.

I made the entirety of its hands heavier!

It shouldn't be able to
bend its fingers anymore!

It's strong...

It's determined to not
let go, no matter what.

You have two possible paths...

I-It's no use!

Any damage inflicted upon the
Stand goes right back to the user!

At this rate, Giorno's
legs are going to break!

Act 3! Undo 3 Freeze...

No.

Don't do that, Koichi.

This ability that makes things heavier...
Don't you dare undo it.

This is perfect.

This is exactly the ability
that I was looking for!

But your leg's going to shatter!

Wh-What?

That tree...

Golden Wind is an ability
that continuously gives life,

so that tree continued to grow,
lived the extent of its life,

and is now starting to wither.

Ability?

But that tree's at least ten meters away...

So you got to the tree's
roots by digging that hole!

Bam

Y-You did it! The shadow's gone!

It's been dragged out into the daylight!

You told me there were two paths,

but sadly, you only have one.

Koichi, could you move
to the right a little?

Huh? Like this?

Hmm...

Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

Bask in the sunlight.

That's it.

That's your one possible path.

Still, I have to wonder

if I'm going to be able to join the gang now.

What to do...

Polpo
Shadow Sabbath

That arrow...

The fact that the Arrow
is also in Italy means

that there'll be even more victims!

I need to hurry up and tell Jotaro!

Wh-What are you doing?

Did you just say there'll be more?

We defeated Polpo's Stand,
which had the arrow.

You saw it for yourself.

Defeated? You've got this all wrong!

I'll admit that we managed to escape
its attacks because of you,

but that Stand only stopped
attacking because of the sunlight.

The user isn't hurt at all.
They're perfectly fine!

So Polpo's alive?

Not only that, but long-distance
remote-controlled Stands

basically don't affect their users at all.

He probably hasn't even realized
there's been a battle here.

What?

So he has no idea at all?

He doesn't know I'm a Stand user, either?

Chill out, would you?

If he noticed anything, it was probably
that his hand felt a bit heavier,

but he'd have no way of knowing
that you and I are Stand users.

Hey, could you move your finger?

Sorry, but I still can't
let you make your call.

I'm begging you...

This isn't just one enemy.
They're an organization.

If you tell someone,
the organization might find out.

Enemy?

Organization?

I'll tell you and only you, Koichi.

The Next Day

Someone gifted me a special-order pizza.

Sorry to keep you waiting.
Let's see, you were...

Giorno... Giorno, uh...

Giorno Giovanna.

Ah, yes. Sorry about that.

My head goes blank when I eat.

Perhaps it's because all my
blood goes to my stomach.

This might sound sudden, but are
you a religious person, Giorno?

I'm not sure... but I'm not
very passionate about it.

What I'm about to say may
contradict God's teachings,

but I'd like you to listen carefully.

If the most important thing
in this world is trust,

the most despicable thing you
can do is insult someone.

Listen well... To insult
or betray someone's trust

not only hurts their reputation,

but puts them in a very sticky situation.

We will not fight others or risk
our lives over money, power,

or having our seats taken
at a theater or on the bus.

Fighting is truly foolish.
Only idiots bother with it.

But...

I will risk my life over being insulted.

I believe that God forgives even murder.

Don't forget that.

Congratulations! I will allow
you to enter the organization.

You did bring me the lighter still
lit, as I trusted you would.

You pass.

That's our Passione organization's badge.

It proves that you passed.

You'll be working under
Bucciarati for a while.

How about it? Why don't we celebrate your...

Did that brat actually protect
the flame for 24 hours?

Or did he relight it and
become a Stand user?

I couldn't care less about that.

Young, clueless guys like him are easy to use.

Either way, we can use him however we want.

Oh?

I could've sworn I closed that...

The blood does flow to my
stomach after I've eaten...

You met him again?

I'm sorry, Jotaro.

But I can't help thinking

that he, Giorno Giovanna, isn't as
dangerous as you think he might be.

What makes you think that?

Well...

Well, I'll tell you that in person.

Is that all right?

All right.

If that's what you want to do, that's fine.

I'll be waiting.

Thank you.

I'll talk to you later.

Jotaro, back then, I really did think...

Does this Giorno kid really admire that?

Is he sane?

But I can feel it...

I can feel that he has a righteous heart.

I can tell...

Because I observed three members of
the Joestar bloodline back in Morioh.

The three who exude righteousness from
their hearts, as if it were their life energy.

I could see the same thing in his eyes.

Without a doubt, the blood that flows in
his veins carries the will of the Joestars.

So I'm going to keep this to myself
for a while, like he asked...

The golden dream that Giorno
Giovanna possesses.

Well, then, maybe I'll
go do some sightseeing.

The Next Day

Come with me, Giorno Giovanna.

What was that noise?

Well, whatever.

When someone insults you,
even murder is forgivable?

I see. What you told me is very important.

You insulted that innocent old man's life.

So I changed one of your guns into a banana.

You should savor your
last meal as best you can.

So... Where are we going?

I'll introduce you to my team.

They're all Stand users.

Episodio 05
Find Polpo's Fortune!Passione is a pretty big gang organization.

First, there are groups made up of
six to ten underlings, like my team.

Then there are capos like
Polpo who command those teams.

They reign over a particular
region, making it their turf.

These teams include specialty teams, such
as an assassination team and a drug team.

Despite being from the same gang,

I really don't want to involve myself
with those teams or their capos.

And the one who stands
at the top is the boss.

The boss only has contact with the trusted
subordinate he considers his right hand,

and we have no way of
knowing who or where he is.

Gang members in this
city hate standing out,

as it can quickly lead
to their assassination.

So even the capos will dress
normally to blend in with the crowd,

and some even have cover jobs.

That goes double for our boss.
He won't reveal his identity to anyone.

If we go snooping around,
we're detected immediately.

I know plenty of guys this has happened to.

So, Giorno, in order for us to
get close to our mysterious boss,

we need to be acknowledged.

We can't defeat the boss unless
we earn the acknowledgement

and trust of someone close to the boss.

So first, we're going to get stronger.

We have to climb up
to the position of capo.

Of course, the two of us can't do that alone.

A team we can trust...

That's what we'll need to defeat the boss.

Episodio 05 Find Polpo's Fortune!

The news of the incarcerated Polpo's
death spread among the other capos.

According to our intelligence
team, it might've been suicide.

That's not his style.

Polpo was in a special cell.
Murder isn't possible.

Maybe he was plotting to betray the boss.

There aren't many capos
as trustworthy as him.

That's even less believable.

More importantly...

Yeah... The problem is his successor.

How do I look?

Rome 10:05 a.m.

I just heard that the capos are freaking out.

Apparently, Polpo committed suicide.

Huh?

Hey, watch where you're going!

I'm fine.

Suicide? That fatso?

I told you to watch where you're going!

So I dunno if Polpo was sad because he was in
prison or if his obesity made him depressed,

but he apparently wasn't very strong mentally.

He put his own gun in his
mouth and blew his brains out.

You sure it was suicide and not murder?

It was suicide, for sure.
From the... autopsy, they call it?

Any expert can tell if it
was a suicide or murder.

Hey, there's a light up ahead.

More importantly, have you heard
the rumors about Polpo's fortune?

Rumors?

I don't know where the end of the universe is,
and I don't know jack about that, either.

Before Polpo went to prison,

he converted some of his
fortune into jewels and gold

and hid them somewhere.

He has a hidden fortune.

It's too much to even deposit in the bank,
and he kept it secret from the organization.

No one was stupid enough to look
for it while Polpo was alive.

But now that he's dead,
that fortune doesn't belong to anyone.

It's free money.

It's said to be worth about five billion lire.

Five billion?

If I had that much money,

I'd be heading to Monaco or
Japan with a girl on each arm.

Nah, I'd rather work my way up.

If I can climb up to capo with that money,
I can taste honey that's even sweeter.

But who knows where it's hidden...

No one knows?

Nah, and this is just what I'm thinking...

But Polpo was such a fatty,
he couldn't even go outside on his own.

Do you think he could hide a fortune
worth five billion on his own?

He must've had someone do it for him.

Someone who's good at
keeping their mouth shut...

Though I'm not sure anyone
like that actually exists.

But Polpo liked Bucciarati.

Bucciarati? That's one of the
thugs from Naples, right?

Yeah. If anyone could've hidden it, it's him.

And now that Polpo's dead,
Bucciarati should be making his move...

to get the five billion lire
that's just been freed up.

I'm sure that even Bucciarati wants money.

Hey, Zucchero!

That bastard Zucchero actually left!

Did he seriously believe that?

If you're actually going to trail
Bucciarati, I'd be careful.

Apparently, he and his
subordinates are Stand users.

Naples 11:26 a.m.

Hey, Fugo.

It's such a nice day outside.

It wouldn't hurt to skip out
on studying for one day.

I'm just not feeling it today.

Thank you for waiting.
Here's your strawberry cake.

Listen, Narancia.

Set it there.

Yes, sir.
You're amazing.

It's hard to ask someone
to teach you something

when you haven't really
even been to grade school.

But you even learned your multiplication tables!

You can do this. Just do as I've taught you.

You've got a good head on your shoulders.

Okay, ready? What's six times five?

Six times five... Six and five...

Thirty?

Correct! See? I knew you could do it!

You're basically halfway there!

I see! Six times five is thirty! Okay!

Hey, what's the deal with this?!

What do you mean? It's strawberry cake.

Yeah, I can see that by looking at it!

It's obviously not chocolate
cake or cheesecake!

That's not the point here!

There are four slices of cake!

Do they want me to die?!

Again with this, Mista?

You moron!

It's bad luck to choose one from four!

Choosing from five is fine.

Choosing from three is fine.

But when you choose from four,
something bad will happen!

When I was a kid, another
kid adopted a kitten from

a litter of four that was
born in our neighborhood,

and then the cat scratched
his eye right out of his head!

Of course, he beat the cat to death later.

That's just an old wives' tale.

If you think about it rationally,

when people eat a cake one slice at a time,

someone's going to have to
take one of the last four slices.

That's the thing, though!

This is when the restaurant should be more
considerate and just bring us three slices!

Talk about shitty service!

Jeez... Don't eat it, then.

But I want some strawberry cake!

I did it!

I did it, Fugo! How's it look?

You're finished? Let's have a look.

What is this?

Am I right?

Crunch

You stupid delinquent!
Are you messing with me?!

How many times do I have to
teach you this before you learn?!

You shit-for-brains!

Oh, boy. He's lost it now.

You just said six times five was thirty,
so why the hell is your answer even less?!

Hey, Abbacchio, are you gonna eat that cake?

What?

Did you just call me shit-for-brains?

It's not good to look down on others.

I'll kill you. I'll kill you, Fugo.

You bastard...

What the hell are you guys doing?!

I could hear you all the
way from the entrance!

You're bothering the other customers!

This is the new member
I told you about yesterday.

Let me introduce you.
This is Giorno Giovanna.

I'm Giorno Giovanna.

It's a pleasure to meet you.

I'm sorry, Fugo.

No, I should apologize.

Please forgive me, Narancia.

I'll study even harder, so teach me again.

Hey!

I'm the one who brought him
here, so be respectful!

Mr. Bucciarati.

What is it?

There's a phone call for you.

All right, thanks.

Make sure you guys properly
greet Giorno! Got it?

Giorno, I'll be right back.

Take some time to get to know these guys.

All right.

Giorno, was it?

Why don't you have a seat?

Let's have some tea and chat.

Here you go, Mr. Bucciarati.

Thanks.

This is Bucciarati.

All right.

Is something wrong?

No.

Bucciarati! Bucciarati, do you have a second?

Oh, hello, Ms. Menini.

What's the matter?

I'd like to ask a favor.
Could we talk outside?

Of course.

Well, drink up.

How old are you?

Fifteen.

Fifteen? Ha, you're two
years younger than me.

Thank you for the tea.

What's wrong?

You just thanked me for the tea that
I so generously poured for you.

Since you already thanked me for
it, you'll just have to drink it.

Or do you not want to drink
it since it's not very hot?

Maybe he doesn't want to drink it because
he doesn't want to be one of us.

What the hell are you guys doing?!

It's nothing.

He went to the trouble
of pouring this tea for me.

No freakin' way!

What did you guys do?

Gross! He actually drank it!

D-Dude, you're hilarious!
Did you seriously drink it?

No, there's no way he could have!

Hey, how'd you do it? Where'd you hide it?

Hey, come on. Just tell me! Okay?

Who knows?

You're all keeping your abilities
secret, too, aren't you?

So he's a Stand user?

What I did with the liquid in the cup is...

I used my ability to change one
of my teeth into a jellyfish,

which is 98 percent liquid, to suck it up.

Is it, like, some ability to move things?

Open your mouth.
There's no hole in there, is there?

You actually drank it for real?

I'm not sure what it is,

Was that your favorite or something?
but there's something about Giorno Giovanna
that makes him hard to dislike.

If you guys tell me about your
powers, I might tell you mine.

You're cautious. I respect that.

Does Bucciarati know?

Yeah.

They're not exactly a team yet,
but we don't have any time to wait.

This has to be decided now.

Quit screwing around. We're going out.

Huh? Where?

Follow me and you'll find out. Hurry it up.

Bucciarati! How are you?

Oh, Mr. Bucciarati!

Hey, Bucciarati.

Come by my shop again sometime!

I will!

Hey, what are we going to do about a car?

We got a loaner.

Since a certain someone
destroyed our last one.

As I suspected, the citizens trust him.

Hey, I told you that wasn't my fault!

Bucciarati, this is my friend,

and she's in a bit of trouble
because her son is beating her.

Right?

I see. That's rough.

I'll give him a talking-to.

What's your son's name?

Thank you.

He's usually such a sweet boy.

But lately, he's been getting into drugs...

Bucciarati, I've been living in
this neighborhood for fifty years.

But lately, I've been so anxious.

Who's making them sell those drugs?

I'm so scared.

Hey, you're going to protect
us, aren't you, Bucciarati?

You're on our side, right?

Yeah... I'll take care of it.

I'll figure it out.

We're going cruising on a yacht?

That's awesome!

When did you get a yacht?

We're going to rent one.

Huh?

Aw, it's just a rental.

Say, Bucciarati...

Whatever you do, please don't
rent that one with the number 4.

It'll sink. I know it.

Oh, come on... If that were the case,
it wouldn't be floating there now.

Shut up!

Then you can ride on that one!

We'd like to rent a yacht.

Of course! You can use whichever one you like.

Other than 4!

All right. Sir, I'd like the one on the far left.

All right. Let me get you the key.

For now, I'd like to rent it for three days.
How much will that cost?

Oh, I could never ask you
for money, Mr. Bucciarati!

Use it as long as you'd like.

Thanks.

Ring me up, pops!

This feels nice.

Hey, Narancia... Hey!

Huh?

Well, uh, you know...

You bought drinks, didn't you?
Would you sell me one?

What? You always say that, but you never pay!

Oh, who cares? Gimme one!
Come on, hurry! Gimme!

You're so helpless.

You want a cola or Sparite?

I'll take a co— Actually,
a Sparite, since it's clear.

Here you go.

Thanks. Could you hold this magazine for me?

Thanks, and thanks again...

Huh? What's wrong with this thing?
It just stopped working!

Why'd it stop?

I just bought it!

Damn it! How dare he sell
me something like this?!

That stupid old guy from the electronics
store is gonna regret this!

Hey!

Come on, Bucciarati! Hurry up and
tell us where this boat's headed!

Fine. We're far enough
away from the shore now.

We're headed to Capri.

Capri?

We're not going there as tourists, are we?

Correct.

Then why are we going there?

This morning, the capo
Polpo committed suicide.

What? Suicide?! Polpo did?

No way!

But why?

It doesn't matter why he died.

Polpo was a capo who did
things that'd get him killed.

But what does he have to do
with why we're going to Capri?

Polpo actually has a secret fortune.

It's worth...

ten billion lire!

T-Ten billion?

I'm the only person who
knows where it's hidden.

I'm the one he ordered to hide it.

That ten billion now belongs to us!

With that money, we can
claim the rank of capo!

A-Awesome!

He's definitely a man
who's going to the top.

Just like I thought,
he's going to become a capo!

He earned this opportunity

by working diligently enough to be
acknowledged and liked by a capo.

Amazing.

Seriously? This took a
sudden turn for the awesome.

Where is it?

Where'd you hide that kind of
fortune on Capri, Bucciarati?

I can't tell you that yet.

Rumors of his hidden fortune have
made the rounds in the organization.

No one can find out before
we secure the money.

B-Bucciarati!

Hey! Something's wrong!

Did something happen, Narancia?

Narancia!

What the heck are you doing?

H-Hey, come look at this!

There's only one shoe left...

Give that here, Giorno!

I don't quite understand what's going on.

Where did Narancia go?

You guys didn't see it?

To me, it looked like Narancia
got pulled into this box.

What?

That's impossible!

He didn't randomly fall
into the ocean, did he?

Narancia, where are you?

Hey, Narancia! If you're just
fooling around and hiding... Hup!

Hurry up and answer us!

Narancia, where are you?

Narancia! Answer us!

Mista?

What are you doing, Mista?

Mista?

Where did you go, Mista?

It can't be...

Come on, Mista!

Why are you messing around now—

Fugo?

Hey, Fugo!

What?

What's going on?

Abbacchio, Giorno, stay close to each other!

We're being attacked!

There's someone hiding
somewhere on this boat!

This is a Stand attack!

But why now?

The money.

Someone found out that I
knew where the money was,

and they're trying to steal it.

Which means they're from the organization.

Does that mean they've been quietly tracking
us ever since we were on the shore?

Looks that way.

They probably grew impatient because
I wouldn't just say where the money is.

They intend to get rid of everyone but me,
then make me cough up the location.

And they can take their time, since we're
on the ocean with nowhere to run.

Are you saying Narancia
and the others are dead?

I didn't say that.

But it's for ten billion.

They'd even kill someone from
their own organization for that.

No, Narancia and the others are alive.

They're somewhere on this boat.

I don't know if this person is
trying to use them as hostages,

but they're alive.

Giorno Giovanna,

how the hell can you be so sure about that?

I used my Stand to turn
Narancia's shoe into a fly.

The fly is trying to return
to its owner, Narancia.

If Narancia was truly dead, it wouldn't
be flying around searching like that.

Can you locate him?

He's alive... He's alive, but...

It's not going down into
the cabin or in the locker.

The fly's not trying to stop...

It keeps flying around that
area looking for Narancia.

What the hell is his ability?

Just shut up and listen.

Narancia is somewhere near
the entrance to the cabin.

That's a fact.

But for some reason, the fly
can't find him, so it's lost.

I think it's safe to assume that we'll
find the enemy wherever Narancia is.

Which means the enemy isn't just
randomly hiding behind something.

I see.

So if we don't figure out the
mystery behind the enemy's ability,

getting too close without
knowing could get us killed.

Correct.

But the fact that their ability requires them
to attack while hidden is a shortcoming.

If we can figure out the mystery behind
it, we'll be able to defeat them.

Abbacchio, your Stand...

might be perfect to defeat such an enemy.

Defeat?

Can you solve this mystery with your ability?

Hard to say...

Damn it, Abbacchio!

You'd better not be hung up on
stupid shit at a time like this!

Stupid shit?

No.

This has to do with my safety.

I can't just carelessly reveal my Stand ability

in front of a stranger that I can't trust.

Bucciarati,

I don't know what made you trust this guy,

but I don't consider him a part of the team.

If we don't figure out the enemy's
location, we're going to be killed!

And I'm saying that's just this
untrustworthy brat's hypothesis.

He just came up with it out of fear.
He didn't see anything.

Abbacchio!

The enemy is just hiding
somewhere in the cabin.

I'll find them and take care of them.

If we get close without figuring out
the mystery, we're going to get kil—

Shut your mouth!

You stupid little brat...

I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream.

What are you talking about?

You can solve the mystery, right?

I'm counting on you!

Giorno!

What the hell are you doing?!

Roar

G-Giorno!

There's an enemy over there!

Shit!

Giorno's in trouble!

Abbacchio...

Giorno Giovanna... You're one crazy bastard.

All this to prove yourself...

What the hell is wrong with you?

Episodio 06
Moody Jazz's CounterattackLeone Abbacchio became a police officer
after graduating from high school.

This was due to his strong sense of justice.

But soon after he became a
police officer, his lifelong dream,

Abbacchio realized there were many
contradictions that came with this job.

The police were supposed to
risk their lives to save others,

while those very people they
were risking their lives to protect

were the ones who were stealing,
injuring others in hit-and-runs,

Hey, you two!

and throwing rocks at police cars,
breaking their windshields.

Honey!

Are you all right?

Hey, you!

You're a cop, aren't you?!

The masses were unappreciative,

demanding, and irresponsibly
discredited and insulted the police,

asking, "What are the police even doing?!"

Even if the police risked their lives to
arrest criminals who were lower than scum,

"Serial Burglar Isacco Finally Arrested!"

"A Whole Group Wiped Out"

the law for the masses was rather
lenient as long as they had money,

"Isacco Released
on 70 Million Lire"
"Victims Furious"

and they would be released.

Quit causing us so much trouble.

My bad.

It doesn't matter now.

We just have to find more people to rip off.
Eventually, Abbacchio started to
learn from these contradictions.

Come on, Officer.

Cut us some slack.

That girl's father is swimming
in debt, so she needs the cash.

It's not like we're hurting anyone.

Hey, are you done yet?

I've got a client waiting.

I know, I know.

Even if I were to arrest them,
they'd just post bail and be released.

The only difference is they pay either
me or the court and their lawyers.

You're a very passionate man,

and a very passionate police officer.

One night, they received a report
that a shop was being robbed.

Abbacchio! Go around the back.

Freeze! You're under arrest!

H-Hey, it's you.

Looks like I messed up.

You're...

He's been shot in the head.

Hey, couldn't you just pretend
that you didn't see me?

Come on, let me go.

I won't cause you any more trouble.

No! You're under arrest!

Come on, think this through...

If I get arrested, the fact that you took
a bribe from me will get out, too.

That gun's really dangerous...

Could you point it somewhere else?

Abbacchio! He has a gun!

Ow! It hurts, God damn it!

I'm gonna die...

I'm gonna die...

I'm gonna die...

I'm really gonna die...

That moment was the end of Abbacchio's future.

Not only was he charged
for being a dirty cop,

but he allowed his partner to
die because of his actions,

and that was a cross he'd have
to bear for the rest of his life.

It was then that his body and
soul plunged into darkness.

No matter who died, or even
if he lost a limb or two,

his heart would probably
never be moved again.

Abbacchio, wasn't it?

Episodio 06  Moody Jazz's Counterattack

You can solve the mystery, right?

I'm counting on you!

Giorno!

What the hell are you doing?!

Roar

G-Giorno!

Giorno's in trouble!

Giorno Giovanna...

You're one crazy bastard.

All this to prove yourself...

What the hell is wrong with you?

Y-You bastard...

Th-This Stand...

Use your Golden Wind to defend yourself!

I-Impossible!

Giorno... Where are you?!

Don't go down there, Bucciarati.

Actually, stay back.

It's not that I trust Giorno
Giovanna as one of us,

but Giorno seems to believe
that you won't abandon him.

He does some pretty crazy shit.

Giorno Giovanna...

What if that had actually killed you?

So, again, Bucciarati, don't go down there.

Th-That fly...

Narancia's shoe...

Giorno's powers haven't disappeared yet.

Does that mean Giorno's alive?

They're here, Bucciarati!

Narancia and the enemy are below deck!

Zipper Man!

Narancia, Fugo, Mista, and Giorno aren't here!

Maybe they're right under where the fly is.

It's just like Giorno said.

The enemy's not just hiding in some
locker or behind something to attack...

Hey. The fly's coming around now.

That's strange...

Where is the enemy going?

How and where is the enemy hiding?

Regarding this enemy's abilities...

I hate to admit it, but it looks like I'll
have to accept what Giorno was saying.

I'll use my Stand to solve this mystery!

But... This spot's bad news, Bucciarati!

Moody Jazz!

Does Narancia from five minutes ago work?

Yeah. That should be fine.

Is the fly all right?

It's heading toward the bow.

Now's our chance. Do it quickly.

Yeah.

What's that noise?

His headphones.

Five minutes ago, Narancia was
listening to his boombox.

Huh? What's wrong with this thing?
It just stopped working!

Why'd it stop?
This isn't it.

I just bought it!

Narancia was attacked a little after this.

Damn it! How dare he sell
me something like this?!

I'll try fast forwarding and searching.

That stupid old guy from the electronics
store is gonna regret this!

That ten billion now belongs to us!

With that money, we can
claim the rank of capo!

A-Awesome!

Where is it?
That was my voice.

Where'd you hide that kind of
fortune on Capri, Bucciarati?

It was right after this conversation
that Narancia was attacked!

I can't tell you that yet.

We'd better be able to see just how
he was attacked, Abbacchio.

My Stand replays everything.

We'll be able to see everything,
from Narancia's sweat to his pulse.

And it'll follow him everywhere.

It's about time.

Let's get behind Narancia.

He's about to be attacked!

L-Look! It's the same wound Giorno had!

Roar!

It's coming!

Th-This is...

He's deflating like a balloon losing air!

Mario Zucchero

Tender Machine

Air is leaking from his wound, deflating him.

Looks like we know what
the enemy's abilities are now.

He's being pulled in!

Pause it, Abbacchio!

I see... So he's inside the pipe.

This is the answer to our mystery.

His nails, flesh, and bones are
all floppy like a condom,

even his shoe and his belt buckle,

but he still has a pulse.

Just like Giorno said, he's alive.

So that's what's going on...

The enemy is also doing this to his own body,

hiding in pipes or between the planks or walls,

and he's dragged in Mista,
Fugo, and Giorno, as well.

That explains why Giorno's fly
can trace the general area,

but can't pinpoint exactly where they are.

We figured out the enemy's ability.

Now all we have to do is chase the enemy,

find out where Narancia and the
others are and save them,

and then beat the shit out of the guy.

I'm resuming Moody Jazz's replay.

Chase? Wait a second, Abbacchio!

While you're replaying, you can't attack or
defend yourself. You're totally defenseless!

It's dangerous to go into the pipe.

I know exactly where Moody Jazz is going.

When that bastard is near, use your
zippers to open the floor and get him!

We can't defeat the enemy if we
don't chase him, Bucciarati!

It went left.

That's where he got Mista.

Moody Jazz is going right
underneath that ring buoy.

It's going around toward the cabin
where it got Fugo and Giorno.

So the enemy is moving them around
while keeping them captured.

It's moving much slower...

That's where the bastard
was hiding earlier.

On the inside of that rope fastener!

The enemy's right below the deck there!

The enemy's coming for us.

I'm not sure if he knows that
we know his ability, but...

Bring it on!

The pipes! Cut through them
and get them outta there!

Zipper Man!

Th-They're not there!

Where's the enemy, Abbacchio?

Where's your Moody Jazz? Where are they?

Right there.

It's my Stand. I know where it is.

It's right around there.

Right around where?

I'm telling you, right where you opened up!

My Moody Jazz is definitely right there!

Where are they?

Where are they?

Impossible... It's definitely right here.

Does this mean there's a mystery
we haven't solved yet?

This isn't good!

Undo the replay and call your Stand back!

I already did.

Something's wrong...

What wall is this?

Where the hell are you?

Did you hear that, Bucciarati?

That's the sound of the inside of a pipe.

We can't see it, but Moody Jazz
is definitely right there...

inside the pipe.

What are you doing?

The enemy's right there!

The pipe's wide open, but it's in the pipe...

It's coming closer...

So it's right here...

We need to run!

Run?

That Giorno Giovanna, whom I hate,
told me to solve this mystery.

He's an annoying little brat,

but I'm going to solve it!

Abbacchio...

It's coming!

There's one more mystery
surrounding this enemy.

I'm finally starting to see it.

I'll solve this and kill that bastard!

That awkward feeling I got
when I saw the mast...

Back then...

Bzzzzzz

It's right there! Call back your Stand!

I've figured out the other mystery!

Abbacchio...

Kill him... Bucciarati!

This mystery...

The place the enemy's hiding...

You're being dragged in! Grab on to me!

Damn it!

He's not there...

Where did he go?

What?

You bastard...

Where did you take Abbacchio?!

He's not in the cabin or
the drainage pipe...

Where are you hiding
Abbacchio and the others?!

The fact that there are
seagulls flying around...

must mean we're getting close to shore.

Looks like you're finally
all alone, Bucciarati.

You bas—

Oh, hang on one sec.

Ah, ah, ah!

I'm the one who's gonna
do the talking here.

Shut your trap until I tell you
to answer my questions, damn it!

Very good.

I can finish you off at any time,
and your crew is still alive,

but in suspended animation.

You should be grateful.

I could've killed them and
thrown them into the sea,

all chopped up nicely so the
fishies could eat them easier.

Depending on your actions, I may even
consider turning your crew back to normal.

All you have to do is tell me
where Polpo's secret fortune is!

Are you from Passione?

You really...

don't get it at all.

I'll murder you, you little shit!

Listen up! All you're allowed
to say is where the money is!

Just try and utter any other word
from that asshole of a mouth!

For every word you say,
I'll kill one of your friends!

Say, "What?" and I'll kill them!

Stay silent, and I'll kill them!

If I find out you're lying later,
I'll kill them again!

Got it?

Speak cautiously and very carefully.

Now, then, let me ask you...

Where's the money hidden?

Black-tailed gulls.

Sorry, where?

Those aren't seagulls.

They're black-tailed gulls.

How do you tell them apart?

The ones that sound like they're
meowing are black-tailed gulls.

You called them seagulls, but you were wrong.

They're black-tailed gulls.

I'm gonna kill one now!

Just try it! Better hope you
don't get dragged down!

Wh-What the hell are you doing?!

I didn't punch the deck earlier
to find where Abbacchio was.

It was to put a hole in
the bottom of the boat.

A h-hole?!

Abbacchio figured out where you were,

and he was kind enough to show me...

where you are and how to know for sure.

It was Abbacchio's blood.

Abbacchio intentionally hurt his hand
and showed me the blood trail.

The blood trail didn't
go down below the deck!

It was cut off right on the deck!

So what does that mean,
and where was he dragged to?

I rented the yacht that was on the left.

Abbacchio realized that when
he looked up at the sky.

I know where you are,
so if you don't wanna drown,

you'd best come out.

There were two boats!

Bwaaaaa

You bastard...

You were hiding by thinly covering
this yacht with another one.

You were traveling through the thin gap
between them and attacking us from there.

No wonder we couldn't figure it
out. You get points for that.

Stay back, Bucciarati!

I'll kill your friends!

You should know better than anyone that

you couldn't survive in a gang if a measly
little threat like that scared you.

Give up, and I'll forgive you.

But the moment you stab Abbacchio...

I will end your life.

Fwip

It's just as Giorno said.

The fact that you had to hide
to attack is your weakness.

You're way too slow.

Pop

Abbacchio!

Well done...

Abbacchio,

what's important isn't the end result.

It's how you get there.

Join my team.

Don't die bound by your past.

Episodio 07
Six Bullets Appears, Part 1O-Ow! Hey, right here...

Hey, Fugo... Could you
take a look right here?

Oh, dear. You've definitely got one.

It's pretty big.

Ow! That hurts!

Quit it! Don't touch it!

God damn it, you bastard!

You're gonna pay for
that, you piece of shit!

I've got a bump on my head because of you!

I hope you're prepared!

Take this! And this!

Seriously! Who do you think you are?!

You bastard!

Hey, something fell off him.

Let's see...

Mario Zucchero. His home address is in Rome.

So he's a gangster from Rome.

So is that thing on your face garbage?

Or is it a piece of seaweed?

It looks like it could be seaweed, but it
also looks like it could be a piece of plastic.

It'd break my heart if
it's actually garbage,

because it'd mean that this
beautiful ocean is polluted.

Mind if I take a closer look at it?

Hey.

I asked you if you'd mind if
I took a closer look at that.

Answer me when I ask you
a question, would you?

Capri.

When the ancient Greeks colonized
various lands in the Mediterranean Sea,

they looked for places with the
most beautiful scenery in the world.

One of those locations happened to be Capri.

Its blue sea, its sparkling sky...

But in sharp contrast,
it also had a shoreline

made up of white precipices,
making it look like a fortress.

During the age of the Roman Empire,
there was an emperor who made

this island his vacation home and
didn't return to Rome for ten years.

Bruno Bucciarati and his crew
are about to land on this island

in order to claim Polpo's secret
fortune of ten billion lire.

Episodio 07 Six Bullets Appears, Part 1

Bucciarati, let's start to
make a course toward land.

I've been looking for a while now,
but there isn't a single boat following us.

No one should know that this
boat is heading to Capri.

Yeah, there are no boats, but...

The problem is whoever that guy
heard about the secret fortune from.

I have a hard time believing
he followed us on his own.

You seem very interested in these,
but they're not mine.

They were inside the boat.

Which would you prefer me to use?

The glasses or the fishing line?

We need some answers from you.

If we don't get some, we'll be in danger.

You have a partner,
don't you, Mr. Zucchero?

And they're also a Stand user, aren't they?

That's why I'll be using these.

You don't even want to bother telling
me which one you'd like me to use?

If you won't pick one...

I'll just have to use both!

Well? Do you feel like talking now?

Ma-ri-o Zuc-che-ro. Heaven, Hell,
or the 9th Circle of Hell...

Heaven, Hell, or...

The 9th Circle of Hell!

He's headed for the 9th Circle of Hell,
according to this name divination!

If you're not going to tell us the name of

your partner who's coming after
us and their Stand ability...

You should probably start worrying
about your other eye, Mr. Zucchero!

Quit playing around, you dumbasses.

Damn it, come here and look at this.

He was using the radio on the boat.

Sounds like you found something
with Moody Jazz's replay.

Let's have a look.

This whole boat was flat,
but we'll be able to see him

in 3-D now that it's back to normal.

Giorno!

I have no intention of showing you my Stand!

Turn around.

I'll do you a favor and let
you hear its voice, at least.

When I was watching the replay of him,
he started using the boat's radio.

He's contacting someone.

I've already made four of them my hostages.

All that's left is Bucciarati and one other.

I'll have this taken care of in no time.

They were heading...

to Capri!

They haven't mentioned where
the money's hidden, though.

Hey, what do we do about this?

He told them where we're heading!

After I get rid of his five friends,
I'm gonna make Bucciarati cough it up. Over.

Was that yacht named Lagoon?

What's your current location?

We're about two hours out from Capri.

Bucciarati is wary of anyone following him,
so he's taking a very roundabout route.

Got it.

I'll take a high-speed boat
and wait for you at Capri.

Dock at Marina Grande. Over and out.

That's the end of the conversation.
The radio cut off.

How could this be?

This isn't good. With a high-speed vessel,

they can get from Naples
to Capri in thirty minutes!

That means they're definitely
already on the island!

Who is it? Who the hell was on the radio?

I'm going to make this guy tell
us who it is, no matter what!

No, he's a hardcore gangster.

It'll probably take some time
to get anything out of him.

He probably won't say anything today.

Besides, he might not know what
his partner's Stand looks like.

It's very possible his partner's
kept it secret even from him.

Then what are we supposed to do?

What if we just come ashore like this?

If they find out we're the ones on
this boat instead of Zucchero...

Also, if this boat doesn't arrive at
Marina Grande in about an hour...

They guy on the radio is sure to think
something happened to Zucchero.

If that happens, who knows if
we'll be able to get the money?

In fact...

I have my doubts we'd make it
back to Naples in one piece!

What are we going to do, Bucciarati?

There's no time to hesitate.

We should at least outfox the guy.

I'll somehow get to the island first and—

Before this boat docks,

all we need is someone to head to the
island first and get rid of the guy.

What the hell are you talking about?

Are you sure you're not stupid?

Get to the island before this boat?

What are we supposed to do? Swim there?

Yes.

Huh?!

I can change this ring buoy into a fish.

If I have it pull me, I'll be able to get
to the island faster than this boat.

Of course, since it's my Stand,
I'll be the one going.

I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream.

I want that ten billion lire.

We have to use that money
to make Bucciarati a capo

and move our way up the ranks.

Giorno...

You're going to go? All right, fine.

You've got some good ideas, boy.

But sadly, you don't know this
guy's name or what he looks like.

Capri is filled with tourists.

How the hell are you going to find him?

I agree with Giorno's plan.

Even if we don't know who this guy is...

If he's waiting for Zucchero
to arrive in this boat,

I think there's a high possibility
that we can attack first

rather than wait for him to attack.

So how many people can
that fish pull, Giorno?

My Stand, Six Bullets, is made for killing.

It's perfect for situations like this.

I'll be going, too.

Six Bullets

Guido Mista

It took us quite a while to swim
from the yacht to the island.

We have 20 minutes before the time

Zucchero was supposed to meet
up with the man on Capri.

That's about all the time we have left.

Giorno, how does the marina look?

Not good.

Just as Abbacchio said,
there are a lot of tourists.

And they all look like they're
waiting for someone.

They're probably just waiting
for sightseeing vessels, but...

Mista, you have a plan to find the
guy among that crowd of tourists

in the next 20 minutes, right?

What... are you doing?

It's way past lunchtime.

I'd prefer to go to that
restaurant over there,

but it's probably a bad idea
to have lunch at a restaurant

right in front of the marina.

I don't know what this guy looks like,

but he probably knows what I look
like since I'm on Bucciarati's team.

That goes for you, too.

I have no idea what you're talking about,

but listen, Mista.

I know we said about 20 minutes,

but if he's the panicky type,
we might only have about ten.

Maybe even five.

He may get suspicious when the
Lagoon doesn't come into port

and figure out that something
happened to Zucchero.

If that happens, we won't
have a chance to find him.

We have to make our move imme—

And I told you, this is my lunchtime!

Lunchtime is for lunch!

Even boutiques and bookstores in
this country honor lunchtime.

No one works if they don't have their lunch.

I'm not saying I'm like that,

but these little guys pretty much expect it.

Lunchtime!

Give us food!

Here you go, guys. Lunch is served.

Tuscan salami is delicious!

Delicious!

This is the best!

Hey, gimme that!

Hey, come on now, Number 3!

Stop making Number 5 cry!

Stop fighting. There's enough for all of you.

They all believe that they do the most work,

so they have the right to
eat more than the others.

I work so hard not to play favorites.

Number 5! Quit crying already!

What are they?

How many of those things do you have?

Hey, don't call them "things."

They get pissed off when
they're treated like pets.

There are six of them,

and there isn't a Number 4
because four is bad luck.

There's one for each bullet.

For each bullet?

This guy here keeps rushing us.

Could you guys take your nap
after your work is done?

Hell no!

Hey, Number 3!

I keep telling you not to hit the others!

Mista!

I'll convince these guys to work.

So, Giorno...

You get the radio out of that plastic bag.

There'll be a feast after we do this job!

Let's do this, you guys!

Listen up. I'm going to sneak up
to the security watchhouse

and hide in its shadows
so that no one sees me.

Is there anyone waiting for
a yacht named Lagoon?

We've received a transmission from
a Mr. Zucchero on the Lagoon!

Please come to the boat watchhouse!

Is there anyone waiting for
a yacht named Lagoon?

We've received a transmission from
a Mr. Zucchero on the Lagoon!

He might decide to be cautious
and not answer the radio call...

Please come to the boat watchhouse!

Or he might get excited and run
out, thinking the hiding place

of the ten billion lire has been found.

This is a gamble,

Is there anyone waiting for the Lagoon?

but the one who comes
to the boat watchhouse

to answer that radio call is our guy.

We've received a transmission
from a Mr. Zucchero!

Giorno, if anyone comes near the
watchhouse, give me a signal.

If you're waiting for the Lagoon,
please come to the boat watchhouse!

I'm gonna shoot the guy
who takes the radio call!

But Bucciarati told me to not kill
him, so I'll miss any vital points.

Or at least, I'll try.

No one's making a move yet...

No one's heading over there.

Is there no one?

No one's waiting for the Lagoon?

There's a transmission from Mr. Zucchero!

No, there's no one. Nothing.

He's supposed to be
somewhere on this island.

Is he just being too cautious
to answer the radio call?

Did something happen, Zucchero?

Why did you request an announcement?

Is there a problem? Over.

What's going on?

No one's heading toward the watchhouse.

He's there! How?!

This isn't good. Does that
watchhouse have a back entrance?

He's already inside the watchhouse!

It's too dark to see his face.

Mista hasn't realized he's in there!

At this rate, the guy's going to
realize this is a trap and run!

I have to let Mista know!

What? The guy's coming to
answer the radio call?

Which one is it?

Who's heading toward the watchhouse?

N-No!

He's not heading there!

He's already inside!

Don't come out!

He's by the window!

That guy is...

one of Bucciarati's guys!

Didn't Zucchero take care
of him on the yacht?

Mista! Behind you!

He's on the radio! Mista!

Damn it! He can't hear me.

It's better than him not noticing!

He's already there!

Mista! He's already on the radio!

Come on! Pass, pass, pass!

Go, Six Bullets!

Menacing

Here we go!

Shoot!

Bazoo

Yay!

Heck yeah!

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

D-Did he get him?

Wh-Who the hell are you?!

Wh-What was that noise?

Gunshots.

Did it bother you?

It probably wasn't as loud as in the movies.

But if it did bother you...

I'm sorta busy right now,

so I'll listen to your complaints later.

Guess Giorno just can't wait.

So there was a rear entrance...

Meaning he came through this
door and got on the radio.

Either he was being cautious

or he's just used to always
going through the back door.

Still...

Good job, Bullets!

Yay!

Leg!

Leg! Hey, hey!

We got his right leg!

We shot him right through his right leg!

Yeah, you sure did.

Now he won't get away!

There are a bunch of people outside...

And this side is basically a cliff.

There's no way he could climb up.

He must be scurrying about right now.

If he were to hide somewhere...

He must be in that truck.

If he's a Stand user, his Stand is probably
close-range and extremely powerful.

If he was a remote-control type,
he would've attacked me by now.

In that case, the guy who
just got shot in the leg

is probably hiding behind the truck,

trying to lure me as close to him
as possible so that he can attack.

Well, it's not like he's going to
get me, even if I get close to him.

He's probably just beyond there.

But so long as we don't
know what his Stand is,

going over there alone
isn't a safe plan at all.

I should wait for Giorno and—

Well, I guess that option's out.

The guy's in the driver's seat.

He must've jump-started the engine.

It'll be bad news if this
truck gets away right now.

Damn it! This isn't good!

I haven't seen his face yet!

Giorno probably hasn't, either!

I don't know what his Stand is
yet, but I don't have a choice!

This is for the ten billion and Bucciarati!

Eat lead!

Mista!

Episodio 08
Six Bullets Appears, Part 2All we need is someone to head to the
island first and get rid of the guy.

It's perfect for situations like this.

I'll be going, too.

Mista! He's already on the radio!

Shoot!

Bazoo

Damn it! This isn't good!

It'll be bad news if this
truck gets away right now.

Episode 08 Six Bullets Appears, Part 2

Guido Mista's way of life ever since

he was little was to live
it as simply as possible.

He loved to sleep and found
joy in looking at branches

in the morning sun,
watching the clouds go by,

the scent of wine,
and having a bite of cheese.

Whenever he spotted cute girls,

he would talk to them,
even if they shot him down.

If he ran out of money,

he would jump any jerk
badmouthing movie stars

in front of the cinema and take their money.

At times, he'd get his ass whooped so
badly that the police had to intervene,

but Mista lived a very
happy life nonetheless.

Being simpleminded could
be taken as an insult,

but Mista always felt that

overthinking things invited fear
into one's heart, which was bad.

When Mista turned 17,
he learned from a certain incident

that people have pre-determined destinies.

When they're young,
people may find themselves

at a standstill or taking the
long way around at times,

but they ultimately end up traveling
the path they were destined to walk.

On a clear summer night, Mista was
wandering around like he usually did.

Mista!

Hey, wanna go have some fun?

Sorry, we have plans.

Ciao!

Sure.

No! Let go of me!

Shut your mouth!
There's no point in resisting!

Shut up! Quit your screaming!

The woman being punched in
the parked car was half-naked.

She was bleeding from her nose and
mouth, and about to lose consciousness.

For a moment, Mista hesitated
to get involved, but...

Y-You bastard!
Because he's so simpleminded,
his body acted on its own.

You bastard! What do you think
you're doing to our bro?!

You little shit!

No matter how close you may be,
there is no guarantee

you'll hit your target just
because you pulled the trigger.

When you're panicked or in a hurry,

you end up pulling the trigger even
if your gun isn't facing your target.

Both of the shots the hooligan fired

went under Mista's arm and
disappeared into the darkness.

The hell?!

S-Stay back! You hear me?!

Three, four, five, six shots!

Unbelievably, they all
faded into the darkness.

Then his panicked friends started shooting.

At this point, this is
nothing short of a miracle,

but not a single shot hit Mista.

Meanwhile, Mista was astonished at his
own state of quiet concentration.

What the hell's going on?

Wh-Who is this guy?!

Bro!

Wh-What are you—

After stealing one of the
guns and some bullets,

Mista calmly loaded the cylinder,

and pulled the trigger as calmly
as a nurse inserting a shot

into a patient's arm.

He pointed the gun at their faces
and shot four perfect shots.

Of course, this was his
first time killing someone,

but he didn't hesitate or feel any remorse.

In a helpless situation, Mista made the
decision to cut through the shadows.

Eat lead!

The driver of the truck must be its owner,

because...

his right leg isn't injured.

I wasn't planning to kill you, but...

O-Ow!

Damn it! You shot me twice,
you piece of shit!

Quit moving! I'm going to aim
properly this time, damn it!

How could I say something so lame?!

That's not what I meant!

I was supposed to ask how
that bastard didn't die

after I shot him in the head!

Did the bullet just happen
to miss his brain?

That was so charming of you, Mista.

Your name is Mista, isn't it?

I heard that you have even
more friends on Capri,

but you're the only one who's seen my face.

Isn't that right, Mista?

After that little trap you
set for me with the radio,

I wound up getting shot twice
in that surprise attack,

but if I face you head-on
with my Stand, Arts & Crafts,

I can easily deflect a bullet
from a puny little pistol.

By the way, I was a bit too busy to count,

but how many bullets was that in all, huh?

You fired four on this truck...

And I'm pretty sure you fired two back
at the watchhouse in Marina Grande.

Right? I counted correctly, didn't I, Mista?

Now I can get close enough to beat
the shit out of you safely, right?

Shit. I need to reload!

Wh-What the?!

Y-You're kidding me!
My left hand won't let go!

Whoa!

Hey! How long are you gonna keep driving?!
Stop the damn truck, you dumbass!

Yeah... Someone stop it, please.

Someone stop this truck! This thing is...

Think about it for a sec.

Why was I nice enough to let you
know that you were out of bullets?

Did you think it was because I'm a nice guy?

Mista...

I only told you because I knew you
could no longer escape from this truck.

The driver also can't let
up on the gas pedal,

nor can he let go of the steering wheel.

I told you because you
won't be able to reload

with your left hand stuck to the truck.

Those are the bullets that the
bastard's Stand deflected.

They've stopped in mid-air,
like they're fixed in place

and moving in conjunction with the truck.

Fixed in place...

He must've used his ability to affix
the bullets into place mid-air,

and to affix the driver
and me onto this truck.

His ability is to fix something
he's touched into place.

The bullet I shot at him was also affixed to his skin at the opening of the wound

and hasn't actually penetrated his head.
That's why he hasn't died!

To tell you the truth, Mista,

I'm ecstatic that you attacked me.

So much that I'm willing to forget the
fact that you shot a bullet at my head.

I mean, it was up in the air if Polpo's
fortune actually existed or not.

It's just a rumor among
some thugs, after all.

But the fact that you attacked me
means it actually exists!

I'm overflowing with hope
and motivation! All right!

I can passionately steal the ten billion
from that bastard Bucciarati!

I told you it would be easy for
my Stand to deflect your bullets!

Yee-haw!

Wh-What?! Another bullet
showed up from the shadows?

He fired two bullets in a single shot?

Is that Mista's Stand?

But...

I can still deflect it somewhat!

Hell yeah!

Well done, Six Bullets
Number 6 and Number 7!

And now that we've thrown you from the truck,

there's nothing more to worry about!

Ow! You shot me again, you bastard!

But... you're not getting away.

This is for ten billion!
You're not getting away!

There is a way to defeat him.

But he's strong... That's a fact.

Will I be able to do it?

Sale

Arts & Crafts

Blood...

A vehicle...

The enemy and Mista are in a car,
heading toward the top of the island.

Will I be able to catch up with them?

Either way, I need to find
a car to chase them in.

Four bullets?

What the hell's going on?

I only have four bullets!

Why do I only have four left? Seriously!

Mista, it's because you dropped some bullets!

You dropped them, dummy!

Four is unlucky.

Don't put all four in there.
It'll just be bad luck.

I-I can take my hands off the wheel!

Yes! My feet can move, too!

Now I can finally stop!

Don't you dare stop!

Huh? B-But you told me
to stop the truck earlier!

And what I'm saying right now is more
correct, at least when I'm talking to you.

Listen up. I want to go
back to Marina Grande.

My buddy's back at the marina.

There has to be another way back there.

I won't harm you. I'll even
thank you if you take me back.

Got it?!

That bastard stops the bullets at the surface
of his skin so they don't penetrate his body.

The ability to fix things in place...

How am I supposed to beat him?

If I can just shoot into his mouth...

The inside of his body should be defenseless.

He might actually die.

But I only have four bullets left.

Damn it, talk about unlucky!

Three would've been much better.

Now that I've seen his face and know who
he is, I don't need to do anything dangerous.

It'd be much safer to meet back
up with Giorno at the marina.

I have extra bullets with
the rest of my things, too.

Th-That bastard!

Impossible! He scaled the cliff already?!

Hey, stop the truck!

Huh? Now what?

Stop the truck, I said!

Hurry it up!

Th-That's the guy from earlier!

Mista...

There's no way in hell I'm going to
let you tell your buddies who I am!

I'm not letting you get away, Mista!

He can affix rocks in the
air, just like the bullets?

He climbed up here
like he was using a ladder?

Why the hell did you stop
the truck, you dumbass?!

Huh?

Drive!

Huh? Wait, what?

Full speed ahead!
You'll be sorry if you stop!

If you want to settle things
right here, right now...

Let's do this!

Driver, don't you dare stop the truck!

Just gotta tap it slightly with my finger...

Even if it's just slightly,
if I tap it over and over,

it'll just keep building up force
in the place where it's affixed.

I can't hit it too hard.

It'll throw off my aim, and my enemy will
figure out which way it's going to fly.

And then... I let it loose!

Bam

What?!

It came back to you, Mista.

Those three Stands of yours that you
just fired lost control and flew off.

Just a little at a time...

You just keep tapping it with
just a little bit of force.

Just like tapping an SOS in Morse code.

The aim's not perfect, so I can't use it
on things that move around too much,

but I can definitely use it on you right now!

Th-This really sucks...

Talk about bad luck.

Four is always the absolute worst for me.

Ever since I was a kid...

There are just some
misfortunes you can't see.

Still, other than that, it's a good number.

I only have one bullet left,
but this means the worst is over, right?

Now the number's one, damn it!

Number 5! Number 6! Group up!

We're all gonna group up on this last shot!

This is the the last of them,
so give it your all!

Yeah!

Stay put, Mista!

Don't you try to shoot me again, you dumbass!

Just look at this distance! No matter what
abilities your Stand uses on the bullets,

or how many you fire,
I clearly have the upper hand.

I have plenty of time to defend myself!

You've realized by now that it's impossible
to beat me, haven't you, Mista?

If I told you...

that I only have one bullet left in this chamber, would you believe me?

I'm telling you the truth.

I only have one bullet left.

If I shoot it and you somehow
manage to deflect it,

I'll be out of bullets.

You'll find out anyway, so I
might as well tell you now.

If I miss this last shot,
you'll see that I'm out of bullets!

Though messing up is hypothetical right now...

I'm definitely going to shoot you
with this one, final bullet!

What are you pointlessly
rambling on about, Mista?

It doesn't matter to me how
many bullets you have left.

Whether you fire a single bullet or
a hundred, you can't defeat me!

It's not pointless at all.

You're definitely going
to let your guard down

now that you know I only
have one bullet left.

This is pointless.

He's gonna use his Stand!

Leave it to me!

Let's go! We only have one target!

Give it your all!

You're aiming for the inside of my mouth.

Am I wrong?

He opened his mouth on his own!

He's not going to defend himself!

We'll just have to charge right in!

I knew it.

Ow!

I knew you were aiming there...

At the inside of my mouth!

That's what any normal person would think...

That I shouldn't be able to use my
ability to affix things inside my body.

It's a pain in the ass to guard myself,
so I opened my mouth for you!

Impossible...

He can even affix things inside his
mouth to guard against the bullet?

Damn... This really freakin' hurts!

But... it looks like you weren't lying
about that being your last bullet.

I see you're not shooting again.

You done now, Mista?

If you're finished...

The launching power on this baby...

is more than ready, Mista!

Take this! Release!

He really did let down his guard.

He let his guard down because
Mista was out of bullets!

We just wanted to get closer to him,

because the closer we get,
the better we can aim!

Wh-What?!

Wh-When did they—

Shit! They're too close!

Here we go, boys!

Aim!

Arts & Crafts! Defend!

The bullet split in two?!

It won't matter if he gets
one more clean hit on me,

but... he's not aiming for that, is he?

That's not good.

Don't tell me... he's aiming for that!

That's—

I aimed for the same wound.

If I shoot another round at the
one that's stopped in your head,

it's going to push it just enough
to dig further into your skull!

I mean, if you're invincible enough to
withstand that too, I'm sorta screwed, but...

We did it!

Yes!

Yes!

Come on, Number 3.

I keep telling you to not
bully Number 5, jeez...

He's still somewhat alive,
even though he's got a bullet in his brain.

Guess your Stand really is invincible.

Bucciarati told me not to kill you, but...

Hey, we're going back!
Back to the marina!

What do you want?!

What the hell is with you guys?!

Damn it.

Who the hell do they think I am?

Telling me to stop, then go...

I'm not a freakin' taxi, you dumbasses!

How dare you threaten me?!

I'll let you off the hook for now,
but next time I'm gonna let you have it!

I'm terribly sorry, but I'm chasing someone.

Could you take me to the top
of the island in this truck?

Quit wasting time! I'm desperate here!

You're gonna drive! Got it?!

Y-Yes, sir...

Episodio 09
The First Mission from the BossOw...

Yeah, you're going to have
to go to the hospital.

I know that! I'm asking you to
do something in the meantime!

Very well.

H-Hey, Fugo, you aren't—

Hey!

What the hell is this?!

Staples!

But wow, it actually closed up,
just like closing a comic book!

Narancia, could you wrap up his
stomach with masking tape now?

Sure thing.

You sure this isn't going to get infected?

Don't worry about a thing.

Actually, you know, I kinda like it.

Would you pipe down?

Well done, you guys.

Thanks to you, we were able
to get to Capri safely.

Zucchero, who attacked us on the boat,
and the guy Mista handled

are both passed out on the boat.
No need to worry about them anymore.

Then let's hurry up and go to the place
where the ten billion lire is hidden!

Where did you hide it, Bucciarati?

A hidden safe at the bank?

Or maybe you buried it
in a cave on the island?

Could you wait just a bit longer?

Why's that?

Why are you so worried about the time?

Shh!

Hey, you guys. We're still
in here, so how 'bout it?

Can't you do the cleaning later?

Does your name happen to be Toilette?

Huh? What was that?

If your name is actually Toilette,
that would mean this is your house.

You can boss around anyone
you want in your own house.

But if that isn't the case,
you've got no right to boss me around.

Huh? Hey, wait, dumbass!

Didn't you hear me?
I said not to go in there!

Crack

Wh-What the hell do you think you're doing?!

You want a piece of me?!

What's going on?

A new enemy?

I'll kill you!

Wait!

Everyone, stop Narancia!

Why did you stop me?!

Could you be...

That voice...

It appears we've kept you waiting.

All of you, bow.

This is Mr. Pericolo,
one of the capos of Passione.

I came to accept the ten billion lire,

Bucciarati.

Episodio 09 The First Mission from the Boss

I contacted him as soon
as we reached the island.

Mr. Pericolo came all this
way to accept the money.

One of Passione's capos...

Thank you so much for
coming all this way, sir.

No, no. I'm the one who said I wanted to come.

All of you, lift your heads.

You must be the newbie I heard about.

Yes, sir.

Bucciarati's told me all about you.

Now that you've joined Passione,
you're basically family.

You're free to call me Mr. Pericolo.

Thank you, sir.

You, there. Sorry about earlier.

This one doesn't like being touched.

Sure.

You...

You mean, "Yes, sir!"

Mr. Pericolo,

why are you dressed up as a janitor?

There's a perfectly good reason
for this. I'll tell you later.

More importantly, you do have it, don't you?

The ten billion lire to hand
over to the organization.

Yes, sir. Right here.

What? What did you just say?!

He said it's right here!

Here?!

Bucciarati, where is it?

All I see are urinals...

Plop

I-It was inside the urinal?!

I mean, that's as safe as it gets, but...

Sucks to be the guys who've been
peeing there this whole time!

Yup... It's real.

This necklace alone is worth at least
seven or eight hundred million.

Bucciarati,

I won't bother asking how
you got this fortune.

All the organization cares about
is that you have the money.

Wait, you're already putting it away?

C-Could I just touch it a little?

Maybe even smell it?

The reality this fortune shows us is that
the owner is intelligent and trustworthy.

Congratulations, Bucciarati.

You've been promoted to the position of capo.

H-Hell, yeah! He's a capo!

Bucciarati's finally a capo!

You'll be taking over Polpo's
turf, now that he's dead.

You'll be overseeing the
gambling, money-lending,

and smuggling at the harbor, as well
as the restaurants and hotels in Naples.

Fifty percent of the profit will go to the
organization, and the other fifty will be yours.

That's amazing!

He earned authority just like that!

With Bucciarati's brains and popularity,
he'll be rolling in the cash in no time!

But the ball suddenly started rolling
as soon as this newbie Giorno joined.

Is he some kind of lucky boy or something?

By the way,

I know you just took over for Polpo,

but he had left one job unfinished.

Of course, you'll be taking on any
jobs that Polpo had, Bucciarati.

Are you okay with that?

A job that Polpo left unfinished?

It's a direct order from the boss.

The... boss?

The boss...

The boss no one's ever met?

An order... directly from him?

Correct. I'll tell you right here and now.

You'll be guarding the boss's daughter,
and risking your lives doing so.

That's all.

Daughter?

The boss...

Did you say "daughter"?
The boss has a daughter?

The boss we were eventually going to
track down and defeat has a daughter?

You'll start guarding her right now.
I've handed her over to you.

Handed her over?

Bucciarati!

Could that guy be...

No, not "guy."

She must be the boss's daughter!

That's her?

Do you mind if I go to the bathroom?

That's fine, Trish.

For now, stay by her side.

The order is already in effect.

Bucciarati.

Her name is Trish Una,
and she's fifteen years old.

"Una" is her mother's maiden name,
not the boss's family name.

Trish hasn't met the boss once in her life.

Bucciarati, as you're well aware,
no one knows who the boss is.

But of course, even the boss has a past,
especially when he was young.

Two months ago, a woman named
Donatella died of illness in Calabria.

A few days before her death, she asked
that a man named Solido Naso be found.

That man was Trish's father.

I'm sure she was just trying to look
out for her daughter's well-being,

but...

Naso doesn't exist.

Because that was one of the aliases
that the boss used when he was young.

Correct?

Beware of anyone trying to
look into the name Naso.

Anyone with any status in Passione
is very cautious about that.

Just trying to look into
the boss's past would mean

challenging the organization itself.

Word about Donatella eventually spread.

Word spread even more when it
came out that she had a daughter.

Of course, the boss
caught wind of this, as well.

The boss's decision was immediate.

Through a few other men,
he gave me the order

and placed her in my custody
soon after her mother's death.

The boss must've known immediately.

He didn't know she existed until now,

but he knew for a fact that
Trish was indeed his daughter.

And right after I took Trish into my custody,

we found out that someone was after her life.

If the boss's order had come
even thirty minutes later,

Trish most likely would've been
kidnapped by them, and then...

murdered.

Who is it? Who's after her?

People who have betrayed the organization.

We don't know how many of them there are.

They're trying to defeat the boss and
take over his drug trafficking routes.

Drugs...

They're under the impression that
Trish knows a secret about the boss.

They want information so that
they can defeat the boss.

But Trish is just a frail
little girl who knows nothing.

How long will we be guarding her?

One week... Actually,
it could even be less.

It's just until the boss finds those
traitors and gets rid of them.

Leave this island immediately
and hide her somewhere.

The only ones who know that Trish
is with you are the boss and myself.

Mr. Pericolo.

You said that order was supposed
to go to Polpo, correct?

Which means...

The enemies are Stand users...

I'd say that's a safe assumption.

They're most likely moving as a team, as well.

We don't yet know how many there are.

I don't have a Stand ability.

This is all I can do for you.

I'll contact you again if
I learn anything else.

Um...

M-Me?

Yes. Is it with you... um...

Am I going to be with you now?

Yes, that's correct.

But it'll be all six of us.

We will be risking our lives to protect you.

I see.

Then would you mind taking off that jacket?

My jacket? Why?

Just hurry up and take it off.

It's not as if I want to see
you shirtless or anything.

V-Very well.

I don't have a handkerchief,
so go buy one for me.

Also, some stockings and
Givenchy Blush No. 2.

The stockings need to be
reinforced at the thighs.

Get the latest issue of Italian Vogue, too,

and some mineral water.

I'd rather die than drink one
that's not from France, though.

When you're done gawking at the
scenery, go buy that stuff for me.

Guard the boss's daughter, huh?

So we suddenly have a connection to the
mysterious boss that I've been looking for.

This is definitely worth doing.

If we can see this through,

Bucciarati will be able to gain the
same level of trust that Polpo had.

But if we fail, it'll mean our lives.

All six of us are well aware of that fact.

What's your problem? Calm down.

I'm just trying to pet you.

At 9:25 this morning at Naples Prison, Polpo shot himself in the head.

Hey, come on.

Quit struggling! I can't read it. Jeez...

"At 9:25 this morning at Naples Prison,
Polpo shot himself in the head."

Well, damn... I was sure it'd be Polpo.

Who is it, then?

Who's the one guarding
Trish, who disappeared?

Find them

Find them

Well, then...

"Find them," eh?

But was anyone as reliable as Polpo?

Only a capo would be tasked
with such an important job.

And someone with Stand abilities.

Did anyone else like that exist?

And that's it for shopping.

Surroundings are all clear.

Let's see...

If I go this way and turn here,
I'll end up back on this street,

and then head in the opposite direction.

Okay!

Narancia, listen carefully.

That's a list of food and other
things you need to buy.

These are the keys to the car.

You can do this, Narancia.

I know you can pull it off.

Okay.

Listen carefully. No one knows
anyone is at this hideout,

not even the people at the winery
in the vineyard out front.

Once you're done shopping, try going in
circles on the same path over and over again.

Also try U-turning every once in a while.

Check to see if anyone's following you.

Then, come home after
switching over to the other car

that I arranged just in case
in one of the city's parking lots.

No one else knows that we're
guarding the boss's daughter,

but if someone's looking for us, the last
thing we want them to do is follow us.

Do you understand?

Someone needs to go shopping.

It's very important.

But we have to make absolutely sure
no one finds out about this hideo—

Jeez, I get it already!

Leave it to me!

Okay, now repeat all the steps I just
explained to you from the beginning.

Huh?

Once I'm done shopping,

I drive around in circles
in the vineyard out there—

Jab

Ow!

Wrong! Quit messing around!
Again, from the beginning!

Huh?

Um...

Drive around so I don't get dizzy—

Jab

Urgh! What the hell is your problem?!

Come on, Abbacchio!

Tell him to stop jabbing
me with the damn keys!

I'm older than him, damn it!

Letting him go shopping is a mistake!

You two will have to figure out whether
or not you should be jabbed on your own.

But with Narancia's Stand ability, he should
be able to stop anyone tailing him.

That's why Bucciarati
ordered him to go shopping.

So basically, that means I just need to make
sure I'm not followed back here, right?

By anyone who might follow me!

Something's wrong.

It doesn't look like anyone's following me,

but something feels off.

I've got a bad feeling about switching over
to the other car that Fugo prepared, too.

Huh?

Come on already.

Where exactly are you headed, huh, Narancia?

That came from below!

Hey, so, where are you headed?

You keep looking behind you.

Are you being followed or something?

Who the hell are you?! Get outta the car!

Whoa, whoa, whoa, talk about scary!

I'm the one asking the questions here.

Don't answer a question with
another question. That's rude.

Shut up! Get the hell out
of my car, you dumbass!

You're not leaving me with any choice.

My name's Formaggio.

I'm a member of the organization.

You already know that Polpo
died yesterday, right?

Yet everyone on your team just
happened to disappear at once.

Shit... He's bad news.

He shouldn't know the truth,
but he's definitely after us.

Right when I had something important
to discuss with you guys...

I-Is he a Stand user?

Narancia, I finally managed to
find you, but why are they gone?

Where's Bucciarati and the rest of your squad?

Who knows?

I have no idea where they are right now.

Did you check the
restaurants around here?

This car...

It's a rental, isn't it?

Bucciarati was the one who rented it.

If you didn't know that,
why the hell are you in this car?

Well?

I-I always drive around
in Bucciarati's cars.

I'm seventeen, so I don't
have my own car yet.

That's why I'm borrowing his.

Oh, yeah. Did you hear?

Apparently the mortician is trying to figure
out how the hell to cremate Polpo's corpse.

They can't figure out how to get
his body into the furnace.

They're just gonna have to chop him
up into tiny pieces, aren't they?!

Shut up!

Hey, you think so, too, right?

Huh?

What the hell? Th-There's no one here!

You actually fell for it.

Man, you're useless.

Say, Narancia, why are you guys

hiding somewhere when
a capo's funeral is going on?

I'm gonna make you talk
if I can't just follow you!
Now you've done it, you asshole!

You're gonna tell me all kinds
of things, right here and now!

You bastard...

Huh?

You bastard...

I'll murder you!

What the hell is that?!

Li'l Bomber!

So he's a Stand user... Tiny Feet!

Bada Bada Bada

Shit!

Look at how badly I'm bleeding!

How dare you?! How dare you?! How dare you?!

Bada Bada Bada

I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

This is definitely not good...

I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

Th-This little shit!

I'll kill you!

Sh-Shit! He's out of his goddamn mind...

He's lost it and is shooting anything in sight!

And I'm stuck in this narrow
car with nowhere to run!

That's the most dangerous part of all this!

A-A bomb?!

Murder him, Li'l Bomber!

How do you like that?
And that?! And that?! And that?!

Are you dead yet?

Ow! Damn it!

Did we do it?

H-He's gone!

Did the blast blow him away?

But... there's not even a
shred of his corpse left!

Wh-Where did he go?!

Oh, come on... I'm right here.

I can make myself small.

That's my ability!

Tiny Feet... All the other guys
say this ability is worthless.

What determines if something is worthless
or not is how you use your brain.

That's how it is with abilities.

What the hell? I don't see him anywhere!

How the hell?! Damn it, where did he go?

Is he here?

The same thing happened when
he first showed up in the car!

Well, good luck in your search.
Where the hell did he just pop up from?

I'm gonna be buying some time here.

Now he's hiding somewhere!

A woman...

This bastard's bought stuff for a woman.

Stockings and blush...
And it's high-end blush to boot!

Who's he shopping for?

Is it for his mom or his older sister?

No... Chicks are super picky
about what they like,

so they buy fashion and
makeup stuff on their own.

The only chick who'd have
a guy buy stuff like this...

is a chick who can't leave
her place for some reason!

This is becoming more and more suspicious.

Looks like my gut feeling was right!

As I thought, without a doubt,

the one who was ordered to guard
the boss's daughter is Bucciarati!

In that case, I'll make sure I get Narancia
to show me where they're hiding.

My ability should start working
on him at any moment now...

Damn it... That bastard's definitely
somewhere around here...

I'm sure he plans to follow
me all the way back.

But...

I'm gonna find him and kill him!

I just have to make it back
without getting followed.

I'm going to follow the orders I was given!

Episodio 10
Hitman TeamYou're not leaving me with any choice.

My name's Formaggio.

How do you like that?
And that?! And that?! And that?!

I'm sure he plans to follow
me all the way back.

But...

I just have to make it back
without getting followed.

I'm going to follow the orders I was given!

Did you hear that loud noise?

I wonder what that was.

Come back for now, Li'l Bomber!

That bastard is somewhere nearby,
but I should get away from here.

With all these people gathering, it'd be
a bad idea to attack with my Stand.

Huh? The bleeding's stopped already.

I thought he cut me really good, too.

Huh?

Where'd this knife come from?

This isn't mine.

My knife's not this big.

Where'd mine go?

These shoes aren't mine, either!
They're way too big!

Where the hell did my shoes go?

There's something

weird about this seat...

A-And this steering wheel.

I-I can't reach!

My foot won't reach the pedals,
and this seat is huge!

I can't see through the windshield!

What the hell?! This car isn't mine, either!

Where'd it go? Where'd the
car I came here in go?!

I can't get back without it! Damn it!

Is he actually that stupid?

Get a damn clue! You're shrinking!

The effects of the wound I gave
you are finally starting to show!

W-Wait, these are my shoes and knife.

Which means...

Did you finally figure it out, you moron?

But it's too late now.

You won't be able to drive like that!

S-So this is that stalker guy's Stand ability?

You're gonna tell me where
the boss's daughter is.

The battle's already begun.

No one can turn back now!

Episodio 10  Hitman Team

Hey, did you guys get my mineral water yet?

I'm thirsty.

I'm about to die from thirst.

I'd actually like to have lunch soon myself.

I mean, I'm fine, but I need
to feed these little guys.

Feed us!

Narancia is indeed taking a while.

This is why I was worried about him going.

Drop it, Fugo. How many times
must you bring this up?

I'm not going to drop it! After I—

I-I apologize.

Anything cut by my Tiny Feet becomes small.

It does take a little while for the
ability to go into effect, though.

The clothes and bandana you have
on now are shrinking with you.

Your shoe and knife, which were separated
from your body, have stopped shrinking,

which means that the more you shrink,
the fewer things you'll be able to use.

O-Oh, yeah! I need to get a hold
of Bucciarati and the others!

Ow! What the hell's with
that automated door?!

I'm still shrinking?

This door...

I've become so light that it won't open!

Exactly, you moron.

Still...

I have to get to that phone as soon
as possible so they can help me!

It opened, damn it!

It's useless!

It looks like you haven't realized this, but
your clothes and wallet are shrinking with you.

You need a telephone card or
coins to use the pay phone!

It only takes coins that are the right size!

Narancia's Height: 62.5cm

This guy might be smarter than I thought...

This isn't good.

Having his friends find out my
ability is the last thing I need.

And if Bucciarati finds out about this,

he'll move the boss's daughter somewhere else!

That definitely can't happen!

I'm not gonna let that happen!

H-He's here! That bastard's
gotta be around here somewhere!

Where are you?
Are you hiding under the phone?

Come out here, damn it!

This is perfect.

Are you over here?

In a few more minutes, he'll shrink
down to the size of a cockroach.

Where are you?!

Narancia's Height: 58.0cm
His Stand's size and power will
get so small, it'll be powerless,

and then I'll be able to
torture the shit out of him.

Then I'll win!

I guess I don't have a choice.

He shouldn't be able to find me,
but I just have to wait a little longer...

I finally figured it out, you bastard!

You're in my right ass pocket!

Now I've got you!
The ability to become smaller?

Were you in my pocket this whole time?

Damn it. But you sure are tiny...

Wait... How did he figure
out I was in his pocket?!

Shoot him dead, Li'l Bomber!

T-Turn back!

Wha—

A b-ballpoint pen?!

Narancia's Height: 53.0cm

Damn it! Where'd you go?!

What the hell did you do?!

That stalker bastard! Where are you?!

That was a close one.

When my Tiny Feet shrinks
something other than myself,

it takes a while because
of the energy it needs,

but when I turn things back to normal size,

I can do it instantly, like I
did with that ballpoint pen.

The repulsion it created in that moment

was enough to send me flying over here.

But how'd he figure out
that I was in his pocket?

Did I move around too
much and tickle his ass?

I-Impossible!

I hid immediately! How'd it find me?!

There you are! You're not getting
away, you stalker bastard!

It's coming after me!

Th-This is bad! Tiny Feet!

Wh-Where'd that bastard go?!

That was way too close.

If the air pressure from the tire hadn't
sent me flying, I would've been done for!

But I'm sure it won't find me down—

Y-You can't be serious! Shit!

This Stand's ability isn't
just shooting endlessly!

It's somehow finding me,
and it's definitely following me!

And it's not like it's seeing or
hearing my movements.

That wouldn't explain how it
figured out I was in his pocket

or how it knew where the tire's
air pressure sent me flying.

I found you! You're down in that drain!

I-It can even find me underwater?!

Tiny Feet!

D-Damn it! Think, think,
think, think, think!

I can't die here!

The Hitman Team has nine members.

Formaggio is one of them.

2 years ago / Naples

I'm planning to address the trash
problem at next week's assembly.

Are you sure it'll be okay?

Don't worry. I'm just going to tell the
Minister of Tourism the right answer.

It's the same thing as usual.

I always worry that you might
be pushing yourself too hard.

Dear, don't you think you're
drinking too much today?

What the hell, Pesci?

Are you drinking milk again?

B-But my stomach sorta turns
when I drink espresso.

That's why you're such a mammoni, Pesci!

Just by drinking that milk, it's possible
you're making us lamer by association.

Why do you think we even
bring you along, anyway?

You need to correct things like that first.

O-Okay...

So, Formaggio, how are things going?

That's all yours, Pesci.
A little gift from me to you.

Looks like things went well.

Yeah, the job's basically done.

Now we just have to watch it happen.

Let's get this over with
and watch a soccer match.

Narancia Ghirga

Li'l Bomber

It was delicious.

Thank you very much.

We'll be waiting for your return.

All right, let's finish things off.

That was wonderful.

I'm glad I went with the white tod—

What's the matter, dear? Are you in pain?

Hey! What the hell are you
doing parking here?!

Get outta the way!

W-Wait, what's that coming out
from underneath the car?

Th-Th-That's blood!

All right, let's go home.

What's the matter, Pesci?
Did your knees give out?

We're back!

How'd it go?

Perfectly!

The guy's been blown to bits.

But you ended up killing the chick
he was with in the process, too.

I guess this job was perfect
for your useless Stand ability.

Whatever, man. If you got a problem,
take care of this yourself.

As much as I'd love to,
the leader wants me to conserve

Melone, how much was this job?

my ability until we absolutely need to use it.

Twenty million lire.

Damn, that's cheap!

Ghiaccio, calm down.
We'll talk about money later.

More importantly...

Where are Sorbet and Gelato?

Are they playing hooky?

Maybe they're getting it on somewhere.

They're a couple, aren't they?

And you call my Stand ability useless?

No, something's definitely wrong.

Gelato's one thing, but Sorbet would
never miss out on a chance to get rich.

He's always made sure to
show up to claim his share.

Once an organization is established
and starts to mature as a group,

there will always be people within
that group who want to rebel.

When smuggling cheap drugs
coming from Central Asia

to various countries in
Europe as well as America,

they make a profit that's
tens to hundreds of times more.

Which means it's not the least bit strange

that there will be those
who show up and try

to take over the boss's territory,
even at the risk of their own lives.

Did you find them?

No, there's no sign of them.

They must've been dealt
with because they were

trying to find out who the boss was!

It's definitely possible.

They're two crazy bastards.

Polpo's in control of all the gambling,

and the jerks selling the drugs
are also making a fortune.

But the only thing that we, the Hitman
Team, get is our pay from the boss!

This ain't fair!

We're the best there is in the
whole damn organization!

We deserve way better!

He suffocated?

Yeah... Just Gelato, though.

Sorbet's corpse isn't here.

"Punishment"

Punishment...

A few days later, a bunch of packages with
no sender were delivered to the team.

Seriously? Again?

Who the hell's the sender?!

Frames?

They're not paintings, though.

Is this what they call
modern art or some shit?

There's something weird in them.

Hey!

Th-That's the same color nail
polish that Sorbet always wears!

I-I've seen it before...

He and Gelato use the same shade!

Get the frames out and line them up.

There were a total of
36 of these art pieces.

Oh, hell no...

You can't be serious... This is...

I don't want to see any more!

Shut up!

That's...

They were pieces of Sorbet's body,
chopped up and preserved in formalin.

When they put his face together,
they saw that it was distorted in fear.

He was likely cut into pieces by a
very sharp knife, starting with his toes.

It was a rather intense
way of getting killed.

That day, the Hitman Team
came to a new understanding.

D-Do you think that Sorbet

was sliced up right in front of Gelato?

Yeah. And he was so overcome
with fear and despair

that he choked on his
own gag and suffocated!

This was a silent message from the boss.

All of you...

Forget all about Sorbet and Gelato.

From then on, they ended up
getting the cold shoulder.

They never tried to find out
the boss's identity ever again.

At least, not until...

they found out that the
boss had a daughter.

Damn it! I'm not going to
die in a place like this!

We're gonna kill the boss and
take over his drug route!

We're gonna claw our way
up from this hellhole!

It's riddled with holes?

He shot that rat to death? Why?

C-Could it be...

It went the other way.

It's looking around for me.

Breathing?! So that's it!

Narancia's Stand, Li'l Bomber,
detects its target when they breathe!

Mosquitoes find animals to suck
blood from by searching for

the CO2 that they exhale.

This is the same thing!

So that's how he found
out I was in his pocket!

Come to think of it, when all those
randos showed up in the alleyway,

he stopped searching for me.

There was a chance he would've
shot one of those randos!

It had detected my breathing!

There you are!

He shot again!

Looks like he can't tell the
difference between me and the rats.

In that case...

Look at those creepy little shits...

Th-These numbers...
and this movement pattern...

The ones that are breathing must be rats!

Their speed is the same!

They're all going the same direction!

A threat... You were only a threat
when I didn't know how you worked.

How were you finding me?

Now that I know that, you're more
harmless than a mosquito,

Narancia!

I win, Narancia!

I'm gonna get the hell outta here and
wait for you to shrink into nothing!

H-How?

The same movement...

All of them are moving the same way,

but there's only one rat
who's breathing really hard...

Are you tired? You're out of breath.

Is there something heavy on top of you
that's making it hard to breathe?

I think it might be worth it to shoot
the shit out of that fatty there!

Shit!

Yes! A clean shot!

Th-That was close...

If I hadn't returned to my normal
size, I would've been done for!

If time hadn't passed to the
point of you becoming so small

Narancia's Height: 13.2cm

that your Stand power
was rendered useless...

I would've been a goner!

I-I didn't get him!

Did I become so small that Li'l
Bomber's power also shrank?

My attacks won't work anymore!

Episodio 11
Narancia's Li'l BomberI think it might be worth it to shoot
the shit out of that fatty there!

Yes!

Th-That was close...

If I hadn't returned to my normal
size, I would've been done for!

If time hadn't passed to the
point of you becoming so small

that your Stand power
was rendered useless...

I would've been a goner!

I-I didn't get him!

D-Damn it.

If I'm getting smaller and smaller,

does that mean Li'l Bomber's
power got smaller, too?

That bastard's on the move!

Come back, Li'l Bomber!

Th-This really pisses me off,

but I need to hide somewhere.

The dude's desperate.

If he finds me, he'll do everything
he can to get me to tell him

where the boss's daughter is.

I-It's so far!

The sidewalk's so damn wide!

Move! You're in my way, damn it!

Damn it...

Now I've got you.

Well, shit...

You've caused me so much trouble.

Once you've been hit with Tiny Feet's
ability, you can never get away.

Now, you're going to tell me

where Bucciarati and his guys
are hiding the boss's daughter.

K-Kill me!

Damn it, just kill me already!

Do you really think I want to live so badly

that I'd tell you where
my friends are? Huh?!

Narancia Ghirga was born
in 1984 and is a Leo.

When he was ten...

N-Narancia...

I'm right here, Mom.

Mom...

Hey, Dad...

Mom's eye disease...

You shithead...

That was the beginning of the path
that led Narancia to where he is now.

Episodio 11  Narancia's Li'l Bomber

Hey, I need to ask for directions.

How many minutes would it
take to walk to this place?

Narancia rebelled against his father.
Minutes? That'd take you hours.

He'd sleep over at his
delinquent friends' houses,

and get by daily by eating the
food he had stolen that day.

It all went as planned!

It's all because you told
us about that shop, Bro.

You sure you don't need to go to school?

You actually come from a decent home.

Like I give a shit about that home.

The most important thing in
this world is friendship!

Yeah.

You should dye your hair blonde like mine.

Then the chicks would be all over you.

Yeah!

What? Seriously?

What do you think?

You look so dumb!

Hey, where's Bro?

Who knows? I haven't seen him in a few days.

Huh...

But the next day...

You bastards!

Put both hands on the wall!

You little shit!
You're going to juvenile hall!

What the hell are you talking
about?! Me, a robber?!

Of course I'm no—

Quit lyin'! We have a witness!

Wha—

That's him! That blonde brat is the suspect!

N-No, I'm not!

I'm sure of it! He beat me
up and took my money!

Quit lyin', you old hag!
I didn't do anything!

Just admit to your crimes, you little shit!

Hey! That's going too far!

You saw him, Counselor.

He was about to hit her again!

A robber...

A blonde brat...

Don't tell me...

No, that's not possible!

Stop thinking up shit like that, damn it!

A year later, when Narancia left
juvenile hall, his eye was afflicted.

After the officer hit his eye,

the eye wound up infected
and never got better.

When he returned to town,
strange rumors were going around.

Look at that.

I heard his mom died from
an eye disease, too.

How do they know that?

I only ever told Bro that...

Wow, they already let you out?

I don't want to get infected.

Stay the hell away from me.

It couldn't be... But Bro is...

He felt trapped, so he used me as a scapegoat...

The one most afraid of these rumors
concerning the eye disease

was Narancia himself.

This is fate...

Soon... just like Mom...

I'm going to die from this eye disease!

That's what he believed.
He had nowhere to go.

He was all alone.

Narancia had given up on
life at the age of fifteen.

How awful. He's just a child.

It's a pity, but we shouldn't get involved.

The boy brought Narancia into a restaurant,

then told his friend at the
table and the shop's host...

I'd like to feed him some spaghetti!

You don't mind, do you?

His friend at the table
didn't ask any questions,

nor did he give him a look of disgust.

He just set the plate of spaghetti
he'd ordered for himself

in front of the filthy child.

He then had the kid receive
the treatment he needed.

Three weeks later...

Why are you doing all this for me?

There's no reason.

If you want, you can stay at my house.

But kids like you should go
back home to their parents.

Also, go to school. Got it?

U-Um, are you in a gang?

I don't want to go back home.

Please let me work for you!

Don't be so naïve, you little shit!

If you say that again, I'll punch you!

As instructed, Narancia went back home
and even started going back to school.

But he could never trust his father again.

Why did he get so serious about scolding me?

There's nothing special about me.

But...

That rage didn't come from hate or disgust,

and it didn't feel like it
was meant to insult me.

It was totally different from when
my dad or those cops got mad at me.

When I think about how he
acted, I feel confident.

Real men...

should work for guys like him!

Six months later, Narancia went to see

one of the capos of the organization,
Polpo, without Bucciarati knowing...

and he passed the test.

Narancia, if you're going to
tell me where that girl is,

now is probably the best time to do it.

The girl you're trying to kidnap doesn't
belong to a gang or anything like that!

She's just an ordinary girl!

Bucciarati hates shit like that,
even if it's an order!

No decent person would like that!

We said we were going to protect her,

so we're going to protect
her, no matter what!

Would you quit with your worthless drivel?

Well, shit...

All this crap about your friends
and protecting this chick...

That's not what we're talking about here.

I'm talking about the fact
that if we defeat the boss,

we'll have a drug route
worth hundreds of billions.

Y-You bastard!

Hundreds of billions!

That's an amount worth a
few people dying over!

It's going to be ours!
There's no turning back now!

Since she's the boss's daughter,
she's bound to have a Stand ability!

The boss doesn't want
people finding that out!

We'll definitely be able to figure out who
the boss is through his daughter's ability!

His daughter is a hint for defeating the boss,

whose identity we don't even know!

What? That girl's a Stand user?

Did you know...

In South America, there's a spider
called the southern black widow.

Apparently its venom can even kill humans.

This spider isn't deadly.

I actually caught it in the sewers
earlier. It's completely harmless.

But...

Even a normal spider's bite is venomous.

Y-You aren't gonna...
More than venomous enough to paralyze
tiny little insects and eat them!

Li'l Bomber!

Whoa, there!

I told you, your Stand is powerless now!

This bottle is gonna be the ring, Narancia!

Y-You bastard! Hey!

It's looking at you!
It's looking right at you!

It's watching you carefully
with all eight of its eyes!

Open up! Open the bottle!

Damn it!

Listen carefully. Even if it bites
you, you won't die instantly.

First, its venom will paralyze your body,
so you'll no longer be able to move.

But once you can't move and it
traps you, you're in real danger.

Then it'll start injecting you with even
more venom and digestive juices.

Those digestive juices will slowly melt your
insides to the consistency of a milkshake

so it can suck you right up.

And you're going to be
conscious the whole time.

If you finally feel like talking, you can
still talk while you're being eaten.

But you're probably better
off telling me right now

where the boss's daughter is.

I really don't want to see a person
end up melted and eaten by a spider.

I-It's fast!

You bastard!

A shard of glass?!

He somehow got it and kept it on him?!

W-Webbing?

When did...

It bit him!

You can't move anymore because
your muscles are spasming.

Just hurry up and tell me.

This is your last chance
if you don't wanna die.

Damn it... Like hell I'm gonna tell you!

Damn it!
Looks like it's injecting its
digestive juices into you now.

It's gonna melt you...

Huh?

What's that?

You dropped this when you took that shard

of glass out of your pocket,
so I picked it up...

Maybe... I don't need
you to tell me anymore.

This is a map of this city.

It's a driving map. Not only that...

There are things marked on here with pencil,

so you wouldn't get lost!

How stupid are you?!

If I follow these directions in reverse,
I can see where you came from!

A vineyard!

You came from a vineyard that's
about twenty kilometers southeast!

Grazie, Narancia!

Now you can get eaten or have that
thing lay eggs in you or whatever,

you moron!

Tiny Feet

Formaggio

Twenty kilometers southeast!

The boss's daughter Trish
is somewhere in that area!

I did it! You don't have to talk anymore!

My Li'l Bomber has the ability to
detect and pursue carbon dioxide.

But carbon dioxide doesn't just
come from living creatures.

It's also produced by burning things.

I just remembered...

When I was chasing you with Li'l Bomber,

I also shot at the car.

I'm pretty sure I shot the gasoline tank...

But I can't really tell
where the hole is from here.

Still,

I was thinking that since the bullet
hole is technically burning, it'll have

carbon dioxide coming from it,
so I can find it using Li'l Bomber.

So I shot at it.

See, it wasn't the spider
I was shooting at earlier.

But it's a small hole,

so it took a while for the fire to actually
start, and I was getting nervous!

What?!

Damn it!

All the shopping bags got burned to a crisp!

Narancia's Height: 5.5cm -> 170.5cm (His normal height)

But it feels great to be back at a
size where a spider bite won't matter.

How dare you?!

I'm gonna murder all of your friends!

Hideout... Blergh!

Vineyard... Blah!

Just you wait, Narancia!

Tiny Feet!

Wh-What?!

He put out the fire with the blood
that squirted out of his wrist?!

Damn it! This isn't good!

Letting him get away now is not good at all!

I have to find him using Li'l Bomber's ability!

Sh-Shit!

Th-The radar...

These flames...

Y-You bastard! Where are you?!

Is this lucky or unlucky?

Narancia, because you set the car on fire,

you can't track me because of all the
carbon dioxide coming from the flames!

I guess if this comes down
to winning or losing, I've won!

You're not getting away!

I know where the boss's daughter is.

Now I just need to get out of
here and let my buddies know.

We'll murder you all!

Assassinations are our specialty!

Assassinations?

I'll make sure I pay you back for this soon!

You won't be able to find me anymore!

I win!

Boooooom

If I can't track your breathing...

If the flames are too big...

I'll just make them bigger!

If I set the whole damn street on fire,

you'll burn up and die because you're so tiny!

You're not getting away, Formaggio!

Are you mad, you bastard?

You actually set the whole street on fire!

Are you sane? You bastard!

Huh?!

I guess I don't need to set
the whole city on fire now.

When I asked if you were sane,

what you basically did was tell me that you
want me to kill you as soon as possible.

Thanks to the flames, I was
able to get this close to you.

Did you forget?

At this distance,
my Stand is faster than yours!

It might be.

Bring it, Narancia...

Tiny Feet!

Well, shit...

I guess your little shopping trip wasn't
as easy as you thought it'd be,

was it, Narancia?

Now things are going to get more difficult...

for you bastards!

"Go shopping," they tell me...

Mission... incomplete.

Both the money and the stuff I bought...

went up in flames...

Narancia, repeat it one more time.

I told you, the shopping—

Not that!

You just said the enemy
found out where we're hiding.

But I took care of him right after—

That's not the issue here!

Bucciarati, we should get
the hell out of here.

After I warned you so many times...

You fool!

I think Narancia did a great
job stopping the enemy.

I think he did everything he should've done.

And now that the Hitman Team knows
about us, if he's a reasonable boss,

he should give us a method of escape.

I don't think we should leave
until we hear from the boss.

Well, aren't you clever?

Do you think you're an advisor now?

And how do you know that the
boss will contact us soon?

No one cares about your damn hunches!

Bucciarati!

I think we got a message from the boss!

Message for Bucciarati

This is how the boss always
sends his orders to the capos.

This is the first time
Bucciarati's received one!

I'll check out the message.

"Head to the Pompeii Archaeological Park.
I've hidden a key near the dog mosaic."

Look into that immediately!

"That key is for a vehicle that'll
bring my daughter safely to me."

Vehicle? What does he mean by a safe vehicle?

A helicopter!

That must be a key to a helicopter!

We can go anywhere in a helicopter
without anyone following us!

It's a bit less than fifteen kilometers
from here to Pompeii.

An hour should be plenty of time
to get over there and get the key.

Fugo! Abbacchio! Giorno!

You three head to Pompeii and get that key!

Mista, Narancia, and I will remain here
and protect Trish from the Hitman Team.

Retrieve the key, and if
it seems safe, contact us.

Then we'll take Trish and
head to over to that vehicle.

I'm counting on you.

Episodio 12
The Second Mission from the Boss"Head to the Pompeii Archaeological Park.
I've hidden a key near the dog mosaic."

"That key is for a vehicle that'll
bring my daughter safely to me."

Fugo! Abbacchio! Giorno!

You three head to Pompeii and get that key!

Episodio 12  The Second Mission from the Boss

The city of Pompeii was known to the Romans
as a peaceful, prosperous health resort.

It was then abruptly destroyed
by the lapilli and lava

that came from the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius

on August 24th, 79 AD.

Later, archaeologists discovered
that all the houses, streets,

wine bottles, and even
carriage tracks left behind

were preserved as they were when
the volcano erupted 1,800 years ago.

The dog mosaic we're looking for

is located near the entrance of the
House of the Tragic Poet in Pompeii.

Oh, Fugo,

you were supposed to turn right
at that corner, not left.

You should've told me sooner, Giorno.

What point is there if you
tell me that after I turn?

You're exactly right.

I apologize. I'll be more careful next time.

That's not the point here, damn it!

Hey, Fugo.

We're in a hurry, so don't lose it now.

I know that!

Damn it...

Well, Fugo's always like this.

I'm more concerned about
this newbie, Giorno Giovanna.

If Bucciarati insists that I treat him
as one of us, I'll follow his orders,

but there's just something
I don't like about him.

This guy's going to do something...

Something that might get us killed.

Pompeii, huh?

I haven't been here since
I visited on a field trip as a kid.

Abbacchio, Giorno, let's hurry.

The place we're looking for
is about 100 meters ahead.

It should take us about thirty
minutes to get what we need

and get back to the others.

Abbacchio, Giorno, be on your guard.

To think we'd be found so soon...

How many are there?

One... for now.

He's peeking around that
stone pillar behind us.

Pillar? Which one would that be?

Wake up, Giorno.

There's only one pillar.

Can't you see it?

Fugo, there is definitely a single pillar,

but I don't see anyone, either.

Quit messing around!
He's heading right toward us!

Fugo?

There! The guy walking over here!

H-He was right there...

A guy came out from behind that pillar!

I saw him in this mirror!

Wh-What?!

There! He's right there! He's coming out!

H-He's inside the mirror?

He's revealed his Stand!
Who's going to fight him?!

Hold on, Fugo. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

Is something wrong with the mirror?

This isn't good! He's going to attack!

Get away from the mirror!

What?

Giorno! Abbacchio!

Wh-Where are you, Giorno? Abbacchio?

Where did you go?!

The guy who was in the mirror is gone, too.

What did he do?

It was bizarre to have a mirror hanging
in a place like this to begin with!

What in the world is this ability?

I don't...

I don't know what it is...

But there's something
off about this scenery.

I'm right here.

What?!

Pannacotta Fugo...

Highly intelligent, with an IQ of 152, and
entered university at the age of thirteen.

But he went berserk on a professor there

and beat him senseless with
a four-kilogram encyclopedia.

From then on, he spiraled
down to where he is now.

The ones who accompanied him are the
former cop Leone Abbacchio and...

No documents on the
other guy. He must be new.

I think I heard you call him Giorno.

What did you do to them?

Y-You bastard...

Where did you hide them?!

My watch is backwards?

Also, I was wearing it on my left
wrist, but now it's on my right?

D-Don't tell me this place is...

Your ability is—

I guess you're pretty quick on the uptake.

One at a time, Fugo...

It didn't really matter who was first,

but we'll start with you, since you
were the first to look at the mirror.

I-It wasn't Abbacchio and
Giorno that disappeared...

W-We're inside the mirror!

It was me!

I'm the one who was dragged in!

Fugo!

Where did you go, Fugo?!

Hey, Giorno!

Didn't you see anything?!

I'm not sure.

It looked as though he suddenly
disappeared to me, as well.

Fugo! Where did you go?!

Before he disappeared, Fugo yelled
at us to get away from the mirror.

And he asked whether we could see the
man walking from behind the the pillar.

This mirror...

Is there something... about this mirror?

The question is...

Where did you hide the boss's daughter?

That's the most important question...

But I'm pretty sure I also need to know why

you three came to Pompeii, the city of death.

I figure you're here to look for something...

And if that's the case, you came here to get
something that'll help you protect the girl,

isn't that right?

If you turn just up the way, it'll lead
you to the famous dog mosaic.

Is there something there?

Well?

I'll be taking it!

Tell me what you came here for, Fugo!

I refuse!

Then die!

No...

You'll be the one dying when
you witness my ability!

Purple Smoke!

My Stand won't appear?

I see... So your Stand
is named Purple Smoke.

Something's wrong. My Stand did come out.

I can feel it... So why?

Hey, Giorno...

Slowly walk toward me.

Slowly what?

Just come over here, you dumbass!

Forget the "slowly" part! Just get over here!

What?! Th-That's—

Giorno! Forget about that!

That's not our enemy! That's Fugo's Stand!

Just hurry up and get away from it!

Don't get any closer!

Fugo's—

Get away from Purple Smoke!

Hurry up!

Your current location is inside the mirror.

I'm sure you can figure out exactly
why I dragged you in here alone.

If I'd brought you in here
along with the others,

who can fight, it'd put me in danger!

I control the inside of the
mirror... That's my ability.

All the things in here are
objects that have no life.

You and I are the only living beings here.

That's because I didn't allow anyone else.

I only allowed you, and you alone, to come in.

Which means... your Stand
ability was left outside!

This is my Mirror Man!

Purple Smoke has appeared
outside the mirror.

Then there should be some way to fight!

Mirror Man

Illuso

Pannacotta Fugo was born
into a wealthy family

that owned a huge home
in the suburbs of Naples.

On top of being born into a life of luxury,

he was born with high intellect,
having an IQ of 152.

It appeared as though he
lived the perfect life.

But the weight of the expectations
that his parents and others

put on Fugo were slowly
crushing his young heart.

At times, Fugo would experience fits of
rage that even he didn't understand,

but he would do everything he
could to control them and get by.

Then, when he entered university
just after turning thirteen,

that rage went out of control
in the worst possible way.

Fugo.

Professor.

What are you doing here so late?

I'm working on the assignment due next week.
I couldn't find the right judicial precedent...

Oh, come on.

I told you that if there's anything you didn't
understand, you could come to me anytime.

No, I shouldn't keep bothering you...

My job is to teach and lead young people
like you in the right direction.

How about it?

Why don't you come by my house
again for dinner, and...

Please excuse me.

Now, wait just a moment.

I wouldn't mind telling you what's
going to be on the next test...

It'll be fine. Just relax, now.

Stop... Stop...

Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop!

I'll be gentle.

I told you to stop, damn it!

I looked up to you!

You piece of shit!

Did you hear?

Apparently Fugo's really close
with one of the professors.

Are you sure he wasn't
the one to lead him on?

That's probably how he got
into this school, too.

Fugo's parents used their money
to ensure he was found not guilty,

but they then treated him
like filth and disowned him.

All alone, Fugo started shoplifting
and picking pockets to survive.

Ironically, this lifestyle actually let him
use his intellect to its full potential.

You little bastard!
How dare you try to dine and dash?!

I'm gonna make sure they throw you in jail!

No, that won't be possible.

Are you familiar with the De Sica
vs. Argento case from 1982?

Going by that judicial precedent,

there's a very good chance that the court
will see this as me acting out of necessity.

Mr. Bucciarati!
Please say something to this brat!

Well, that sounds interesting.

That was right around the time Bucciarati
was thinking about creating his own team.

That basically sums up my life story.

Please don't pity me.

I don't think of myself as unfortunate.

I see. But, well...
I think our meeting is fate.

Would you like to join my
team, Pannacotta Fugo?

I want your intellect and knowledge.

Mr. Bucciarati, was it?

Joining a gang doesn't sound so bad,
but I've already made up my mind.

I'm going to live on my own,
not bothering with anyone else.

Oh? And why is that?

I told you.

When I lose my temper,
I do horrifying things.

If I were to join your team,
I might even end up killing you.

In that case, let's see if
that'll actually happen.

Come with me, Fugo.

I'll bring out the best in you,

including that fierce,
impulsive rage of yours.

Those words moved Fugo's heart.

After that, Fugo underwent Polpo's
test and gained Purple Smoke.

So this is Fugo's Stand...

Fugo's not here, but his Stand
appeared for some reason.

Since that thing appeared, Fugo must
be okay for the time being, but...

Damn it! Where the hell is Fugo?

How's he protecting himself?

Get back, Giorno!

Get back even further!

Fugo rarely lets this guy out.

He only does when he's in serious trouble.

Which means that Fugo's
trying to fight somewhere!

Get further back, Giorno!

He seems to be more worried about
that Stand than about where Fugo is.

He acts like he feels threatened.

What the? It just started
attacking out of nowhere!

This isn't good. We really shouldn't stay here.

We're getting out of here! Come on!

I don't know what you're talking about!

There's something in that mirror!

We need to find where Fugo is!

That's far more important right no—

Stop talking back to me, you little shit!

I don't care what happens to you,

but I'm trying to be nice and warn you,
since you don't know what's going on!

It punched it! Run, Giorno!

I see.

So you activated your Stand
outside the mirror.

But... that doesn't mean a thing!

It doesn't matter what your Stand
tries to do with its ability.

It will never be able to hit me.

But I can hit you as many times
as I like and finish you off!

A crow?

Why did a crow fall?

A crow just suddenly...

Stay back.

When Purple Smoke uses its
fists, no one can stay nearby.

What the hell is with these corpses?

It's a killer virus.

That's Fugo's Stand, Purple Smoke's ability.

A virus?

Look at its hand.

When it hits something with its
fist, that capsule breaks open,

and the virus comes spilling out!

The virus disperses into the
air and enters your body

through inhalation or skin contact.

It then multiplies rapidly.

It infects its host within thirty
seconds, then kills them instantly.

And once the virus spreads, it doesn't
matter who's nearby, be they friend or foe.

Just like those crows, all of your
metabolic functions will shut down,

and you'll die as you
rot from the inside out.

That includes your Stand, too.

What's its range?

Five meters.

Right now, Fugo should be
controlling his Stand

somewhere within five
meters of his opponent.

That's definitely important,
but what's the range on the virus?

How close do you have to be
to be infected by the virus?

At this distance, we should be safe.

The virus that comes from that capsule dies

within a few dozen seconds of exposure
to an average indoor level of light.

So those crow corpses will soon
be disinfected by the sunlight.

Savage!

It attacks like an explosion,
and then disappears like a storm.

It's a Stand that personifies
Fugo's violent nature.

What's it doing?

I think it's trying to wipe off the
drool that dripped on its leg.

It always looks pissed off,
but it's apparently

really high-strung, and really
cares about being clean.

I guess you could say that's
the Stand's idiosyncrasy.

It doesn't look like the Stand
itself is very intelligent...

It's just a reflection of his violent side.

That would also mean Fugo's
isn't able to see Purple Smoke.

He's not controlling it properly at all.

If he was, he wouldn't let it do that.

This corpse...

This crow...

Is it sick?

Was it infected by some virus or bacteria?

I knew it... Fugo's unable to control it.

It just attacked some random spot again.

Wait, is it actually random?

There must be something in that mirror!

Now the mirror got attacked
from the outside...

But it's no use, Fugo.

That's just a normal mirror,
the kind you can find anywhere.

No matter what your Stand
is doing out there...

No matter what ability it may use...

Not even viruses can enter
Mirror Man's world!

Abbacchio, Giorno, please get my message...

Please make sure you don't
get dragged into the mirror!

We need to hurry, Giorno!

Hey, Giorno!

Don't just stand there! Let's go!

Let me ask you this... Where are we going?

To get the key?

You're willing to abandon Fugo,
who's in danger right now?

Watch your mouth, you bastard.

Listen up. Our mission is to get the key
and safely get that girl to the boss!

I want to save Fugo as much as you do,

but getting that key is paramount right now!

Even if I was the one currently
being attacked instead of Fugo,

I would want you guys to abandon me.

I beg your pardon...

but I don't believe that's true!

Fugo is indeed in danger,
but he hasn't lost!

We should risk our lives and save him!

And making any movements when
we don't know the enemy's ability

is dangerous to us, as well.

No! All three of us being taken out
is the worst possible outcome!

I'll say it again! We're moving on! Come on!

And I humbly decline!

We're going to solve this mystery,
save Fugo, and defeat the enemy!

That's the best way to ensure we're all safe!

I have seniority here, so in this
situation, what I say goes!

Are you still going to decline?

You'd better be prepared!

That is, if you manage to survive!

I'll ask you one more time, Fugo.

What are you looking for here?

I have no intention of telling you.

I see.

Very well. There are still two others.

I just need the last one
standing to tell me.

You're finished. Take this!

Episodio 13
Mirror Man and Purple SmokeWhat are you looking for here?

I have no intention of telling you.

I see.

Very well. There are still two others.

I just need the last one
standing to tell me.

You're finished. Take this!

Footsteps... Someone outside
the mirror is running.

Does that mean your friends decided to

abandon you so that they
could go get something?!

They're heading toward the dog mosaic.

That settles it.

Fugo, you're basically done for already.

I'm going to go get whatever
that thing is first!

W-Wait, you bastard!

Abbacchio... Giorno...

Where is it? Where is this key?

There it is. That must be it.

A mirror?

Has that always been there?

What is that? A key?

What?

I see.

I guess I just have to
take that key from you.

That's... It couldn't be...

Now that you've seen me,

you're finished, too!

Episodio 13  Mirror Man and Purple Smoke

Sh-Shit!

Damn it...

I'm starting to understand
the enemy's ability.

So he's inside the mirror...

Assuming that's even possible.

Fugo must've been dragged into
the mirror and disappeared,

separating him from his Stand.

Regardless, right now,
I need to grab that key!

Shattering the mirror actually
worked in my favor, Abbacchio.

Anything reflected becomes
an entrance to this world.

Now that it's in shards, I have even
more entrances to grab you from!

And I'll give you, and only you,
permission to come into the mirror!

There! I've brought you in.

I'll be taking that key, too!

Wh-What?!

O-Only a Stand can grab the
neck of another Stand!

There's no way you could grab Mirror Man's neck
when I'm the one who dragged you in here!

Shattering the mirror didn't
actually work in your favor!

It just means the space you can look
outside from became smaller!

You couldn't see who you
dragged in here, could you?

You gave permission...

for just me to enter?!

Th-That's...

Grazie! I'll happily get dragged in!

Moody Jazz!

Shit! That's a Stand!

Inside the mirror...

So it's a world where everything's reversed.

Of course we couldn't know.

There's no way we'd comprehend this
ability until we were actually attacked.

Fugo must be in here, too.

So, how do we get out of here?

If I have to kill you to get
out of here, that's fine.

That's why I sent Moody Jazz in there!

The ability to transform into others...

Well, shit. You got me.

Looks like your Stand
itself isn't that strong.

So, what? Can it only
defeat powerless humans?

Well, what are you waiting for?
Get on your feet and come at me!

Listen up... Like I said at the start,
you're already done for.

I must say, I was a little surprised
when it was your Stand that came in,

but that doesn't change a thing!

The reason I'm not standing is
so that I can crouch down.

I'm crouching because I need to!

Well, yeah.

You're bent over to make it easier to kick you.

I was crouching so I could pick
up this shard of the mirror!

Hey, why are you so surprised?

Is it because I have this arm?

I'm sure you're very familiar with this arm!

I told you! Anything that
reflects becomes an entrance!

If I can get your reflection
with a different shard,

that becomes another entrance!

Do you get it now?

It's your arm that I dragged in here!

To make sure you can't move about,
I'll only allow half of your body to come in.

As for your Stand,
I permit half of it to get out!

Now your Stand won't be able to move!

The key's mine!

Damn it. He's going to take the key.

That doesn't just mean
we failed the mission.

It also means that Giorno
will end up being correct!

And I humbly decline!

We're going to solve this mystery,
save Fugo, and defeat the enemy!

That's the best way to
ensure we're all safe!

Damn it... My pride's not
going to stand for that!

I'm not letting him have that key!

I swear on my pride and my dignity
that I, Leone Abbacchio,

will protect this key!

It's true. Because Mirror Man uses
all its energy to drag someone in,

it doesn't have much destructive power.
That is indeed one of its traits!

But if I do this to you, we don't exactly
need strength to kill you off instantly!

If we just stab this in with the strength
of a four-year-old child, it's pretty easy.

I win! Thanks for telling
me where the key i—

Something wrong? Go on, finish me off!

What the hell are you doing, Abbacchio?!

How dare you hide it from me?!

Even if you can move with your
current body, it won't be much!

I'll be able to tell immediately! Get it?!

Hide?

What are you talking about?

What exactly did I hide, and where?

What the hell are you doing, you bastard?

Let me see that hand!

Seriously, what the hell are
you doing, you bastard?!

Did you lose something?

Did you find what you
were looking for? Well?

Why did he do that to his own hand?

Wait... If he chopped off his own hand,

his Stand's hand outside the mirror is...

It can't be...

Its hand is gone!

Don't tell me...

I-It has the key!

And it's going back!

If I remember correctly, a newbie named
Giorno is just around the corner!

He chopped off that hand
to give him the key?!

You should've sliced open my
throat when you had the chance.

If you had, my Stand's hand
would've stopped moving.

Whoops, so close. But you're a bit too late.

That was the sound of the key
falling to the ground.

The key is going to get picked up!

That's some bullshit you pulled off!

But I'm not letting that
brat named Giorno get away!

I'll drag him in here, too!

Do you understand now, Giorno, you shithead?!

All that matters is that
one of us returns safely.

If you return safely with the key...

The most important thing
is to fulfill the mission.

Hey, Abbacchio.

Can you even imagine what's
going on over here?

You sure have a loyal companion.

After you worked so hard
to deliver the key...

What do you think's going on over here?

Not a damn thing!

That brat's not running away at all!

It looks like he doesn't
have a clue what's going on.

Giorno! Get the hell out of here!

Take the key and run!

He won't hear you when you're
screaming inside this mirror!

Sh-Shit...

Now then, there are two
possible actions I could take.

First is disposing of Giorno
after I get the key.

Second is slitting Giorno's throat first,
then safely retrieving the key.

Let's see...

I guess I'll slit Giorno's throat first!

He's noticed me.

I'll allow only Giorno to enter!

I've dragged him in!

Slice open his throat, Mirror Man!

Wh-Wh-What?!

H-He's... That's impossible!

It's the virus! G-Giorno...

He's been infected by Fugo's Purple Smoke!

You're not getting the key!

And Fugo, Abbacchio, and I...
will safely return to the others!

Pannacotta Fugo

Purple Smoke

Giorno Giovanna... That brat
doesn't understand anything!

You're going to die if you infect
yourself with Purple Smoke's virus!

My heart died along with him back then.

I don't feel anything anymore.

I don't feel a damn thing,
even though I've lost my hand...

The only time I can feel at ease

is when I'm following the orders
of something great and absolute.

Because then, all I need to do is be a
soldier who doesn't have to think for himself.

Meaning...

Getting the key and protecting
the boss's daughter...

Carrying out this mission is
the most important thing.

And yet Giorno... That stupid brat...

He chose to put himself in danger to

save Fugo and me, rather than
taking the key back safely!

Damn you, you stupid brat!

How dare you come in here infected?!

Are you out of your damn mind?!

Now I'm infected, damn it!

Ah, yes. You seem to be experiencing
the same symptoms as me.

Apparently Purple Smoke's virus infects
your whole body within thirty seconds.

It's over now.

It was over as soon as you dragged me in.

Shards of the mirror that
Purple Smoke shattered...

Did Giorno put them back together?

When the enemy chased after Abbacchio,
he took some shards with him.

Giorno must've realized that!

He then figured out the
enemy's ability from that,

then infected himself with the virus and

allowed himself to be
dragged into the mirror!

Because there's no other
way to defeat this enemy!

Damn it! Of all the underhanded...

But don't underestimate me.

It's not too late yet.

I need more resolve,
but it's not too late yet!

Mirror Man! Allow only me
to leave this mirror!

But don't allow the virus!

The part of me that's infected
is not allowed to leave!

That's not good!

If he gets outside, the virus
will be separated from him!

Abbacchio lopped off his
own hand to get the key.

So, I, Illuso, c-can do the same thing!

This is nothing!

Giorno! Grab him!

He got away...

Giorno... After you...

risked your own life to come in here...

So... he stepped outside the mirror.

Th-That was really close, but, ha!

My resolve... My resolve wins in the end!

This is nothing!

I figured he'd go outside.

That's for the best, though.
He's going down, no matter what.

Now that he's stepped outside,
there's a chance I might survive!

Fugo! Now that he's outside,
Purple Smoke can follow him!

Finish him off!

I can't, Giorno.

I can't tell where he is from inside here.

I have no way to attack him!

I know where he is.

Golden Wind, who's outside,
turned that brick into a snake.

That's why it's moving.

Snakes can tell where humans are
by sensing their body temperature.

Got him!

What?!

A-After I built up the resolve to chop
off my own arm and came out here...

This... This can't...

S-Stop it! Stop! Damn it!

I'm going to be infected!
I-If that virus capsule bursts...

I-It looks like luck hasn't
completely abandoned me!

If Mirror Man can stop this thing's
punch even for a moment...

If I can just block it once...

Let him have it, Purple Smoke!

Mirror Man! Use everything you have left!

I...

I did it...

I stopped it!
Now I just need to take this arm...

into the mirror!

Huh?

What?!

What?!

B-But I blocked its punch...

After I built up the resolve...
to leave the mirror!

W-We did it! We're outside the mirror!

We defeated him, so his ability disappeared!

B-But Giorno, Purple Smoke's virus has
already spread throughout your body.

Once you've been infected,
even I can't do anything about it.

Yes, Fugo, and this is how it should be.

This...

Him leaving the mirror
worked out for the best.

Once I was infected and he
dragged me into the mirror,

his defeat was inevitable.

But I was glad when he refused to
admit defeat and left the mirror.

Since the mirror world
was undone before I died,

I was able to encounter this snake.

Th-That snake...

It's alive, even though it's
surrounded by Purple Smoke's virus!

I created this snake from the brick where
Purple Smoke's capsule was broken.

Since it was born from a place that was
covered with the virus, it won't get sick.

Do you know what that means?

That snake has immunity!

And if we take blood or cells
from something with immunity...

We can create a serum that'll
stop the virus from spreading!

Golden Wind!

Extract the serum from this
snake and inject it into me!

Giorno Giovanna...

I thought he was some newbie
that I just couldn't figure out,

but he comes up with the most insane
ideas and pulls them off...

And there's something
I can trust behind that.

It's not something that's spoken.

He has true loyalty within him!

Just like Bucciarati did back then!

Giorno! You have my utmost
respect after risking your life!

No, Fugo...

I'm not the one who risked my life here.

I just made a prediction
and followed through.

The one who truly risked his
life here... was Abbacchio.

His hand is in grave condition right now.

He's the one who risked his
life to protect the key...

And if he hadn't carried
the key all the way here,

we couldn't have defeated the enemy.

Please don't worry about me...
and go tend to his wounds...

Giorno!

Are you okay, Giorno?!

Damn it, Giorno...

I was going...

to beat the shit out of you...

But with my hand like this, I guess I can't.

I'll just have to do it later...

Thus, they got the key
they were ordered to retrieve!

Special Program
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Golden WindLet me see the key we obtained again,

Narancia.

Huh?

Here.

Wait! Don't throw it!

You little shit!

Dang, talk about overreacting.

Isn't the fact that you're
feeling pain a good sign?

I just had it reattached thirty minutes ago...

It still hurts, damn it!

"I thank you for protecting
my daughter, Bucciarati.

Go to the drinking fountain with a turtle
on the sixth platform at Naples Station,

and use this key.

Then, take my daughter to Venice by train.

P.S. My missions for you will
end once you get to Venice."

What's supposed to be by the
drinking fountain at the station?

The boss mentioned a way for us to travel
without being found by the enemy.

The station is dangerous, but we'll
just have to trust him and go.

D-Do you think the boss
is actually in Venice?

Since it's mentioned in that note...

We don't need to think about that.

We're just going to do as we're ordered.

There's a super express leaving for
Florence in ten minutes. We'll take that.

Mista, is anyone following us?

So far, we're good.

I can't say the same for the station, though.

There'll be plenty of paid guys
who'll report information about us.

The boss's daughter, Trish.

Her life is being targeted because
of a father she's never met.

I wonder how that feels...

Yeah, I get it, Fugo...

I can't help but stare at her
you-know-whats, either.

Huh?

Th-That's...

Please forgive Fugo!

He didn't mean any harm!

He wasn't trying to take
advantage of the sudden braking

to see your breasts or stroke
your thighs under your skirt!

He just couldn't help himself!

Hey, stop that!

I actually lost my balance,
but you're making it sound worse!

Please don't tell the boss!

Episodio 14  Express Train to Florence

Florence bound leaving at 16:35 from platform 6

He's really here. That's Bucciarati.

I can't believe he actually showed up at
a station where we could easily find him.

I'm gonna kill him!

Maybe he was pushed to his
limits and lost his mind,

or he's somehow confident that
he'll be able to give us the slip.

Either way, I'm gonna kill him!

He killed Formaggio and Illuso!
I'm gonna kill him!

Hey, dumbass.

Drop the "I'm gonna kill him" crap already.

That phrase doesn't exist in our world.

Only weaklings use that phrase.

Because when I or my other team
members so much as think those words,

our target is already dead,
and the job is over!

So I've never uttered
those words in my life.

You're gonna be that way too, right, Pesci?

If you're truly one of us.

Do you understand what I'm saying?

Yeah... I got it, Bro!

You can say, "I killed them!"

Prosciutto...

I'm going to head straight
over there via the platform.

Pesci, you board the train
and head to the lead car.

Got it!

We'll flank him.

We need the boss's daughter alive, after all.

Bucciarati, the train's about to leave.

Is something wrong?

There's no other drinking fountain
on this platform, is there?

This key won't fit into this keyhole.

Not to mention...

you don't even need a key to open it.

It's just a stopcock.

Bucciarati, how about the
lock on that fire hydrant?

The shape's completely different.

There aren't any locks or
doors that this key will fit.

They just aren't here!

Should we pass on this train?

The next one departs in fifteen
minutes and is bound for Rome.

No!

I'm sure some of our enemies know we're
here and are heading to the station now.

We have to leave here immediately!

The sixth platform...

The drinking fountain with the turtle...

This has to be the spot!

Damn it! What's—

The turtle...

Hey, Pesci, why the hell am
I running into you here?

I-I could ask you the same thing!
Where did Bucciarati go?

Bucciarati hopped onto the
train right in front of me.

It makes no sense that he didn't
bump into you in the hallway.

Well? I'm right, aren't I?

I didn't run into anyone!

Bucciarati, his crew, the newbie, and the
boss's daughter definitely aren't here!

Something's strange...

Bro, the train's about to leave.

They must be hiding somewhere
inside this station.

They're gonna keep an eye on us tracking
them and hop on another train to get away.

Let's use some homeless guy or
something to search the station!

There was something placed
at the drinking fountain.

He must've picked it up.

He picked up something that looked black!

Get on, Pesci!

But why?!

I just have a hunch.

I don't know how,

but I think Bucciarati and the
others are somewhere on this train.

You think?

You think?!

I'm sure the boss is helping them out somehow.

I have a feeling that if we don't board
this train, we'll lose them forever!

A feeling?

Just shut up and get on, Pesci!

It takes takes three and a half hours to
get from Naples to Florence by train.

It's an hour and a half non-stop
to the next stop, Rome.

Aw, we ended up getting on...

Shut up!

Hey, the gap between the door and floor...

What's on the other side of this door?

Isn't that the driver's cab?

But there's no way seven guys are in there.

You never know.

Use your Fisher Man to attack that room.

Do it.

Fisher Man!

There aren't seven guys in here...

There are two!

Got 'em!

Damn it. It really is small in there.

I guess there's only the driver.

But they're definitely
somewhere on this train.

Huh? Hey, wait a second.

There's only one?

I know I sensed two living things in there.

I could've sworn there was one more...

Hey, Pesci!

We're going to search this
train from end to end!

We'll drag Bucciarati and his crew out!

But you stay here.

Huh?

If they realize we're here,
they might come to stop the train.

You got it, Bro!

They have the girl with them,

so they shouldn't be able to just move
around or jump off this train easily.

That's going to give us our advantage.

We'll slaughter them all before
we get to Rome and take the girl!

The key wasn't made to fit in a keyhole.

It actually fit right into this turtle's shell.

That, in turn, somehow
activated the turtle's ability,

creating this space and making the key itself
the entrance so that we could hide inside.

Th-The turtle is a Stand user?

O-Ow!

Wh-Where the hell am I?

I'm under the seat?

Ow!

B-But man, this is awesome!

This turtle is like some kind of spaceship!

But this room isn't some kind of illusion.

This is a real room.

Even the sofa and other furniture is real.

There are some chilled drinks in here.

I guess the boss left them in there for us.

Turtles like being in the shade, they aren't
loud, and they don't scuttle about.

This way, we should be able to get
to Venice by train without worry.

I guess there's no way someone
would be in the locker...

I just don't have my bro's intuition.

B-Bro!

D-Don't tell me he...

The Thankful Death!

A-Are you really going to do it?

You're going to do in all of the passengers?!

We don't even know if they're on this train!

I already told you

that I would be thorough about this!

They're definitely here.

What's the big deal, anyway?

Every year, there are lots of
train crashes all over the world.

This won't be as brutal as those.

Mr. President

Coco Large

It's probably because we're
in a room inside a turtle,

but it's sorta muggy in here.

You want a drink, too, Narancia?

There are only cold drinks,
but there's cola, mineral water,

carbonated, non-carbonated, apple juice,
orange juice, and pineapple juice.

Hey, are you even listening?

Huh? What was that?!

I'm asking if you want something to drink!

Why don't you get some rest while you're at it?

You look pretty tired.

I'll keep an eye on the ceiling.

Oh, okay!

My shoulders suddenly feel stiff,
and my back hurts. There we go...

I'd really like something warm...

Something that won't upset my stomach.

I told you, there are
only cold drinks in here!

You never listen, do you?!

I'll just eat this banana, then.

Man, gardens like these make me sigh.

They're so calming...

They're so beautiful...

I'd love to drown in nostalgia and
think back on when I was a kid

while I just lay out in the
sun in a garden like this.

Hey, stop that!

Licking your finger before
you turn the page is gross!

Huh? Did I do that?

Me? No way!

Hey, there's something
hanging from your mouth.

Talk about gross. What the hell is that?

Hey!

A tooth?

I can't eat this banana for some reason...

It's all hard and dry...

Hey... Are you messing with us?

Man, you startled me...
That sort of looks like a tooth.

I'm still pretty grossed out,
so I can't really laugh...

What is that hanging from your mouth?

Huh? Did you say something again... Mista?

You're speaking too softly...

I couldn't hear you very well...

I'm telling you, this banana is crumbling...

I-I can't eat it...

Th-They're all dry...

A-All the fruits are dry...

Wh-What the hell is wrong with you?!

Didn't you hear me? Okay, then...

There's something wrong with your face!

N-Narancia, you...

I'll say it even louder this time!

Are you paying attention?!
I can't eat this banana!

Look. It's just crumbling...

It's old, damn it...

Bucciarati!

I know! It's a Stand attack!

Th-There must be an enemy on this train!

Huh? What? What's this white stuff?

It came from my head...

What the hell is this?!

What's the matter?

Did something... happen?

Th-They've all aged!

Mama... Wake up... Wake up...

Mama... Mama...

Wake up...

Wh-Who the hell is th-this?

What? No way... This can't be!

This is me?!

What the hell's going on?

A-A Stand that makes people age?

Did they figure out we're in this turtle?!

Calm down, Mista.

If they knew we were inside this turtle,
they would've used a more direct attack.

And since they haven't,
that means we haven't been found yet.

The enemy probably only knows that
we're somewhere on this train

and, in order to find her,

they're attacking everyone
on the train indiscriminately!

D-Does that mean this train is running
with everyone on board affected?

Probably.

They're desperate.
I'm sure they'll do anything...

And without a second thought.

This leaves us two choices.

One, take Trish and somehow
get off this train.

Two, we find this enemy, even though we
don't know their range, and dispose of them.

Obviously, we'll go with the second choice.

If we want to take her and run,
we'll have to stop the train.

It's too dangerous.

Assassinating them is more definitive,

with my Six Bullets!

Yes, you're right.

But we don't have any time.

We're aging at an alarming rate...

B-Bucciarati...

M-My hands...

Th-They're crumbling!

They're falling apart!

You're right, Bucciarati.
We really don't have any time!

Wait a minute, Mista...

It's too early... to go...

What the hell are you talking about, Giorno?

I'm telling you... it's too early to go...

We don't have any time to waste!

Wait.

Hear him out.

What are you trying to say, Giorno?

Why are we all aging at a
different rate than Bucciarati?

Mista's and my symptoms are light...

Trish's are even less!

But why?

Apparently, we're just aging at
different rates! I'm going!

No... If they're attacking everyone
indiscriminately with age...

They might end up killing her as well,
despite her being the target.

There's some kind of prerequisite
to how fast we're aging.

I'll tell you what I think...

I think the enemy is differentiating between

men and women by the difference
in their body temperature.

I read somewhere that women have more
fat in their bodies, which makes them

less susceptible to temperature fluctuations.

Apparently women also age better
and live longer than men.

Don't you think it's been a little hot?

The enemy is differentiating
the aging speed based on

slight differences in body temperature.

All that matters is that the men
age faster and she ages slower.

Yeah, that sounds about right,

but then why are you and I
aging at different rates?

Are you insinuating that I'm a girl?!

Change in body temperature...

Come to think of it,
our bodies were slightly cooler...

Because we had something cold to drink.

Narancia didn't have anything to drink.

Th-That's...

Giorno, it's exactly like you said!

We're aging slower because our
bodies were slightly cooler!

Cool everyone down!
Cool everyone down with ice!

Hold it, Mista!

You're going to have to
take that ice with you!

Th-This is all that's left?

It doesn't change the fact that
we have to dispose of this enemy.

Mista, you're going to take
that ice and defeat the enemy...

Before the ice melts and
you lose your Stand power!

Just the driver... It doesn't look
like anyone else is in here.

It's so muggy...

This Stand really is
attacking indiscriminately.

I wonder if this turtle is aging, too...

But they say that turtles
live for 10,000 years.

Guess they live longer than us.

Damn it...

What's Bro thinking? This is so dangerous.

What's he gonna do if I
get old, too? Damn it...

The air conditioner?

If I turn it on inside the driver's cab,
everyone in the turtle will cool down,

and that might slow down their aging!

There it is!

Something took the bait!

Wh-What the hell is this needle-like thing?!

A d-different Stand than
the one that's aging us?

There's another one? There are two of them?

There are two enemies?!

Episodio 15
The Thankful Death Part 1Let me see the key we obtained again.

Go to the drinking fountain with a turtle

and use this key.

Don't tell me he...

The Thankful Death!

Just the driver... It doesn't look
like anyone else is in here.

There it is!

Something took the bait!

Wh-What the hell is this needle-like thing?!

A d-different Stand than
the one that's aging us?

Bro, where did you go?!

Episodio 15  The Thankful Death Part 1

Why aren't you here?!

Bucciarati and his crew were on this train!

But I wonder who I hooked.
It's definitely not Trish.

The strength pulling on
this rod belongs to a man.

The needle dug into his left hand.

He weighs 68 kilograms!

I'll reel you right in!

Whoa, hang on a second...
Th-This needle's sinking in deeper!

It's so fast!

It's moving up my arm at incredible speed!

Th-This line...

This must be Mista!

The thing that tried to cut
the line was a bullet!

The gunslinger is Guido Mista!

You can't cut my Fisher Man's line!

I wonder where the impact that
hit the line will end up going?

I'm gonna reel you right in!

I need to get this line out or I'm finished!

Damn it! It's going to make
its way up to my brain!

Sh-Shit!

Six Bullets! Grab this hook and stop it!

I-It's no use! We're being pulled!

We can't stop it with our power!

Sh-Shit... I'm just going
to have to look for it.

I'm just gonna have to find it!

Find it!

Find it!

We need to find it, no matter what!

Find it!

What was that?

Was that Mista's pistol?

Who the hell are you even shooting at?

What if you hit one of the other passengers?

Or did you shoot in hopes
that you'd actually hit me?

It's no use!

The hook is about to travel
deep into your ear!

We have to aim lower or the ice
won't get blown out of the glass!

A bit lower! Aim a bit lower!

Over here! Blast right into it!

We found the ice!

Shatter it, boys!

What do you think you're doing?!

I knew that bastard would
be cooling himself, too,

to the point that he'd lose his mind!

Damn it!

How could you?! The ice...

He's all pale and screaming.
My ice!

Could this guy be...

It's him!

He's the guy with the line and hook!

That fishing-rod-looking thing is his Stand!

R-Run for it!

Ice! I need to find some ice,
or I'm going to die of old age, too!

H-Help me...

O-Out of my way, gramps!

Get your zombie hands off of—

My body feels so heavy,
I don't want to move...

I ordered the really fatty steak,

but now I don't want to eat it anymore...

Don't touch me!

Woohoo! We got his hand!

Call Mista over here now!

Mista!
Hurry up and get over here, Mista!

Mista, over here!

We found the enemy Stand user!

Six Bullets, all of you
come back to the bullets.

It doesn't really matter
if you answer me or not,

but I'm going to ask you one very, very...

simple question.

If you don't answer within two
seconds of me asking the question,

I'll shoot a bullet into each of your eyes.

"Uno, due..." I won't wait any longer than that.

Got it?

All right. Here's the question.

Where the hell is your friend?

Uno...

H-Hell if I know!
I don't know where he is, either!

Due... All right. Then die.

Hey... Please help me...

I've always loved fatty steak so much,

but now I don't wanna eat it anymore...
Hey! Get out of the way! You'll want
to eat meat again soon enough!

No, I can't eat anything anymore...

Or rather, you won't be able to,

Mista.

Wh-Who the hell are you?!

Thankful Death...

Huh? Wh-What?

W-Wait! Are you...

You bastard!

It works even faster when
I directly touch you.

Its power is at full strength...

when Thankful Death touches you.

B-Bullets...

Th-This speed... Shit...

I-Is that you, Bro?

Are you my Bro?!

I-I didn't notice at all!

Y-You were there the whole time?

I-I can't believe you aged yourself to
blend in with the other passengers...

Bro! Prosciutto! You're so awesome!

S-Stop! Why are you so mad, Bro?!

You friggin' moron!
What the hell was that?! Huh?!

I didn't know he was going to ambush me!

What could I do?!

You still don't get it?
Pesci, you friggin' mammoni!

Please stop hitting me, Bro!

Listen up! The reason I'm mad is
because you're so weak-minded, Pesci!

Of course, they did blast away
your ice, so you were in shock.

This is aging me, too, so it's bad news.

But if it were any other guy from our team,

they wouldn't have made their
Stand go away when they were

that close to finishing off an enemy!

Even if they lost an arm or a leg!

You're a damn mammoni, Pesci.

You freaked out. You're such a baby.

It's not because of the ice.

You're actually scared
deep inside your heart.

Grow up, Pesci.

If you don't grow up,
we'll never get our glory.

We'll never defeat Bucciarati and his crew.

And just so we're clear...

Our team isn't some buddy-buddy
club with a bunch of losers

who just talk about killing people
while trying to cheer each other up.

Once we decide in our hearts
that we're gonna kill someone,

the deed's already been done!

Let's go, Pesci.

Here, have some ice.

You mentioned earlier

that you sensed another presence
in the driver's cab, didn't you?

I don't know how they're hiding in there,

but the girl's in the driver's cab!

Prosciutto

The Thankful Death

Don't worry about Narancia!

Save the ice in the glass for yourself!

You need to keep your body chilled.

Fanning air and the chill from
a cold towel aren't enough.

There's no effect unless you use ice.

At this rate, he'll be the first to die.

Narancia and the rest of us are willing to
risk our lives to follow the boss's orders.

You just need to think about your safety.

That's our job.

You're not here because you
want to be here, after all.

And as for the enemy who's
causing us all to age...

Mista will take care of him.

I'm sure... he'll do something...

Mista...

Where and how are they hiding?

I'm finally getting it.

I need to start thinking in
four dimensions to find them.

Bucciarati received something black at
the station platform from the boss.

That's it. That's what I need
to find in this driver's cab.

Hey, Pesci.

What do you think that presence
you felt in this driver's cab was?

You don't feel it now?

A-About that... Bro...

You shouldn't expect much from me.

I'm not the brightest.

Pesci, Pesci, Pesci, Pesci...

I believe in you.

If you're still concerned about
me yelling at you earlier,

you just need to be more confident.

Your Fisher Man is unbeatable
when you actually apply yourself.

Right?

That presence you felt earlier
is extremely suspicious.

It's do or die time, Pesci.

It's okay to be confident in your ability.

R-Really?

Yes!

Try to remember. It doesn't
matter how trivial it seems.

Did anything seem strange?

Like maybe something black?

Huh? Something... black?

That's it, Bro!

I meant to look under
the driver's seat earlier!

There was something weird!

S-Sorry... I guess I was just imagining it.

So, yeah... You shouldn't count
on me or my intuition, after all...

No, I don't think you're wrong.

Say what?!

Excellent work, Pesci.

The mystery's been solved.

I now understand everything thanks to you.

B-Bro? Wh-What are you...

Why is there suddenly animal
shit under the driver's seat?

I don't understand at all!

This isn't mouse shit, either.

If it were a mouse, it'd be dead by now.

This shit's not old.
It looks like it was just left here.

So what does that mean, huh?

Stand abilities don't only belong to humans.

And that means...

This animal is moving through the shadows!

Thankful Death!

Wh-What the hell is that?!

I-It's a turtle? It's a friggin' turtle?!

We found her! It's Trish!

I can see the others, too!

Just as I thought, they're all about
to die of old age, except for Trish!

That settles it!

I'll send even more of the
aging ability into the turtle!

Thankful Dead!

Wait a sec, Bro!

Isn't there... one guy missing?

There's someone missing in there!

Mista! Please get up!

This is all the ice I have left,
but please feel better!

I'm not sure if it's thanks
to my attentive nature,

or if I was just lucky...

But because I put that piece of ice
I'd picked up earlier into my hat...

Number Five... It seems you
were able to reverse the aging.

Thanks for stopping those bullets
for me... All three of them.

Number Five... I have one more request...

If you want to send one of us to Bucciarati,

I already revived Number Six,
and he went on ahead!

He took the ice in your pocket and

went to tell them that two enemies
were heading for the turtle!

That's perfect... I don't
need the ice anymore...

after all...

Mista!

It's Bucciarati, Bro!

Bucciarati's the one missing!

It doesn't matter if Bucciarati's
in there or not!

All that matters is that we take Trish alive!

Thankful Death!

What the hell?!

You're pretty intuitive... And fast, too.

I just have to defeat him, right?

The one in black!

That's right, Bucciarati!

If you defeat him,
everyone's aging will be reversed!

What the hell is Mista's Stand doing here?!

I personally blasted three
holes into his head...

So why is that thing here with an ice cube?!

Don't let that thing touch you!

If it does, you'll age way, way faster!

Get 'em!

H-He's fast...

Bro!

Don't worry about me!

Deal with the guys in the turtle!

Hurry it up! Kill the rest of his crew!

That was a little naïve,
wasn't it, Bucciarati?

After Mista went to all that
trouble to warn you...

Defeating me, even if it costs the lives
of your crew, to protect the girl...

Isn't that your mission?

You fail as a capo. Take this!

What?!

I will complete this mission,

and I will also protect my crew.

It won't be hard for me to do both
if I'm only facing the likes of you.

It's fast...

It's definitely fast...

Your... Zipper Man, was it?

It's definitely faster...

But you're the one who doesn't seem
to understand speed, Bucciarati!

I seem to be out of breath...

But the same goes for you, Bucciarati.

Since we used our Stands at full speed,
we both used up a lot of energy.

You didn't comprehend that and
tried to go as fast as you could,

even though you're still aging
despite standing still!

The more horsepower a car has,
the warmer it gets!

That's because you're burning calories.

You're a smart guy, so I'm
sure you can figure out...

what'll happen when your body gets warmer!

B-Bucciarati!

Th-The ice is starting to lose its effect!

So what are you going to do now, huh?

This zipper you gave me
is starting to close.

The zipper on my chin is already gone.

What's the matter?

Exhausted from your stiff shoulders?

Zipper Man!

I can see your movements!
You're too slow, Bucciarati!

I've got you! Now you're all finished!

And then we'll be taking
the boss's daughter!

I was aware of what would
happen if my body warmed up.

I was also prepared to get caught.

I will complete this mission.

I will also protect my crew.

One of the hardest parts of being a
capo is the fact that I have to do both.

Are you prepared?

I am.

Wha—

Y-You can't mean...

You bastard! You can't be serious!

Doing both is simple,

if I can get you off this train.

If I can just undo the aging,
my five subordinates will be back,

and we'll be able to protect Trish!

You bastard! Y-You can't be serious! Let go!

We're moving at 150 kilometers per hour!

Oh, come on, now. You're
the one who grabbed me.

Are you trying to die?! You bastard!

Episodio 16
The Thankful Death Part 2Episodio 16  The Thankful Death Part 2

Pesci! What the hell are you doing?!

Pesci!

Hurry up and stop the train!

Pesci!

B-Bro!

Stop the train!

Bro!

I-I don't know how to stop it!

Now you and your aging ability
will both disappear.

Then my crew will return to
normal, and Trish will be safe!

You bastard...

Bucciarati!

Bro!

What?!

Prosciutto!

W-Well done, Pesci!

Excellent work! That was quick thinking!

That was close...

I almost didn't make it, but thank
goodness I managed to hook him!

Now my hook will never let him go!

B-But this is definitely
the weight of two people!

Bucciarati must be hanging on, too!

I seriously thought I was
done for, Bucciarati.

I called you a failure of a capo,
but I take that back now.

I apologize for my rudeness.

You are able to make decisions impartially.

You're even able to risk your own life.

The boss made the right decision,
leaving Trish in your hands.

I'm actually astonished.

However, Bucciarati...

You're an unlucky capo!

Now, fall into the hell of
150 kilometers per hour!

Zipper Man!

Did you forget?

You're still aging as we speak!

Too slow!

You know... I was saved by that
line your little bro sent out.

He wasn't aiming for me.

Could I actually be the unlucky one?

There was no way Mista
should have been alive!

I fired three bullets straight into his head.

The fact that he's alive

is as messed up as someone
saying the sun rises in the west!

I happened to let him know

that the energy from an attack on the line

gets sent back to the one who's hooked!

Impossible!

Bucciarati!

It's one person lighter now!

We must've thrown Bucciarati off!

We did it, Prosciutto!

Looks like the aging is wearing off.

Now we just have to deal
with the fishing hook guy!

Yeah.

Earlier, my Fisher Man's hook definitely
dug into Bro's right hand...

His pinky was on the right
side of the hook.

But right now...

The pinky is on the left side of the hook.

This is someone's left hand!

What the heck's going on?

Whose hand is on the other end?

How did Bro's right hand
switch to his left?!

N-Now that I think about it...
Bro also seems just a bit heavier...

H-Hey, you!

Make them stop the train!
I think everyone on this train is sick!

I'm starting to feel much better, but...

I've lost some teeth!
Th-The aging has stopped!

Hey, are you listening to me?!

Have the driver stop the train, quick!

It can't be...

Don't tell me the weight that
was flung from the line was...

It can't be!

It can't be! It can't be true!

Don't tell me that Bro...

Are you listening to me, you dumbass?!

I'm talking to you! You, right there!

My bro, Prosciutto!

What should I do? What should I do?

What am I supposed to do?

No way! The guys inside the turtle
are going to come out, too!

Wh-What should I do? What should I...

What the hell are you even saying?!

I'm telling you to make them stop the train!

Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

Shut up, damn it!

You some kind of mammoni?!

Fine. I'm starting to feel better,
so I'll tell them my—

Wh-What's going on?

The aging hasn't stopped!

Bucciarati, y-you're...

Impossible...

Don't tell me... Don't tell me he...

What?!

Thankful... Death...

Bro!

You were right, Bro...
You were totally right.

You said we should never

release our Stand ability once we've gotten
a hold of them, even if we lose a limb...

Bro...

With the mess his body's in,
th-there's no way he can survive...

He's going to die any second now,

and yet he isn't releasing his Stand's ability!

We have to get Trish,
no matter what, right, Bro?

We can't turn back now...

I get it now, Prosciutto!

I understand your resolve

not as mere words,

but within my heart.

Once we think of killing someone, Bro,

the deed has already been done!

That's the first time I did someone in.

But it wasn't as big of a deal
as I thought it'd be.

And now, there's no one left

to call me a mammoni.

Pesci

Fisher Man

I'm going to settle this once and for all

before Bro's ability disappears!

Bucciarati! You need to hurry
up and remove that hook!

Yeah.

You opened up your hand with a zipper.

He can tell what I'm trying to do?

I'll read all of his actions!

I'll make the hook travel from his hand
down his wrist and to his forearm!

The hook's traveling further up your arm!

The hook is out again!

It's no use. Whenever I try
to get the hook out,

he reads my moves
within a few centimeters!

And he's powerful!

I'm not going to lose track of your body!

And I'm going to get Trish and make sure
Prosciutto's will is seen through!

Bucciarati! The bastard down there!

If we finish him once and for all,
Giorno and the others will stop aging

and take care of the fishing line guy!

I know, but that's proving
quite difficult to do, too!

I'll make you suffer the same
agony my Bro is going through!

Bucciarati!

He's hanging on to something.

In that case... You can just go up!

You're heading right for
those electrical wires!

Get chopped in half!

I felt an impact, but he didn't
get chopped in half or fall off.

I feel a heartbeat through the line.

Bucciarati is still alive.

He's entered the train!

That was close, Bucciarati!

At this point, we're gonna
have to face him head-on!

Yes... But that's going
to be difficult, as well.

We won't make it in time.

The hook has now entered my chest!

What?!

The distance between the hook and
your heart is now twelve centimeters...

Eleven centimeters...

I underestimated the situation.

The enemy that posed a
greater threat on this train

wasn't the one who could age everyone.

The one who's even more terrifying

is the guy using this fishing line!

So what are you gonna do?!

The hook's gonna dig into your heart soon!

Nine centimeters, eight centimeters...

Then I don't have any choice.

In order to defeat his ability,

I'm just going to have to show him

that my resolve is superior to his!

Zipper Man!

What the hell are you doing?!

Bucciarati!

He disappeared!

I can't feel his pulse or the
vibration from his breathing...

Why?!

How did I lose his presence?

How?!

How can you do something
so insane, Bucciarati?!

I know there's no other way...

But seriously, are you going to be okay?!

Quiet... down.

Wait until he goes away.

This is what it means to have
resolve... Number Six.

Damn it, I can't find him!

Bucciarati can go anywhere with his zippers!

Could he be heading here
from s-some direction?

No, wait. Calm down...

Jumping at shadows is a sign of weakness!

That's what Prosciutto would tell me!

Be more confident, Pesci.

It doesn't matter if
you're on a moving train.

I'm sure you can find him
by sensing his heartbeat.

That's what he'd say!

There's no way Bucciarati
can move quickly right now!

He must still be somewhere near the hook!

H-He's extending the line even further!

Quickly, pull yourself together and run!

For now...

he's lost sight of me.

I can make it through this
as long as I don't move.

The fact that I'm not
doing anything right now

shows my resolve.

His heartbeat, his pulse...
Look for those two things.

Borgh

Got one! But that's not him!

The weight isn't right.

It must be another passenger!

This is... It's weakened,
but that's the sound of a heart!

N-No! He's going to find your heart!

How could you do such a thing?!

He said he wasn't going to do anything,

but he chopped his heart in
half to stop it from beating.

This is insane!

How long can humans live when their
heart and breathing have stopped?

D-Damn it! It's not there!

I don't sense anything
else moving in that room!

D-Did he move somewhere else
using his zippers after all?

Y-You're reaching your limit!

Where the hell did he go?!

Don't tell me that Bucciarati

actually managed to finish off Prosciutto...

Once the aging stops, the rest of Bucciarati's
guys will step out of that turtle!

God damn it!

I'm not gonna let that happen!

W-We did it! He gave up on this cabin!

Your resolve made him search elsewhere!

You managed to make it through!

Hurry up and zip your body
back together! Hurry it up!

Un...believable...

How unlucky...

Bucciarati! Pull yourself together!

My only expertise is controlling bullets!

I don't have enough energy to move
stuff that's bigger than me!

He was more stubborn than I thought...

He's... won...

Stop, you damned train!

What the heck?!

B-Bro!

This was definitely a difficult path

that I wouldn't have been able
to traverse without some luck.

The path leading closer to you, that is.

You're going to pay, Bucciarati...

You got close to him!
Your resolve won out, Bucciarati!

...right in front of Bro,
before he's gone for good.

What the hell?!

I'm surprised you were able
to see through that attack!

His eyes and face...

They look as if they've come through
ten years of endless bloodshed.

I feel such intensity and
calmness from his eyes.

Trickery won't work against him.

Do it... Victory is in
your hands... Pesci...

Do it... I'm watching... over you...

I will murder you!

What?!

I knew you'd do that!

Going up someone's arm to get to
their heart was a surefire plan

I've been using because I was less confident
and I thought I'd miss otherwise!

When I'm confident I won't miss,
I go straight for the heart!

Right now, I'm going to go
straight for everything!

I'm gonna murder you!
I'll rip your heart out, Bucciarati!

You're supposed to say that
after you've actually done it.

In the world of gangsters, that is.

Did I... lose?

Am I... going to die?

But... I'm not... just going to die!

Go ahead... and take her... and run...

I'll let Trish live...

He's got the turtle!

Wh-Where am I?

But before I die...

I'll leave your heart in despair!

The despair of losing your crew!

I'm going to smash this turtle to pieces!

Holy shit! That's not good!

Earlier, I saw nobility and resolve that was
hardened like a diamond, shining in your eyes.

But you've fallen.

Now you're just a piece of shit.

Fallen? Fallen, you say?!

The only ones who are going to fall
and get crushed are these bastards!

You won't make it in time!
I hope you enjoy hell, Bucciarati!

You're going to fail, no matter what,
when you're a piece of shit.

Arrivederci.
"Goodbye"

Prosciutto –Dead
\h\hStand Name: The Thankful Death
Pesci –Dead
\h\hStand Name: Fisher Man

As I figured, we won't be able
to continue riding this train.

Yeah.

There's no way they haven't
contacted the rest of their crew.

I'm sure they told the others about
our destination and the turtle.

We'll have to use another form
of transportation from here.

There's something I want to ask you.

Are you willing to give me an answer?

I haven't been given permission
to answer any of your questions.

Our mission is solely to be your bodyguards.

You are going to answer me.

Who am I?

What the hell is this?

What's this on the ground?

Why can I suddenly see such bizarre things?

Why is my life in danger because
of a father I don't even know?!

As I thought...
The boss's daughter is a Stand user.

Answer me!

Bruno Bucciarati

Zipper Man

It's currently 6:34 PM.

I got here twenty minutes
after the train stopped.

Prosciutto is dead next to the tracks.

Parts of Pesci's body, which has been
torn to pieces, are on the riverbank.

Judging from the scene, the one who
disposed of them is Bucciarati's Zipper Man.

I see. Where are those guys and the girl?

They're long gone.

You gonna be able to track them, Melone?

Yeah.

Everything the two who have fallen managed
to do will make tracking them possible.

I've managed to collect a blood sample.

Bucciarati's, that is.

Episodio 17
BabyheadYou gonna be able to track them, Melone?

Yeah.

I've managed to collect a blood sample.

Bucciarati's, that is.

Hey, when's this train
gonna get underway?

Please, just wait a little bit longer.

We have another driver on the way right now!

What? What happened to the first one?

Ugh, talk about annoying.

Especially that crying brat over there.

I knew I shouldn't have gotten on
this train with all these peasants.

Miss.

How's your health?

H-Hey, what do you think you're doing?!

This is my compartment!

You can read what's written
on the door, can't you?

Do you have anything with
your birthdate written on it?

Uh...

Oh.

Hey! What the hell are you doing?!

Born March 10, 1977.
Twenty-four years old.

Very... bellissimo.

A very good age.

Don't touch my things!

Get out!

Smack

So good...

What a magnificent slap.

If you have the energy to produce
such a strong slap, there's no doubt.

You are...

in excellent health.

"Health: excellent."

And judging by the taste of your
fingers, your blood type is O.

Right?

What's your deal? Are you a thief?

Who do you think I am?

My family—

Ah, I don't need your name.

I don't care about where you
were born or your upbringing.

What's important is your
current health condition,

your birthday, and your blood type.

A Pisces and type O!

Bucciarati is an Aries and type A,

and, according to horoscopes,
is a terrible match for you.

And that's so perfect!

Looks like you drink and smoke, as well.

Do you do any drugs?

If you're doing any drugs...

You're even more amazingly di molto great!

I-If you want money, I have it...
If you want more, I have a credit card...

Listen.

Could you be quiet and listen?

This next question is the
most important of all.

What's important here is your preference.

Which do you prefer?

Apparently the Indian Karma Sutra,
which was written 1,500 years ago,

has more than 48 positions in it.

And I think it's really important...

as the beginning that leads to
the birth of an excellent child.

Now, choose.

Babyhead!

H-H-Help me!

Help me!

into something atrocious.

Di molto...

Episodio 17  Babyhead

As long as no one finds us,

we should make it to Venice
by tomorrow or the day after.

Man... Everyone seems super bummed.

I wonder if Bucciarati said
something harsh to Trish.

No... I think she's worried because
Bucciarati hasn't told her anything.

Trish is probably a Stand user,
but hasn't realized it.

And her mysterious father...

She has all sorts of questions on her mind.

But Bucciarati is forbidden to
speak about any of those things.

I'd like to look more into her abilities.

They'd probably offer some hints
about the mysterious boss.

She's very strong-willed.

She doesn't cry or complain at all.

Mista!

Tell Number Two and Number Three
to share the hamburger with us!

Huh? What are you talking about?

There's nothing to eat here right now...

Huh?

Where the hell did you get that?!

D-Don't tell me...

Why'd my hamburger disappear?

There's something under the seat.

Sh-Shit!

A turtle?

There's something on its back...

What are we going to do, Mista?
It looks like some kind of jewel... Is it a key?

This seems bad.

What just happened?

Mista, you were keeping watch
on the ceiling, weren't you?

What happened?

Huh? Me?

I-I haven't the slightest.
I wasn't watching at that moment...

Huh? Maybe the truck stopped...

Birth complete

Ow!

What happened?

Th-This...

D-Don't tell me I—

Thank goodness. Nothing happened.

That stupid asshole!

What the hell was up with
that creepy bastard?!

How dare he make me think
I was about to die?!

I wanna kill him, damn it!

That piece of shit!

Hello? Are you the conductor of this train?

Come to my compartment, right now!

What does "kill" mean?

Looks like they were born.

They're starting to learn from their mother.

Babyhead's child, that is...

And this is great!

They're already responding to their
mother's desire to kill someone!

Make us proud!

I'm telling you, some creepy bastard
attacked me here! He attacked me!

It's because you have that poor
excuse for a lock on the door!

There's even a bump on my head!

Ugh, I'm so pissed!

That piece of shit! I hope
you guys are prepared!

What does... "kill" mean?

I'm going to sue the hell out of
you guys! This is unbelievable!

What does... "piece of shit" mean?

Would you like to learn some more?

Okay, pay close attention.

This is Mr. Lion. He's the king of beasts.

The one with the long nose is Mr. Elephant,

and the one with the long
neck is Mr. Giraffe.

The one eating the grass is Mr. Zebra.

And...

Oh, what's this?

This is what "kill" means.
Do you understand?

It means to make them die,
or to get rid of them.

Next... Oh, we have some children's games.

A spinning top and baseball.

This is bowling, and these are ice skates.

Oh, dear! Look at how handy these things
are when you use them like this!

The ones who died are the pieces of shit.

You use "piece" when there's only one and
say "pieces" when there's more than one.

Do you understand?

But you can kill them in whatever
way your instincts tell you to.

However, you are forbidden
to attack this girl named Trish.

You need to capture her alive.

There is also a newbie
whose face we haven't seen yet.

They're with Bucciarati as well,
so you need to find them and kill them.

I have to pee.
What should I do?

What should you do?

I mean, just do it?

Babies pee all the time.

But it doesn't look like
the lock's been broken...

H-Hey, what is this?!

There's something leaking from
the ceiling of this stupid train!

I don't see anything...

I-It stinks!

What is this?! It's so dirty and gross!

Miss...

Mommy said that I stink.
She's also screaming that I'm "dirty and gross."

So it seems. And how does
that make you feel about her?

What a great mommy!

Yes!

Di molto! This is extremely wonderful!

You're learning so well!

I'm hungry...
What should I do?

Not yet. You haven't learned enough yet.

It's too soon.

Let me drink! Hurry and let me drink!

Hey, not yet! I told you, not yet!

I can't take this anymore!

I can't spend another second on this train!

I'll sue the train company and make sure
they take responsibility for all this!

I'll tell them the bump on my
head is a concussion, too...

Huh? I don't hear her anymore...

She was too good of a mother!

It's good that she taught him the desire
to kill first, but this is too early!

H-Hey!

Bucciarati's DNA is currently not moving...
It's idle somewhere up north.

What am I going to do with you?

I guess I can't deny your talents, though.

It looks like the automatic tracking
of Bucciarati's DNA has kicked in.

It's a hassle, but Babyhead's son is an
invincible, remote-controlled Stand.

Nothing can defeat you!

Melone

Babyhead

Let's just steal one already.

Are you stupid?

Word would spread in no time
and go right to the enemy.

Then they'll just be waiting to ambush us!

That's true.

Fugo's got a good point.

Then let's hear what
Bucciarati wants us to do.

Wh-What are you doing, Giorno?

If we steal only one,
we'll be caught immediately.

But if we steal a hundred...

If it isn't just a single
car that disappeared,

and if they're all found in
pieces at different locations,

the search for the missing
cars will be much harder,

and it should give us plenty
of time to get to Venice.

I see...

That definitely beats hitchhiking.

Whatever.

Giorno, you tell Bucciarati.

Here.

We're going to go get a car.

Please get down from the chair.

It's very dangerous outside right now.

Listen, Mr. Bucciarati.

If I were to ask you a dumb question,
would you be able to answer it?

It depends on the question.

What am I supposed to do if
I need to go to the bathroom?

You aren't suggesting that
I use a diaper, are you?

I see... That's a very good question.

Good. I'm glad you understand.

Let's make the closet a toilet.

Please, go ahead.

Go ahead?

You said you had to go to the bathroom.

I don't know where it leads underneath that,
but I'm sure the turtle will be fine.

It might actually get nutrients from it.

I have no idea what you're trying to say...

Bucciarati, we've procured a car.

All right. Once we confirm
that we're safe, let's head out.

Understood.

That bike... When did it show up here?

Where's the person who was riding it?

Giorno, is something wrong?

Trish?

What the hell?!

Trish!

I-Impossible!

Trish!

Zipper—

Shit... It's a Stand, and
a remote-controlled one!

But this power isn't remote-controlled. What's—

Bucciarati, please be on your guard.

A strange bike has appeared.

Bucciarati?

Don't tell me... Bucciarati!

Where's Trish? Trish!

I had the turtle in my
hands this whole time...

I'd know if they came outside.

Could the enemy have already
used some kind of attack?

Golden Wind!

Di molto!

I've captured the boss's daughter, Trish,
and Bucciarati as well.
What should I do now?

Di molto! Well done, Babyhead!

Get away from there immediately, of course!

I'm currently inside a turtle...
There's one human waiting at the exit of the turtle.

I've never seen him before.
He's going to find me on my way back. What should I do?

Someone you've never seen?

That must be the newbie.

If he finds you, you're going
to have to get rid of him.

Roger.
I will get rid of the newbie who's waiting at the turtle's exit.

But make sure you do it quietly
so you aren't found by the others.

Capturing Trish takes top priority.

I'll have them head over
there as well, just in case.

I thought I felt a presence there, but...

No, you were correct.

Everyone! There's an enemy here!
We're being atta—

D-Did it take... my throat?!

Are you done yet, Mista?

Don't rush me!

Is something wrong?

Nah. Giorno's waving.

I'm pretty sure Bucciarati's telling
us to hurry up and get the car.

I just told you not to rush me!

The attack was successful. It's very quiet,
because I stole part of his throat.

Di molto! Well done!

Impossible! I destroyed the cabinet,
but it's still not showing itself?

And how am I not able to see
it the moment it attacks me?

Where is it hiding, and how is
it carving out pieces of me?

Carving out pieces... Which means...

Shpang

So you've carved away his leg and eye, too?

Di molto! Well done!
Now, come back, Babyhead!

The attack was unsuccessful.
Obviously, he's figured out what I am. What should I do?

What?

The newbie outside has removed the key from the turtle's back.

Apparently, when someone removes the key, only living things can leave.

My body is floating upward.
What should I do?

I'm not sure what you're
saying... Living things?

You're a Stand! It doesn't matter
if you're living or not.

That's true, but right now,
I have the eye that I stole from him.
His eye is living.

I knew it... It was that cabinet.

I see now...

It's not that I couldn't see the enemy.

I'd seen them all along!

This ability chops up humans and
reconstructs them into something else!

Melone.
What should I do?
What should I do?
What should I do?

Don't panic! Who cares if he
figured out your ability?

The newbie hasn't been able to breathe for
a while, and he's missing a leg, right?

Just defeat him already and steal
the turtle, along with Trish!

Roger.

Golden Wind!

It's dodging by splitting itself apart!

Which means...

G-Guys...

I need to somehow... let them know...

That had some effect!

No, that was just a rock.

Sh-Shit...

Trish is going to get taken...

At this rate, Bucciarati will be eliminated!

I-It's strong...

Is it... invincible?

I will leave the newbie's corpse here.

As planned, I've quietly captured Trish.

Di molto! Good!

I'm heading back to the train
you're on now, Melone.

Reconstructing humans into objects...

Your ability gave me an excellent hint.

Your ability is similar to my Golden Wind.

They're very much alike in the way
that they both recreate something.

Due to the hint you gave me,
and almost being killed,

it would appear...

that I've grown a little.

M-Melone, did you hear that?

I totally forgot earlier, but now
I know the newbie's Stand ability.

What about the newbie?

His button has become an eye!
In his hand! It became an eyeball!

Hey, Babyhead, what are you talking about?

What's this about the dead newbie?

He inserted the eye into his face!
Rumble

He did the same with his throat and leg!

His ability is to create life!

He created his own parts!

His ability is the exact opposite of mine!

Hey, who the hell are you talking about?

You're not getting away! Golden Wind!

The newbie... He...

He's been revived!

A-Are you listening, Melone?

He made parts of the motorcycle into roots!

I can't separate them!

I have to get rid of the
parts that are stuck!

I need to get away from the bike!

Did it turn into a rock again?

This isn't good. He's going
to try to pick up the turtle.

I'll kill him before he picks it up!

Calm down, Babyhead!

Let him pick up the turtle.

What do you mean?

The moment he picks up the turtle,
tear him apart for good.

Oil's pouring out. That's not good!

Make sure he can never get up again!

I got him!

It was only a little bit, but how
dare you freak me out, you bastard?!

Now, I'm going to rip your head—

I've learned a lot from your ability
to turn humans into objects.

I'm not sure if it's fate or if our
Stands were attracted to each other

due to their similarities that we met.

But because of you,
my Golden Wind was able to grow.

Wh-Where did it go?

I just tore off your wrist. Where did it go?

Tore off?

That's incorrect.

I intentionally let it go.

I'd like to give you a little advice.

You should probably use your hand to
defend yourself, rather than attack me.

D-Don't you dare underestimate me!

Take this!

What?!

The hand that I cut off has already
become another living creature

and invaded your body.

Yes.

As you can see, it turned into a piranha!

Episodio 18
Head to Venice!I should be able to meet up
with Melone in about an hour.

Ghiaccio, I'll leave the
situation to you and Melone.

You can never be too careful.

I'll stay here and try to figure
out where they're headed.

Got it, Risotto.

How much longer are you going
to make me wait? Hurry up.

You should have no problem restoring this.

Risotto.

Do you really think you can get
away with betraying Passione?

We're a bit short on time.

Next will be your left eye.

As long as you have your right hand
and right eye, you can still work.

You should know better than anyone!

Anyone who betrays the boss will be erased...

Episodio 18  Head to Venice!

What?!

The hand that I cut off has already
become another living creature

and invaded your body.

As you can see, it turned into a piranha!

There's a huge hole that goes
all the way to its head...

and it can still move?

Wh-What's wrong, Babyhead?

Answer me! Hey!

This is turtle shit...

This is literally shit that
the turtle left behind!

Why the hell do I have to go through this?

Damn it!

This pain in my heart...

You're going to make up for this

by dying in disgrace! I'll see to that!

If Bucciarati and Trish won't turn back
to normal unless I destroy you...

then I'll do it!

You're not getting away.
Next, I'll go for your head!

Go ahead and try it...

you dickhead!

Dickhead
I'll kill you...
Go ahead and try it...

Damn it...

The only problem with auto-tracking is
that it won't listen to me 100 percent.

You bastard!

You got me three times already.

I know the range of your attacks!

That bastard's range...

just grew!

It's gotten taller?

It must've grown even more
because it got pissed off!

Di molto!

I knew choosing that woman as the
mother was the right choice!

Simple is best.

I'm going to kill this bastard
exactly how I want to kill him!

Bring it back, Golden Wind!

Die!

Useless!

A direct hit.

You should get your eyes checked.

You didn't hit my head!

I've won! This is the end!

I told you, it's useless.

Wh-What the hell?!

Look again.

The hand that Golden Wind
brought back wasn't its own.

It's the bike.

I gave the bike life and had
it return to us as a hand.

Crush

You just took that bike into your body,

as a part of you.

This is nothing...

I'll just split apart and get away aga—

Think about it.

There's gasoline in bikes.

I'm pretty sure I can cause a big enough
explosion to keep you from splitting apart

in time to escape.

What?!

Kabooom

Sizzling... Burning...

Looks like doing what you
wanted was useless...

in the end.

Burn burn burn burn burn burn burn...ing...!

I-It disappeared?

My contact with it disappeared?!

Damn it! This is unbelievable!

Curse you, newbie!

He did it.

It should be somewhere around here...

My car is gone!

Where's my car? Was it stolen?!

That's Melone's bike...

I was told to leave no stone unturned and

take a leaf out of someone's book if
I have to, in order to find them...

I get the "leave no stone unturned" part.

I totally get it.

I mean, you have to turn
stones over to find stuff.

But what the hell does it mean to
take a leaf out of someone's book?!

What's a leaf doing inside a book?!

Damn it!

What's that supposed to mean?!

Why the hell is there a leaf in a book?!

You think I'm stupid?! Damn it!

Hey, Melone! Bucciarati and his
crew are nowhere to be found!

Are you listening?! Hello?!

I hear you...

But I haven't completely failed just yet!

I still have Bucciarati's blood!

I can create an infinite number of Juniors!

I'll have them track Bucciarati
down immediately!

You'd better, Melone.

We need to be extra careful with the newbie.

We should get rid of him first.

I'll find an even better mother

and create an even more
powerful and invincible

Junior to go track them down.

What the hell was that?

It looked like a snake...

What? What's wrong?

What's a snake doing at a station in Rome?

I-It's burning!

This is... that newbie's ability...

He must've used Junior's corpse to—

Hello?

Hey, Melone! What's wrong? Hey!

The venomous snake I left
at Roma Termini Station

reverted to being one of
the enemy's components.

We disposed of the user.

That makes five.

If the information we have is correct,

there are only two members
of the Hitman Team left.

Still, we can't let our guard down.

Let's haul ass to Venice!

Now Melone, too?

Shit! Shit! Shit!

Shit!

Hello?!

It's me. I've managed to
get that thing analyzed.

Huh?!

I'm sending the data right now.

We've received a new order from the boss.

Abbacchio, could you come
over here by this chair?

Me?

Here's the order.

"Have Abbacchio use his Moody Jazz
near the chair and rewind 14 hours."

Someone was inside this turtle
before we got here.

I think that's what this suggests.

Got it.

Then I'll search from around 15 hours back.

It transformed.

Hey, I've seen that geezer before!

That's the capo, Mr. Pericolo.

So he was the one who placed the turtle

next to the water fountain at Naples Station.

And approximately 14 hours
ago, he entered this turtle.

I'm continuing the replay.

Bucciarati and team, I will now
give you your final order.

Final order?

The reason we're using this method to give
you information is to prevent leaks.

I'm about to tell you something of utmost
importance that no one else must learn:

how you're going to hand
Trish over to the boss.

How we're going to...

...hand Trish over?

Well, here it is.

Once you safely get to Venice,

go to this sculpture and retrieve
the OA-DISC that's inside.

It contains the data on how
you're going to hand her over.

Hey! He set it on fire!

Abbacchio, pause it!

Right.

I'm pretty sure this is the
entrance to Venice...

Right in front of Santa Lucia Station.

The lion statue is from there.

That is all.

Make sure that you obtain the OA-DISC.

They've already found out about me.

The most important thing is to
deliver Trish safely to her father.

We mustn't leave any kind of evidence.

Thanks to the boss, I was able to live a
very wealthy, blessed, and fulfilling life.

My mission is now over.

I pray from the bottom of
my heart that you stay safe.

What the hell?!

Mr. Pericolo...

They should've received the order by now.

Obtain the disc, or getting to me
is going to prove rather difficult.

The most important thing is
what awaits at the end...

Bring my daughter Trish here...

to Venice.

The marine fortress city on the water,
visible in the morning haze: Venice.

There is only one road by which one can
travel there from the mainland by car:

the Ponte della Libertà, which stretches for a
length of 3.5 kilometers over a shallow ocean.

The station lies just beyond the bridge.

The lion statue where the disc is
hidden can be found in a square there.

Giorno, there's no one tailing us so far.

Yes. There's no one coming
from the front, either.

The city is still asleep.

We're the only car on this road.

Why do the windows keep
fogging up so quickly?

Ow!

What the hell?!

I apologize.

The tires just slipped a bit.

On a straight bridge like this?

Be more careful, damn it!
Do you even have a license?

No. I'm only fifteen.

What's that thing stuck on the window?

It's on the inside.

I didn't notice it when
I was looking outside...

No, wait...

That shape...

It's a finger!

Let's open the windows a bit.

It's morning, so the different temperatures
inside and outside the car are fogging them up.

Wh-What?! What's with this wind?

At first, we were scared frozen... But...

With the help of a computer,
it wasn't too hard to recreate

the ashes that were lying next
to Pericolo in the photo.

You guys are naïve!

There's no way you can get
away from the Hitman Team!

An enemy?! They somehow got
onto the roof of the car!

Mista, what are you doing?! Shoot the roof!

This car is being frozen
at an insane speed.

It's so cold that my finger
got stuck to the window

and broke off before I even felt the cold.

If I don't peel my face off of it,
my brain's gonna freeze up.

But I'm not sure if I want to
sacrifice my face, either...

Where's the turtle?

I don't see the turtle inside the car.

You two aren't with Trish and Bucciarati?

If you're actually bothering to split up...

I got it!

That means you must be on a mission
to get something extremely important.

The location in the picture...

There must be something
at the station in Venice!

Blood finally spurted from my hand!

Yeehaw!

Bonk

I-Ice!

The guy's encased himself in ice and
froze himself to the roof of the car!

The bullets can't get through to him!

What's wrong?

C-Crap! We're starting to freeze, too!

Save me!

Number Two!

Don't go!

Number Two! Number Three!

Fwooooo

What?!

A-All I did was blink... and now
my eyelashes are stuck together!

He must've waited for this to happen
before getting on the roof...

This car is currently going
80 kilometers per hour.

Which means...

It's the same as being stuck in wind
blowing at 20 meters per second.

The effective temperature drops by 1° Celsius
for every meter of wind velocity,

so we're currently freezing at -20° Celsius.

Then stop the damn car!

Why the hell are you still flooring it?!

Yes. I've been trying to stop it.

But the brake pedal is
frozen and won't go down!

I'm losing the steering wheel, too.

The engine's running and doesn't
seem like it's going to stop.

The surface of the car has
reached -100° Celsius for sure!

And at incredible speed!
So this is... the enemy's ability!

Th-The blood that was spurting
out of my hand froze...

The moisture from my breathing caused
my nostrils to freeze together...

And now, my lips...

Shit! I can't breathe!

S-Stop the car, Giorno!

You can turn the car into a
frog or something, can't you?!

Do something with your ability!

I've already tried that, as well.

But there are no organisms that
can be born at -100° Celsius!

You know Paris, France?
In English, they pronounce it "Paris,"

but everyone else pronounces it
without the "s" sound, like the French do.

But with Venezia, everyone pronounces
it the English way, "Venice."

Like The Merchant of Venice
and Death in Venice...

Why, though?!
Why isn't the title Death in Venezia?!

Smack Smack Smack

Are you friggin' mocking me?!

It takes place in Italy, so use
the Italian word, damn it!

That shit pisses me off!

Bunch of dumbasses!

Looks like it's finally becoming
a bit difficult to drive.

Mista...

My Golden Wind needs heat.

So sadly, all I'm really
useful for right now...

is picking up bullets.

You won't be able to fill
the car with any more holes.

I'll just freeze you to an even lower tem—

When you fire bullets,
they heat up, don't they?

So when I fire the bullets that
Giorno picked up for me...

It creates heat!

I guess I'll go ahead and shout
this for Giorno, while I'm at it...

Golden Wind!

We did it!

Plant roots have the energy to prop up
asphalt in roads and even shatter rocks!

Keep hold of the steering wheel, Giorno!

We're gonna get the hell outta here!

Shink

Tch.

So that must be the ability of the
newbie Melone was talking about.

But you're not getting away!

Seriously? That bastard!

He's still coming after us!

I'm gonna be the one who gets his hands on
whatever's at the station, no matter what.

You're wasting your bullets.

My ability, White Ice, freezes the moisture
in the air to an extremely low temperature,

which I then wear like armor.

This also allows me to skate,

but I'm also wrapped in something so
strong that even bullets can't pierce it!

Go faster, Giorno!

I can't go any faster!

The tires are still slipping.

Even worse, they found
out about the station!

They haven't found out about
the turtle where Trish is,

so depending on how you look at it,
that's kind of a bright side.

You're always so optimistic, aren't you?

You're very unusual.

He's coming! Floor it! Faster!

I told you, I can't!

If we slip, we're going
to lose even more spee—

Just do it, damn it!
I said floor it, so floor it!

I told you! This is useless!

Number Three and Number Two
up on the roof, come back!

I hope you get to share a hot,
passionate kiss with the road.

Your face will be well-acquainted
with it at the speed you're going.

Yeah!

Good. We managed to lose him.

Now get us into the city and
head straight for the station!

Before he can catch up to us, we're going
to get our hands on the thing and hide!

Giorno!

You're not getting away!

There's no way you guys are
going to make it to the station!

He's freezing the moisture
from the car's exhaust!

What kind of temperature do you
have to freeze it at to do this shit?

You bastard! Eat lead again!

He opened the trunk! Which means...

Sh-Shit! He got into the trunk!
Stop the car, Giorno!

He's gonna freeze the brake pedal
so it'll be useless again!

There's no need for that...

Gunslinger Mista.

Seeing as Trish isn't here, this is what
I was planning to do in the first place.

Shatter—

G-Giorno!

It only cracked?

Is he invincible?

How can I destroy this armor?

Giorno! Get away from him!

No! Not yet!

We made it to Venice!

I'm diving into the canal!

Episodio 19
White IceWe made it to Venice!

I'm diving into the canal!

Mista! Please hurry up
and get out of the car!

G-Giorno! You... Your body's already...

I'm sure you already know this, Mista,

but our priority is to obtain the item.

Getting that thing will lead to our victory.

The disc is in there!

We're surrounded by water, so it'll
take a while for it to freeze.

That's why I drove into the canal.

Don't worry about me! Hurry and get out!

Got it, Giorno. But I don't
like your idea of victory!

Killing him, and the both of us
living to retrieve that thing...

That'll be our victory!

Like hell I'm gonna let you get away!

Just try and jump in, Mista!

I don't mind making a wager on whether
or not you can swim faster than my ice!

Sh-Shit! Driving into the
canal was a bad idea!

This guy has no weak point
when it comes to ice!

Episodio 19  White Ice

Turn the car into a plant, Giorno!

The hood of the car hasn't
completely frozen over yet.

Nurture a plant to life while you still can!

You're trying to grow vines
to use them as ropes?

That's not happening!

I-It's no use.

We need the right temperature
to grow a plant like a vine

that'll grow fast enough to reach the bank.

In this low temperature,

the only plant that'll grow is the
short grass you'd find in a tundra!

Who said anything about growing
vines that reach the bank, Giorno?

This is perfectly fine!

Short grass is exactly what I want!

But I need more! More! More!

If you don't want to die, get me more!

If you don't grow more,
we're gonna die, Giorno!

Gotcha! Too bad you couldn't
grow it to the bank of the canal!

Well done, Giorno! It froze over!

Now you won't die!

Th-That bastard! He froze some
short grass to create a sled?

N-No... A snowboard!

Damn it!

He's not going to let me get away so easily.

Of course not...

White Ice! Undo the ice temporarily!

Th-Th ice...

...melted!

Mista!

An extremely low temperature
is a world of life or death!

Nothing can move in extremely
low temperatures!

They can stop everything!

That's what makes my White Ice perfect!

It can even stop the raging
ocean if I want it to!

Hurry and get up on the bank, Mista!

Mista!

Gather up the grass that's
floating in the water!

The grass you were using as a snowboard!

While you can fire the
gun in your right hand!

Give it up, Mista!

Do you still not understand that
attacking me is pointless?!

Stab

Gathering up grass... I see.

Giorno, if you release your ability,
the short grass turns back into car parts.

Therefore, we can shoot them into you!

What?!

D-Did that do it?

No, it's shallow.

I think we can at least get away for now,

but Mista, this just bought us some time!

Let's get the thing quickly,
then get out of here fast.

That same strategy won't work again
the next time he catches up.

Please go, Mista!

The disc will show up somewhere
if we destroy the lion statue.

I'll retrieve it,
then hide somewhere in the city.

If I have a few dozen
seconds, I can do this.

But will hiding be enough
to get away from that guy?

It might just work, but it might not.

More importantly,
this guy's way too dangerous.

It'll be even worse if he ends up
running into Bucciarati and the others.

We need to end him now!

This is our only chance!

Wha— Mista! What are you doing?!

Your ability is perfect? That's impossible!

If you've completely encased yourself
in ice, how are you able to breathe?

There it is. I knew it.

Air's leaking out.

He's breathing from there,
the back of his neck.

Take your positions, Six Bullets!

Number One and Number Two,
go around and flank him!

Wah, he's looking over here!

He's gonna do another ice attack!

No, first, he's probably going to go up for air.

Once he rises to the surface,
I'm gonna put a bullet in his head!

He's trying to go up to the surface!

Let's go, Bullets!

We're aiming for the moment
he takes a breath of air!

Mista!

Number One and Two are saying
they can't see the hole!

It must be due to his posture!
He's facing up right now!

The hole's hidden!

Sh-Shit! Let's scram!

Oh, shut up!

Stay in your positions,
Number One and Number Two!

How dare you do that to my forehead?!

Mista!

What the?!

You shot some fish that were swimming around?

What the hell are you trying to do?!

He looked down! We can see it!

It's the hole! Now!

Here it comes!

We can do this!

Gwooom

We did it! Bullseye!

Th-That sound...

That sound... It can't be!

So you found my breathing
hole and went after that...

Mista!

But extremely low
temperatures stop everything!

Gases turn to liquids, and liquids turn to solids!

Take a closer look.
Can't you see the air that's stopped?

The bullet, Mista!

That's the sound of a ricocheting bullet!

What?!

White Ice... Gently Weeps!

Mista!

I'd already created a wall of frozen air!

It uses up quite a bit of my Stand's power,

but now nothing can shoot a bolt into me!

Anything that comes near me will stop!

This is a lesson I learned from you, Mista!

Giorno was right.

This is all my fault...
This is my responsibility.

If only I'd prioritized getting that thing...

It's not under any trash cans or benches.

I can't find anything of importance,

and they wouldn't hide it
out in the open, anyway.

But considering how much Mista is hurrying,

I just realized it must
be in the immediate area.

Where is it? This photo should be a hint...

Shit. This is the worst possible scenario.

Mista's currently acting out of despair.

He's decided to take responsibility for
this, even if it costs him his life.

But the only ones who can open up a path

in the darkness are those with resolve.

Things are getting interesting.

We're going to have to
make some sacrifices,

but my resolve, as well as Mista's,

will open up a path in the darkness!

Ghiaccio

White Ice

What the hell is this?

It was embedded in there?

In one of the cuts or gaps in the statue?

Damn it! If I'm close enough,

I should be able to shoot into
the hole in his neck again!

If I can just get close enough
to aim through the wall of air...

Mista's getting reckless.

He's willing to take responsibility
for this at the cost of his own life.

But this isn't just determination
resulting from him being cornered.

It's resolve!

We need resolve right now!

Resolve doesn't mean sacrifice!

A computer disc!

I knew it! The thing you were trying
to get was something to tell you

how to get to the boss!

I did it! Now we can find
out who the boss really is!

All that's left now... is Trish!

Right after I finish you bastards off!

Come at me with all your futile attempts!

Let me finish you off!

Mista!

What the hell are you doing?!

Having resolve is the
ability to open up a path

we need to follow within the darkness!

Guido Mista: arrested at 17 for murder.

The result of the trial:

they did not see his
actions as self-defense,

and he was sentenced to
15 to 30 years in prison.

My happy-go-lucky youth...

Is this really my fate?

Mista always had an optimistic view of life,

but in this moment,
he didn't know what to do.

Damn it.

Get up. You're being released.

You're the one who bailed me out?

Yes. I saw the incident on the news and
decided you acted out of self-defense.

It means you are incredibly skilled
with a pistol and full of life.

But a guy like you probably
wouldn't last two years in prison.

That's why...

You pulled some strings.

Do you belong to some organization?

Come with me.

There's an excellent ristorante nearby.

I like the way you eat.

The bruschetta here is great, too.
Do you still have some room?

Yeah.

Pardon me.

Yes, sir?

Could I get some bruschetta for him...
I should get some for them, too.

Could I get four orders of bruschetta?

No, make that five.
I guess I'll get an order for myself.

Right away, sir.

So, continuing our conversation...

I'm in.

I think you and I will get along great.

So, I'm in.

On one condition, though.

Treat me to some dolce, too.

Does this place have strawberry cake?

You sure are an odd one.

I guess this must be fate, too.

This isn't so bad.
Everything worked out in the end.

Mista learned that people have
predetermined destinies.

When they're young,

people may find themselves at a standstill
or taking the long way around at times,

but they ultimately end up traveling
the path they were destined to walk.

I can see it! I can see the path perfectly!

I can see it for sure this time!

It's there, Giorno!

I see the path I need to
take through the darkness!

Yeehaw!

Batoom
Bam
Bam
Shank
Crack
Crack

You guys don't seem to understand.

The air is frozen because of the
extremely low temperature.

Just like this.

If I put air that's been frozen
solid in my suit and melt it,

the air turns back to normal!

If I take it in like this...

Just like a diver who has
an air tank on their back,

I don't need a breathing hole anymore!

The hole!

He deflected the bullets!

Six of them! O-Oh, no!

I hope you have the resolve for this, Mista!

It's over.

Yeah, my resolve is there, Giorno.

If you hadn't given me your resolve,

I wouldn't have been able to see this path.

The path toward the resolve to be
willingly shot by my own bullets...

I-I can't see!

The blood's frozen to me and hardened...

The path through the darkness

isn't the path for the bullets to
get through your wall of ice.

I-It was to splash your face with my blood!

Shit! I can't get it off!

Hey, the metal pole from earlier!

Mista, your bullet carved it into a—

Ow! That hurts!

Something... Something... Something...
Something lukewarm is—

You asked me if I had the resolve for this...

Well, let me show you!

But you'll have to show
me some resolve, too.

The resolve to be filled with holes
and depart for the next world!

Th-That bastard's still standing!

He's hell-bent on shoving
me back even farther!

Is he insane?! He's determined to finish this!

Shit! I need to get this out of my neck!

You're crazy! The bullet's
gonna come flying back!

You're not gonna last!

I have to make it through.

Starting now, I'm showing my true resolve!

Steel yourselves, Bullets!

White Ice... Gently Weeps!

Y-You can't take any more, Mista!

You're going to lose consciousness!

We're also...

...going to disappear!

N-Not yet!

I'm still conscious! I can still shoot him!

Y-You did it!

It went all the way in!

You're... wrong...

The one with stronger resolve... is me...

Guido Mista...

I'll commend you for... pushing me this far...

But the one who took better advantage
of all the spurting blood... was me!

I froze the blood that spurted
out of my neck to support me!

Now my neck won't get
pushed farther onto the spike!

I'm totally secured!

The spike won't go any farther in!

Also... Haven't you forgotten something?

The bullet you shot last is still...

Straight into your head!

I win!

There's no wound?!

Wha—

Mista...

Your resolve is shining upon the path,

even brighter than this rising sun.

And it's shining on the path...

that we're meant to take!

What the hell?!

Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless!

Recently, I... started noticing...

that despite Giorno Giovanna...

being a newbie...

things always seem...

to play out exactly how he says.

The resolve I showed just now
was also partly Giorno's.

It was making its way into my
heart before I even realized it.

It almost feels like he's my capo,
even more so than Bucciarati,

and he kept me moving.

What the hell is his deal?

Well, I guess that doesn't matter right now.

It's not my style to think
too much about stuff.

Mista, we safely retrieved
the disc, thanks to you.

Hurry and fix me up. I-I can't breathe...

I wouldn't have been able to show
that resolve without your ability.

Hurry and fix me up, before I actually die...

Of course. But I'd like to
clear something up first.

Golden Wind doesn't exactly fix things.

It creates parts of your body.

I'll give life to the bullets
embedded in your body

and plug up the arteries and
other parts that were destroyed.

Just shut up and do it already.

Since I'm not exactly healing you,
your pain will remain.

Please don't complain to me later.

Ow!

O-Ow! Be more gentle!
Be more gentle, damn it, Giorno!

I told you, I can't.

You're a gangster, for crying out loud.
Please quit fussing.

There are about 18 more wounds,

so you'll have to remove some of
your clothes for me to plug the rest.

Bucciarati! I'm picking up two signals...

It doesn't look like there's anyone else.

Proceed, but carefully.

I'm assuming it's Mista and Giorno.

I'm sure they're bored out of their minds
waiting for us since nothing's happening.

Ack! Giorno!

There they are! Hey, Mista! Gio—

Be gentler! Gentler, damn it!

Don't take off my clothes!
I'll feel it more!

Well, Narancia? Did you find those two?

Huh? W-Well, u-um...

No! Huh?! Suddenly there's
something in my eye?

Giorno, no! Don't! N-No more! I-I can't!

I can't see! I can't see them clearly!

Be gentler, damn it!

Risotto's whereabouts are unknown.
Currently searching airports, train stations,
and the area around Naples.

Curse you, Risotto...

You must be heading to Venice.

If Bucciarati and his crew put
an end to you, that's fine.

Regardless, I'm not worried.

Episodio 20
The Final Mission from the BossEpisodio 20 The Final Mission from the Boss

How much longer till we get there?

We're almost at Rialto Bridge.

It'll be at least another five minutes.

All right. Keep going.

Bucciarati, what was the
mission from the boss?

I'm reconfirming the mission
from the boss right now.

Are you all safe?
I thank you for protecting my daughter
Trish from the bottom of my heart.

I'll read it aloud.

"The information on this disc

was inputted the moment all of you
boarded the train at Naples.

Therefore, I'd like to warn you
that I have no way of knowing

how many more are after you,

or how many members you've
lost at this point in time.

The information on this disc is the
safest way for me to meet my daughter,

and also your final mission.

Let me also warn you that,
should you deviate even in the slightest

from the instructions on this disc,
it will be unforgivable.

If any of you do anything other
than what's instructed of you,

even if it's accidental,

I will consider it a warning
that you mean to harm me.

Here is your final mission.

You will now head to

the island of San Giorgio Maggiore.

The place you will take my daughter is

the top of the great bell
tower of the church there.

Once you take my daughter there,

your mission will be over.

Instruction one: there are no
stairs to the top of the tower.

Currently, there is only one
elevator that goes to the top.

The only ones allowed in the elevator
are Trish and one bodyguard.

Instruction two: the bodyguard is prohibited

from carrying any knives, guns,
cell phones, or anything else.

Instruction three: you must
land on the island within

fifteen minutes of retrieving this disc.

There is a tracking device in the
disc, so I know where you are.

Instruction four: the rest
of you will wait on the boat.

You are not allowed on the island."

That's all of it.

Bucciarati, we have arrived.

So the boss is at the top
of that tower right now...

Those are pretty detailed instructions.
He seems extremely cautious.

But I guess you couldn't
be a mafia boss otherwise.

Anyway, this means our mission ends here.

We all made it out alive,
so I guess all's well that ends well.

Yeah, just barely, though.

Let's live it up in Venice for a
few days before we go home.

I hear the food's great there.

They have good food here?

I just remembered I was hungry.

What kind of food do they have?

Well, they have squid ink pasta,
horsehair crab salad,

and I hear the carpaccio at the
Hotel Cipriani is fantastic.

Hey, you bastards!

Don't let your guard down!

The mission's not over yet!

Narancia, keep an eye on the radar.

S-Sure.

Bucciarati,

I volunteer to be her
bodyguard in the tower.

I'll take her to the top of the bell tower.

Who the hell do you think you are?!

Bucciarati's the capo, so of course
he's going to take her, you dumbass!

The boss didn't specify anyone because
he didn't know who was still alive!

Of course. I'll go.

All right, Trish.

The two of us will go onto the island,
as we were ordered.

I know.

It's our chance to find out
who the boss really is.

I'll find him, no matter what.

Oh, I know. Giorno,

could you give me that charm to wish
me good luck on this final mission?

Ladybugs are considered sun bugs.

They're symbols of life, right?

They're good luck charms, right?

Oh, that's right.

Yes. Ladybugs bring good luck.

This brooch that's been given life with Golden
Wind's ability will act as a tracking device.

Bucciarati.

What is it, Fugo?

I thought this was a good
opportunity to say this.

Why so formal? What is it?

I knew that you'd become capo someday,

and I know you'll be able
to complete this mission.

Of course he can.

Let's aim for an even higher
position in the organization!

Yeah... You're right.

Let's go, Trish.

If I can somehow get this
onto the boss's body,

Giorno will be able to track him down.

Right now, we just need
to find out who he is...

No matter what.

The elevator door is open.

There are only two buttons,
for the first floor and the roof.

It goes directly to either.
There are no other floors to stop on.

What's...

What's going to happen to me?

I suddenly got kidnapped by
gangsters just like you guys,

had my life threatened,

and now, I'm going to be taken to
a father I don't even know or love...

Where am I going to go now?

The boss is just concerned for your safety.

As for what will happen to you from now on,

this is what I think...

First, you'll be given a different name.

You might even need to have plastic surgery.

You'll be given a new identification
and family registry.

You'll be somewhere we won't know of,

some far-off country, where you'll live happily.

Your father has that kind of power.

Here. Let me give you a hand.

It's not like...

I-I'm nervous or anything...

I wonder...

if I'll be able to like my father.

No family worries about that.

Yeah...

You're right.

It's strange to even worry about that.

We're almost to the top.

Trish? Tri—

Wh-What?!

Trish... No... What's—

Trish and I should be the only ones here.

No one other than the guys
on my team knows we're...

No... It can't be!

Could the boss...

In order to make sure he stays
completely invisible...

Did he have us protect his daughter

in order to ensure that he could
finish off his daughter himself?!

Bruno Bucciarati was born as a
fisherman's son in a suburb of Naples.

His father wasn't the best
at dealing with people,

but he was an earnest and honest fisherman

who tried to protect his family
from the cruelties of this world.

Bruno.

Dad.

You need me to fix the net?

Got it.

His mother was very kind, and Bruno
loved his conversations with her.

He always looked forward to the bedtime
stories she read to him before going to sleep.

All right, go to sleep, now.

But...

It occurred when Bucciarati was seven.

So what are you going to do now?

Well... I want a change,
so I'm going to leave this town.

After ten years of marriage,
his parents divorced.

As for the reason, only his parents
would know the answer to that.

What are we going to do about Bruno?

After a discussion, Bruno's parents
had him make a decision.

Bruno, your father and I both love you,

but we're going to be living separately now.

Who do you want to live with?
Me or your father?

We want you to decide.

You want to leave this place with
me and go to the city, right?

You're very smart.

You want to go to a good school, don't you?

There'll be a lot more kids your age, too!

So, you want to live with
your mother, right?

You'll come with me, right?

I'll...

live with Dad.

Huh?!

What?! Bruno, you should
really think about this!

You like me better, don't you?

I'll stay here with Dad.

No...

Mom's strong...

She should be able to make it anywhere.

But...

All right, I'm leaving.

I'll come back once a month to visit.

Okay.

As Bucciarati had instinctively figured,

two years after his mother left,
she remarried a man from Milan.

He would end up only seeing his
mother at Christmas after that.

As for his father, because his
wife left him for the city,

he became determined to send
Bucciarati to a good school.

Dad, I think customers are
going to come by soon.

Oh, I guess it's about that time...

I'll reapply the nets.

All right. I'll let you handle this.

Up until then, he'd only been a fisherman,

but in order to earn money
for his son's tuition,

he started taking tourists and
other fishermen on his boat.

And the wheel of fate continued to turn.

Sirs, that island isn't good for fishing.

There are better—

Whatever, man.

We wanna go fishing over there.

Just shut up and take us.

Got it?

R-Right...

That evening, Bucciarati's father would
be rescued by the Coast Guard,

his body riddled with bullet holes.

He's been shot seven times in his arms,
shoulders, chest, and torso.

We got an operating room open!

Dad! Dad!

There are bullets still in his body.

Dad!

For now, please just wait
until the surgery's finished.

Be strong. Can you give us contact
information for the rest of your family?

Dad...

Forensics is coming by later,
so give them this as evidence.

Yes, sir.

Thanks.

Right.

H-How did this happen?

Good evening. Are you his son?

We found this at the scene.

Apparently, your father
witnessed a drug deal.

He was shot so that he wouldn't talk.

Your father is a very important witness.

We don't exactly want him to die, either.

I'm sure he'll be okay.
My father was shot because
of something like that?

Luckily, Bucciarati's father survived.

Despite being shot seven times,
none of the wounds were fatal,

and the boat that found
and rescued him

happened to have supplies
to treat his wounds,

allowing him to survive
until he got to the hospital.

He was graced by good luck all around.

But in terms of Bucciarati's life,
it might've been better if his father had died.

There are certain sticky
situations where you don't

have the opportunity to
choose the right path.

Fishermen have way too
much energy, damn it.

I'll keep watch! Just hurry up and do it!

You've got some nerve,
making us come here so late at night.

Go to hell already!

Wh-Who the hell are you?

A k-kid? H-Hey!

What are you doing under the bed?!

I-It's just a kid! Just
take the knife from him!

Th-That knife's dangerous! Put it down!

Riiiiip

Wh-What are you—

I'll protect you, Dad.

Don't worry. Take your time getting better.

At the age of twelve,
Bruno Bucciarati committed murder

and entered a territory
no one should set foot in.

I can't turn back now.

They'll keep trying to get
revenge and shut us up.

I can't trust the police, either.

The only one willing to
protect this father and son

was the organization that ran
the city from the shadows.

Bucciarati knocked on the
doors of that organization,

and in return for loyalty and
service to the organization,

they guaranteed their safety.

Believing the organization
was the true form of justice,

he worked hard there.

He made a name for himself
within the organization,

and eventually, the capo
Polpo took a liking to him.

Five years later, Bucciarati's father died
due to complications from his wounds.

Bucciarati loathed the white
powder of greed that had

dragged him and his
father into this situation,

and swore that he would never forgive it.

But...

I-I'm sorry! I won't bother them again!

I'll forget about that family!

Good. You can't regret anything
once you're dead, after all.

If you're also a gang member—

Those are...

Hey! What the hell are those?!

He learned that the organization's boss,
whom he thought was the true form of justice,

was involved in dealing
the drugs he hated so much.

In this city?

I thought they were prohibited!

And now...

The boss is now...

The most repulsive form of evil is

to exploit innocent people
who don't know anything,

and to use others merely for one's own gain!

A father did this to his innocent daughter,

all to cover his own ass?!

This is unforgivable!

You have once again betrayed my heart!

There... Trish is still alive.

All right. It's on him.

But, damn it, I can't see his face.

Boss, I was just going to
seek out your true identity,

but the plan's changed.

I'm going to get rid of you right now!

There's no time,

but the boss isn't expecting
me to betray him right now.

It will be...

an assassination.

I'll get ahead of the boss on his
escape route and finish him there.

This...

This hole...

I see.

It's a stairway to the charnel house that's
found in the basement of any church.

After he eliminates Trish down there,
thinking he's in the clear,

he'll go through there and exit
the other side of the building.

I managed to get here first.

Here he comes.

He came down the stairs!

Now!

You should just go home now,

Bruno Bucciarati.

If you step out from behind that pillar,

you're going to die.

Zipper Man!

I-It's going to break off!

So he knew I was after him...

But since he hid himself again,

I'm guessing he's not that powerful.

I'd like to ask you why.

What's the meaning of this?

I highly respected all the work
you'd done for me on this mission.

Were you so happy to become
a capo that you got greedy?

Or did you overestimate your
own powers and get cocky,

thinking you could actually surpass me?

When Trish wakes up,

I'm going to tell her that
her father didn't even exist.

Trish?

What about Trish?

My daughter has nothing to do with you.

You could never understand my true feelings!

Giorno?

Bucciarati! Yes, I know he's on the move.

I know exactly where the boss is because
of the brooch you put on him.

Right now, he's at the bottom of
the stairs to the charnel house.

He's right by the pillar that's about
two meters away from the stairs.

But wait, Bucciarati!

Something is wrong!

You're there!

Take this! Zipper Man!

The one who was in the pillar's shadow...

was me!

Wh-What...

What's going o—

I decided to show you... as a parting gift.

Since this is the end, I'll fill you in.

What you just witnessed and felt

was you in the future.

You from a few seconds from the
past witnessed yourself in the future.

This is my Emperor Crimson's ability.

I erased time and leapt past it.

I don't care who it is.

I will not allow anyone
to threaten my throne,

no matter what.

And now, you're going to have to disappear.

Bucciarati, your mission to
act as Trish's bodyguard

has now come to an end.

Episodio 21
The Mystery of Emperor CrimsonEpisodio 21 The Mystery of Emperor Crimson

Damn it, Narancia!

Who do you think you are,
trying to eat all the chocolates yourself?

Give them back!

I bought them with my own
money, so give them back!

Narancia, I swear...

There are only three left!

What a greedy little shit.

We've all been waiting for these,
and we're hungry!

The ladybug brooch is moving
from the top of the tower.

I can feel it.

It's heading to the charnel house below

to try to cross through there.

Bucciarati must've put the brooch
somewhere on the boss's clothes.

Sorry, Giorno, but could
you grab that water?

I'm a bit thirsty.

Also, you should be careful.

We've been ordered to wait
here on the boat for now,

and not set foot on the island.

Right.

Huh? Eh?

Y-You ate them, didn't you, Mista?!

Give them back, damn it!

And what the hell do you have on your mouth?

Huh?

Ah!

"Ah," my ass! You little shit!

S-So sweet!
When did you stuff them in your mouth?

By the way, I didn't thank
you yet, did I, Giorno?

For grabbing the water.

Something's... bizarre...

I don't know what,

but something's strange.

Hey, you bastard!

Didn't you hear that the boss ordered
us not to set foot on the is—

...land?

Huh?!

This isn't normal.

Something weird is going on!

This isn't good! Bucciarati!

Where do you think you're going, Giorno?!

Is that you, Giorno?

Bucciarati!

Yes, I know he's on the move.

I know exactly where the boss is because
of the brooch you put on him.

Right now, he's at the bottom of
the stairs to the charnel house.

He's right by the pillar that's about
two meters away from the stairs.

But wait, Bucciarati!

Something is wrong!

Bucciarati, your mission to
act as Trish's bodyguard

has now come to an end.

Wh-Why, you...

He's trying to immobilize my arm.

Zipper Man!

But... Emperor Crimson has already...

...seen through it.

Your movements in the future.

The trajectory of your
movements in the future.

Within Emperor Crimson's ability,
this world's time disappears,

and no one remembers the movements
they made within this segment of time.

The clouds in the sky don't
realize they've broken apart.

A flame that's extinguished doesn't even
realize the moment it went out.

All that remains in this
world are the results.

In the world where time has been eliminated,
all movement becomes pointless!

I am the only one who can
react to these movements.

I can see every single
one of your movements!

This is Emperor Crimson's ability!

Th-This ability...

No matter who you may be,

everyone goes through their ups and downs.

You succeed, and you fail.

But if you happen to find the pitfall known
as the future that's right in front of you

and manage to not fall in,

you will never experience
a setback in your life.

You will remain in your best condition.

Don't you think so?

Now that I've actually met you,
I can tell that we are indeed related.

I can sense that you are,
without a doubt, my daughter.

Which means...

When you are awake, you will feel
the exact same way toward me!

Trish...

I must fill any pitfall
that threatens my path!

I will now sever this bond
of blood that binds us!

Trish!

Dogyuuuuun

Dogyuuuuun

Wh-What?!

That must be Giorno...

Giorno's Golden Wind's ability...

He planted the turtle's cells in
the brooch and gave it life,

and a turtle with Stand abilities was born.

Since our call was interrupted,
he must've sensed something was wrong

and activated his ability.

He always gives me courage...

I didn't think I could move
anymore, but... Not yet.

I still...

have to keep moving a little bit more.

My mission's done? You're wrong, Boss.

It's still ongoing!

As for Trish...

I will protect her on my own order!

If he can read all of my attacks,

and I can't even realize
that he's dodged them,

then his ability surpasses
all others in its invincibility.

But...

This ability doesn't allow him to
read one's movements for long!

It's only a short time.

It seems to be around five to ten seconds.

Distance...

For now, I need to get
as far away as possible!

I need to get far enough that
the boss can't find Trish!

I beg of you to keep moving, body.

Don't let me waste this
chance that Giorno gave me!

Until I can get out of this basement...

It seems there was another traitor.

Must be the newbie.

Rumble

If my information is correct,
I believe his name is Giorno Giovanna.

Rumble

So he must've joined this organization with
the intent to betray me from the start.

It seems you thought you could escape
just by distancing yourself from me,

but it's nothing for me to escape
that turtle an instant sooner.

It appears that your efforts
were futile, Bucciarati.

How are you still able to move?

Sheer willpower?

If you just rest, you won't be
able to get to the first floor,

but you'll be able to die peacefully.

First, I'm going to eliminate Trish.

Don't you dare move, Bucciarati!

The chance that Giorno gave me wasn't in vain!

If this is going to be about
reading each other's moves,

I've already read yours!

I knew before you fell into the sewer

that you'd probably use
your ability to escape!

Now, Zipper Man!

Emperor Crimson!

That was close...

But within Emperor Crimson's world,

your efforts are still futile!

Take this!

You're finished!

It wasn't you that I was trying to attack!

It was this pillar!

Zipper, close!

What?!

As I thought...
Your ability is invincible...

But it appears that you can only
read movements for a short time.

You're not reading ahead of time.

Just try and read my future
movements, Boss.

Try to figure out what I'm going
to do in a few seconds.

Try to see beyond time.

You should be able to see me

after I've reached the first floor.

Bucciarati! Trish!

This wound...

What happened in the basement?!

Where's the boss?

He should still be around...

Somewhere close by.

I don't know the whole situation,
but there's no way

the boss is just going to
let Bucciarati go after this!

Bucciarati...

N-No...

Bucciarati!

His pulse...

I-Impossible! It's gone!

I created the parts needed for his recovery!

Bucciarati, please breathe!

So this must be Giorno Giovanna.

His unknown ability gave Bucciarati
the chance to escape.

However...

I will not let them get away!

This is impossible!

I know I created the parts!

There's no way he shouldn't have a heartbeat!

Giorno, it's me.

Call Abbacchio and the others.

Get out of here.

That voice...

I told you to call Abbacchio and the others.

Get out of here!

Out of this church!

Hurry!

B-Bucciarati!

Th-Thank goodness!

You're okay!

Hurry! Hurry up and call the others!

B-But...

We can't figure out who the
boss actually is right now.

We need to get out of here, Giorno!
While we're still far enough from him!

They're within my range!

Here I go!

I'll explain later! Hurry up, Giorno!

Golden Wind!

Giorno's over there!

Hey, Giorno, you bastard! Come back here!

How are you gonna make up for disobeying
orders and stepping onto the island?!

Bucciarati's here, too!

H-How the hell did you get so injured?!

Why do you still have Trish with you?!

What's going on here, Bucciarati?

I'll explain everything later.

Right now, we need to get out
of here as fast as we can.

I commend you, Bucciarati.

I commend your precise and
keen decision making.

Even though I have the
ability to eliminate time,

if I were to face all six of those Stand users,

one of them would end up
learning my true identity.

For the moment,

they've managed to escape
my Emperor Crimson.

But this is not the end.

I will never...

let you escape

from Venice!

Now I understand why the boss is feared by
everyone and how he ruled over all of us.

We can't defeat the boss... not now.

As for his identity...

Assuming it even has one,

we'll need to find his
ability's weakness first!

Emperor Crimson

What...

What the hell's going on, Bucciarati?

We need an explanation.

What the hell are you doing?

All right. I'll just come out and say it.

But I can't explain everything right now,

because there's no time and
danger's right around the corner.

The reason I brought Trish back

is because I betrayed the boss just now.

I'll be leaving you guys now.

If you go with me,
you will also become traitors.

Wh-What?

I-I don't think I heard you right...

Wh-What did you just say?

He said... he betrayed the boss.

B-But why?

You probably shouldn't hear any more,

because you guys have
nothing to do with this.

I think you should explain.

Some of them might want to follow you.

We need people on our side.

What the hell is your deal, Giorno?!

First, you go into the church
without permission, and now—

Bucciarati!

What's wrong? Are you all right?

I'm fine.

I lost a lot of blood, so I got a bit dizzy.

That shouldn't be possible...

When I created his parts, it should've
also replenished the blood he lost.

Did I miss a wound?

I guess I've used up a good deal of energy.

Does he not feel pain? There was no
blood coming from the wound, either.

Was I just seeing things?

I'm sorry.

You had me worried for a sec!

For real.

Bucciarati, please...

Yeah, Bucciarati.

We want to know the details.

The boss had us act as her bodyguards

so that he could kill his daughter
with his own two hands.

Because she shares his blood, she could
have figured out his true identity.

I found that out and...

I couldn't forgive him.

I couldn't just come back
pretending I didn't see that.

That's why I betrayed him!

How could you?

Are you insane, Bucciarati?

You know exactly what happens to traitors,

no matter who it is.

The boss never lets anyone get away!

Hell, Venice could already be
surrounded by the boss's elite guard!

You're right, and that's why
I'm going to need help.

If any of you are willing to accompany me,

come down these stairs and get on the boat.

But I will not order any
of you to come with me.

I won't even ask you to come with me.

I did this all on my own.

So you don't need to feel
obligated to come with me.

This may come off as arrogant,
but I'm going to say it anyway.

I did this because I believe I'm right.

I have no regrets.

Despite the world we live in, I want to
continue on the path that I believe in.

If we can just find his weakness...

Though we're only fleeing for now,

I will defeat the boss, no matter what.

I will find his weakness, no matter what!

I understand your reasons, and what
you did was right, Bucciarati.

But I'm going to be blunt...

I hate to say it, but no one's
going to get on that boat.

How could you let your
emotions take over like that?

I owe you my life, but going with you
now would be a different matter.

You've lost sight of reality.

No one can survive in this world
on expectations alone.

We can't survive without the organization.

Fugo's absolutely right.

What you did is basically suicide.

No matter where in the
world you might run to,

you'll never find a safe haven again.

Besides, I pledged my loyalty
to the organization.

It's not like I pledged my loyalty to you.

That being said...

I never had a home or place I wanted to go.

The only time I'm ever at ease

is when I'm with you, Bucciarati.

Abbacchio...

Y-You can't be serious, Abbacchio!

If we actually manage to defeat the boss...

Considering my skills,

I'd say I'm next in line to become a capo.

Bucciarati's smart.

He never goes into a fight that
he has no chance of winning.

We're gonna strike it rich for sure.

Mista! Not you, too!

What are you going to do, Fugo?

You've all l-lost your minds!

We're going to be completely isolated!

Where are you going to run to?

No, you won't even make it
out of Venice alive!

Narancia,

what are you going to do?

I-I... d-don't know what to do...

Tell me, Bucciarati...

What should I do?

Do you think I should go?

Are you scared?

Yeah... I'm r-really scared...

B-But just order me!

If you order me to go with you,
I'll be more confident!

Nothing scares me, as long
as you order me to do it!

No.

This is one thing I can't order you to do.
You need to decide for yourself.

You need to choose your own path.

B-But I don't know what to do! I don't know!

But let me just give you this warning.

Don't come with me, Narancia.

You're not cut out for this.

Are you serious about this?

You'll be killed, without a doubt.

There are some things in this world that
you just can't do, even if you're right.

Our job has always been dirty.

How is this any different?

Even then... I can't lie to myself.

Let's go!

Once the boat takes off,
you're officially traitors!

Why? You're insane!

All this for a woman you just
met and barely talked to!

You don't even know what
kind of music she likes!

Trish was abandoned by
the people she trusted...

I was also abandoned before.

I was abandoned by my dad
and the friends I trusted.

We're sort of alike...

It's none of our business what
the boss does with his daughter!

Trish and I are sort of alike!
All he had to do was close his eyes!
I just don't understand!

Giorno, give me the turtle.

Let's put Trish inside it.

Okay.

Bucciarati, please turn around.

Bucciarati!

I'll go! I'll go, too! I'm coming with you!

Don't order me not to go with you!

Trish is me! She's me!
The wound on her arm is my own!

Narancia... Not you, too...

You fool... You're going to be killed.

I can't go along with
such a foolish betrayal.

I can't become a righteous idiot...

You took way too long to make your decision.

You'd better not hold this
against us later on.

Narancia, I have nothing but
respect for your courage.

I guess Fugo didn't come after all.

That was his choice to make.

Bucciarati!

I... I want to protect Trish!

I'll defeat the boss with you!

Yeah.

Squalo?

We have some traitors... in Venice.

The names of the traitors are
Bruno Bucciarati and Giorno Giovanna.

The boss's identity: Unknown
Stand name: Emperor Crimson
Has the ability to eliminate a certain amount of time.
Because of this, he can predict the future. Invincible.

They can be taken dead or alive.

This is straight from the boss!

Special Program
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind
determinazioneIt doesn't look like anyone's following us.

Bucciarati, are we not leaving Venice?

The boss has his own personal elite guards.

I'm sure they've already
learned of our betrayal.

They're probably... going to
be coming after us next.

But we don't know what kind
of abilities they have.

Correct. If we try to cross
the sea unprepared,

they might strike us there.

Let's wait and see for now.

Understood.

Mista!

We're hungry!

I'm starving!

Feed us!

Our guts are running on empty!

Calm the hell down!

I know this is really bad timing,

but could we stop by a
restaurant or something?

Well...

I guess we need to refill our guts, as well.

Episodio 22 The "G" in Guts

You guys have heard of vegetarians, right?

Are they allowed to eat, like, cheese?

Probably not.

I mean, milk and eggs come
from cows and chickens.

That means they probably can't have
cake that uses whipped cream, either.

What?! They can't have cake, either?

I wonder if their bodies actually
function better, then.

Then what do those guys do
about shoes or handbags?

Those are made from leather.

Well, if they're vegetarians
because they feel bad for animals,

they probably wear sneakers
and carry backpacks instead.

Man, they're intense.

So would you have old ladies dressing
like basketball players, then?

They'd never let them into a
restaurant looking like that.

Giorno, being all scared won't
make anything happen.

Let's just eat for now.

Yes, I know...
Still, we need to be on our guard.

For example, there's a possibility
someone could've poisoned our food.

Y-You bastard! What the hell
do you think you're doing?!

Huh?

What are you gonna do about
this, you little shit?!

You think you can pay for this?!
This suit cost four million lire!

Let's take this outside!

Smash

You must be an enemy!

What?!

You an enemy?! Huh?!

Well, are you?!

You an enemy?! Take that! And that!

Hold it, Narancia, Mista.

I don't think this guy's an enemy.

He's unconscious.

He's totally just a random civilian.

What? Are you serious?

Crap! What am I gonna do?

Yeah, this stain's gonna
be hard to get out.

A single drop of wine on a
white suit really stands out.

I can't pay for this shit!

Well, the location of the stain
might make it look like a button.

If he puts a button there, he can hide it.

While we're at it, let's get him to make
sure there isn't any poison in our food.

That's a great idea!

Hey, that's enough.

More importantly...

What's going on with Bucciarati right now?

After that battle with the boss,
Bucciarati's heart definitely stopped.

And when he got hurt back there,
there wasn't a single drop of blood.

What about now?

But right now isn't the best time to find out.

I'll keep this secret to myself for now.

So, Bucciarati, what are
we going to do now?

The boss's Stand makes time disappear,

and the boss is the only one who
can move freely in that state.

He's invincible.

It doesn't matter who it is.

Anyone's attack becomes
useless before that Stand.

However...

That'll change once we find
out who the boss is!

Because if we find out the boss's identity,

we might be able to assassinate him.

And to do that, we need to find out

who he really is.

But how are we going to find him?

The boss is the type of guy who's
gotten rid of any trace of himself.

Trish.

There must be some kind
of hint involving Trish.

Everyone was after Trish, and the
boss was trying to eliminate Trish.

Right?

A-About that...

I don't really want to involve
Trish in this anymore...

Th-This feeling sucks.

Trish doesn't know anything!

If she finds out her actual father tried
to kill her, she'll be in shock.

Bucciarati, please!

Let's not talk about the boss's identity
and stuff like that in front of her.

There's no need for that, Narancia.

I've already known that... for a while.

T-Trish...

I remembered something when you said
he got rid of any trace of himself.

My mother had mentioned that
she met my father in Sardinia.

Sardinia...

When I was little, my mother told me

that they had met while she was vacationing,

and he told her he'd be right back...

But then he disappeared forever,
leaving nothing behind,

not even a photo or his name.

Before he became the
boss of the organization...

Fifteen years ago...

Then was he born and raised in...

I'm not sure about all that, but...

Sardinia. His past and true
identity should be in Sardinia.

Why are you telling us that?

We might end up killing your father!

No, we are determined to defeat him!

You defeating him or not isn't my problem.

But... I want to know!

I want to know who I came from!

I'm not about to die
before I find that out!

Hey, Narancia.

Looks like she's way stronger than you thought.

Fine.

Sardinia...

That's our next destination
after we escape from Venice.

That's where we'll find out
who the boss really is.

I was under the impression
that Trish was like me,

but I guess she'd already made up her mind.

I just followed on a whim,
so I still don't know

if there's any hope in this trip or not.

Huh?

An enemy! There's an enemy nearby!

There's a shark in my soup!

Li'l Bomber!

Giorno! Get Trish inside the turtle!

Abbacchio, cover the right!
Mista, guard the left!

Where, Narancia? Where are they?

Inside the soup!
They were somehow already in it!

Where are they now?

But they were there!

There was something like
a shark in my soup!

I don't see anything strange about it.

Does that mean we lost them?

Swoosh

Narancia!

What happened?!

Narancia! Were you attacked somewhere?

Where did they get you?

Narancia, what's wrong? What's there?!

I'm asking you what's wrong, Narancia!

Hold it, Mista.
I don't think Narancia can talk...

What? You can't talk?

What's wrong, Narancia?
What are you pointing at?

Water? You want a sip of water?

H-Hey! Th-This is bad! Look!

Narancia's tongue! It's gone!

On top of that, I don't
think he's breathing!

This isn't good.

I can use Golden Wind to
create parts for his tongue,

but it'll take time to finish.

Hey, come on! He's about to suffocate here!

Mista, do you have a pen?

A pen?! Y-Yeah, I have one...

Stab

Looks like he's breathing.

I'll give life to this pen to
create parts for his tongue.

That way, he can breathe
while I create his tongue.

I see...

So that's Giorno Giovanna.

Now I'm starting to understand the
information the boss gave us.

We're going to have to be the most
careful around that newbie kid.

Yeah... I'm a bit surprised
he saved Narancia.

I thought my Crush would
be enough for this job,

but apparently, I'm going to need your
help eliminating all five of them,

Tiziano.

As the boss's elite guards,
we're going to have to defeat him here.

Are you ready, Squalo?

All according to plan.

As long as we can lure them to
water, Crush is invincible.

Our plan will decide everything.

We'll take care of them
one at a time, Tiziano.

Yeah, Squalo...

We'll use Narancia.

Crush

Squalo

Are you all right, Narancia?

Yeah...

You guys saved me.

What did you see?

How did the enemy Stand attack?

It... c-came from the soup...

Narancia, don't force it.

I-I'm fine. I can talk.

Hey, Narancia, what's the enemy like?

Where'd he run off to?

He was...

He was like a pebble!

He was huge, and he ran into the restaurant!

Huh? Huge like a pebble?

But earlier, you were saying
it was in your soup!

You're contradicting yourself.

Huh? Did I just say that?

So, then... is the enemy about this big?

Nope.

Huh? No, wait!

Then, like, this big?

U-Um...

No? Then, like, this big?

Yup, exactly.

So something this big was in your soup,

and it went running into the restaurant?

Yup.

Huh? What?

We can't get a clear picture
of this enemy at all.

Does that mean it was really fast?

Nope! It was slow!

What?

Huh?!

If it was huge and slow,
why didn't we see it?

Did you actually see a Stand?

Of course I did... n—

You keep contradicting yourself!

You're not trying to act tough
because the enemy got you, are you?

I... I...

Answer me, damn it!
You didn't actually see anything, did you?

Of course I did...

not...

So you didn't actually
see anything, after all!

This is no time to screw around!

There's no one suspicious nearby.

Apparently, it's a remote-controlled Stand.

That must mean that the user
is watching us from somewhere.

In that case, we should
leave here immediately.

Let's follow the channel out to the sea.

Yeah, Giorno!

Let's do it! Let's use the channel!

Yes, Narancia. That's what I just...

Narancia?

Narancia, why do you keep
covering your mouth?

Let me see it.

What the hell? It's completely normal.

Yup! I'm totally fine!

There's no problem at all, Mista!

So, what are we going to do, Bucciarati?

Are we going out to sea?

No. Let's not follow the channel just yet.

This is our chance.

We're going to use it to defeat that enemy!

The boss wasn't expecting our betrayal,

which means there probably aren't that
many members of his elite guard here.

If we defeat him now,

I'm sure we'll be able to get through
the seas of Venice just fine.

I see. You have a point. I agree.

Yeah, I agree.

Very well, Bucciarati.

If you say so.

Abbacchio, could you use your
Moody Jazz to replay what happened?

Yeah, sure.

Where do you want to start?

From when the soup was still on the table?

Yeah.

What the hell, Narancia?

Guys! The enemy's right over there!

Over there? You mean inside
the restaurant's bathroom?

Narancia, you damn well better
have seen something this time!

Yup, I did!

After them. We'll settle things
with this enemy here and now.

Come on, Giorno. Let's go.

Right...

Well done, Narancia.

None of his friends realize
that there's another Stand

besides Crush, which travels
from liquid to liquid.

Yes, they don't realize that my Stand,

Talking Mouth, is attached to
your tongue and making you say

the exact opposite of what you mean.

All right, I'm gonna go kill
the rest of them. Grazie.

Schwing

S-So that's what was going on! Damn it!

They were using me to get everyone
near the water, one by one.

How dare you underestimate me?!

I don't sense anyone here...

Let's at least figure out
what the enemy looks like.

Moody Jazz!

Transform into whoever was in here a
few dozen seconds ago, and pursue them!

Narancia!

Seeing who the enemy is
through Moody Jazz is fine,

but don't pursue them!

If it gets into water,
they don't stand a chance!

In that case, I'll do everything I
can to keep them away from water!

Over here...

Moody Jazz is transforming.

Water's bad news! Don't look in there!

Look at me! Look in here!

What the hell? That's disgusting!

Come over here, Abbacchio!

Look in here!

What are you talking about?
Have you turned into some kind of pervert?

We're trying to investigate because
you said you saw the enemy in here!

Did you really see them in here?

Of course, I—

Seriously, what is your problem?

Bucciarati, there's a chance Narancia
was just seeing things in here.

We might be better off looking at
the table if we want to pursue them.

Yeah.

Cut the crap, Narancia!

I'm not gonna let you take us all down!

Narancia, what happened to your finger?

Did you snag it somewhere?

Here, I'll stop the bleeding.

That bastard's going to try
to use my blood to move.

N-No! S-Stay back, Giorno!

Yeah! Fix me right up, Giorno!

There's definitely something strange.

Is something wrong with
the inside of your mouth?

They attacked your tongue earlier.
Does that have anything to do with it?

Great job, Giorno! You're so intuitive.

Just a little more...

Just a little more,
and Giorno will figure it out.

But you're bleeding really badly.

First, let's take care of that wound.

Now, let me see it.

No! You can't touch the blood!

Come on, Narancia.

This is bad! Stay back!

Hurry!

Li'l Bomber!

Damn it...

Narancia,

you seem to be under attack by something,

but there must be some reason
you can't tell us the truth.

Yes! He figured it out!

Was there something left in your
mouth from the first attack?

Like, an ability that makes you say
the opposite of what you mean?

Yes! That's it, Giorno!

Sh-Shit! There's water from the pipe!

Giorno!

Episodio 23
Crush and Talking MouthNone of his friends realize
that there's another Stand.

Yes, they don't realize that my Stand,

Talking Mouth, is attached to
your tongue and making you say

the exact opposite of what you mean.

Narancia,

there must be some reason
you can't tell us the truth.

Giorno!

Giorno's getting pulled under!

Even though the water's so shallow!

Li'l Bomber!

The bastard is teleporting
from liquid to liquid

while still holding on to Giorno's body,

despite there being so little water!

Yes! I got him.

If we first take care of Giorno Giovanna,
who controls life and can heal his friends,

it'll be a piece of cake to eliminate
the rest of his friends one by one.

Yeah, it's all going according to plan.

But we should finish off
Giorno immediately, Squalo.

Huh?

According to my information,
Narancia's Li'l Bomber can track carbon dioxide.

Even though Giorno's
unconscious right now,

if he's breathing, your Crush,
which bit into him, will be tracked down.

Even if you jump from liquid to liquid.

It won't be good if Li'l Bomber tracks
down your location and gets ahead.

It'll track us down.

All right, Tiziano.

I'll stop Giorno's breathing.

Right now.

Episodio 23 Crush and Talking Mouth

This isn't good.

I can't let them take Giorno away!

This enemy...

So there were already two Stands here?

Shit! The more I miss,

the more I'm spreading the water around
and giving them the upper hand!

I have to get ahead of them!

Where are they? Where'd they go?!

There!

They may be able to teleport,
but if I can get ahead of them,

I can fill them full of holes!

He's got his radar out.

As I figured, he's going to try
to track us down and shoot us.

We should stop Giorno's
breathing immediately.

Quit being so pushy. I know, Tiz.

But it sure is hard to attack
Giorno while teleporting!

I got the timing down! Now!

Wha— Into his neck?!

Giorno! I-I didn't mean to shoot you!

Wh-What? His breathing...

The symbol indicating Giorno's breathing...

It disappeared from the radar!

Shit! They got away!

Excellent. Crush went into the sewers.

I'm just going to continue down into the
canal and dispose of Giorno's body.

Hold it. What was that, Squalo?

I said I'd take his body to the canal and...

No, I'm talking about Narancia.

I almost didn't hear it,
but he definitely said it!

He said, "They got away!" With his voice!

As long as my Talking Mouth is on his tongue,

he should only be able to say
the opposite of his intent.

But he said, "They got away!"

He even said the radar symbol disappeared.

Squalo! Move from there immediately!

What are you talking about, Tiziano?

Giorno's not breathing at all!

There's no one else who
can track down my Crush!

He said, "They got away!" on purpose!

It was to put you at ease!

It was to stop Crush's
teleportation for even a moment!

I don't know how, but he's
definitely tracking you!

Back then, Giorno moved on
purpose so I'd shoot him.

That way, there'd be residue from the
gunshots, and I could actually track him!

I can see him.

I can see him clear as day!

Here we go! I'm gonna fill them with holes!

Here I come, you bastard!

This means Giorno's not dead yet!

If we can resuscitate him within
a few minutes, he'll be saved!

This isn't good, Squalo!

Now that he's fired at you twice,

he's going to go after the
residue from your bullet wounds!

I did it! I got him out of the sewers!

It's no use, Bucciarati.

I can't replay this enemy any further.

I know for sure that they were
in this cup on top of this table.

But they were only there for a moment.

From there, Moody Jazz can't
transform, nor go forward.

What do you mean, Abbacchio?

I don't know. Maybe they can teleport.

But I don't have the answer.

The replay for this enemy...

It won't go any further,
like a video tape that's been torn.

I can't believe Narancia would go this far...

No, it's Giorno.

This all happened because
Giorno intentionally got shot

by Li'l Bomber's guns.

Shit! I can't get rid of the residue!

Even in the water!

Because the bullets were from a Stand.

I have to disappear somehow.

Somewhere he can't detect me!

I've been watching...

and this shark bastard is pretty damn
fast for a remote-controlled Stand,

but it looks like it can't get
very far in a single leap.

Looks to be about two to three meters!

Shit!

H-His attacks are becoming more precise!

It could be due to injuries,
but their speed's getting slower!

Squalo!

Yes! Now I just need to end
this with a finishing blow!

Take this, you fishy bastard!

Th-This smell...

There's a gas leak!

This is all according to plan, Narancia.

Because you shot,

hot water spilled from the pot
and extinguished the burner.

Now Li'l Bomber won't be
able to shoot its guns!

Now you can't track me!

If one of the sparks from your
gun happens to ignite the gas,

you may survive, but everything
around there will burn,

filling the room with carbon dioxide,
and you won't be able to find me anymore!

Narancia, just go ahead and try to shoot

those guns!

We've won!

You know, if I can't shoot...

I have other ways of killing you!

Yes! I got the enemy!

Bucciarati! Mista! The enemy's here!

Abbacchio, the enemy's able to
move from liquid to liquid!

Giorno's breathing again!

Huh?

Wait. What did I just say?

Why was I able to speak the truth?

Squalo, I've released Talking
Mouth from Narancia's tongue,

just like you planned.

You're pretty badly injured, but I'm
sure the boss will be satisfied.

Did you just yell something, Narancia?!

Did you say the enemy's over here?

But the release of Talking
Mouth is only temporary.

Giorno's... That must be the enemy!

Wh-What?!

W-Wai—

We win, Squalo.

Yes... This is all according to plan!

Here we go, Six Bullets!

Shoot, Mista!

Wh-What?!

Sh-Shit! My radar!

I can't track them! They're going to attack!

Giorno's going to be taken
because of my lie!

N-Narancia!

L-Look for it!

G-Giorno!

Don't go after the Stand...

Go after the user!

Giorno!

Hey, Narancia!

You bastard! Why'd you tell me to shoot?!

This room was filled with gas!

Look out! It's the enemy!
The enemy's above!

No! Below! The enemy's below!

What?!

Guys!

It's no use! I can't stop
myself from talking!

I have to stop talking!

It disappeared!

They're planning to eliminate
Giorno before anyone else!

Don't go after the Stand...

Go after the user!

Giorno!

Giorno told me to find the user.

Right... They're hurt.

Because they're hurt,
their breathing is probably labored.

So that's what he means.

He wants me to use my radar to find them.

I'm alone in this. I have to do this alone.

Someone who's breathing hard...

They have a remote-controlled Stand,

but they have to be somewhere around here.

There's no time! I have to
be quick and find them!

Talking Mouth

Tiziano

Okay, this is all according to plan.

With Giorno gone, there's no
one to fix their injuries.

Now, finish off Giorno.

For good.

Yeah, I'll do it.

I've been injured,

but I have plenty of strength
left to attack him.

Hey, look. It's Narancia.

What's he doing out here?

Where is Crush right now?

Over there.

It exited the restaurant's sewer pipe
and is heading down the canal.

He shouldn't be able to track it anymore...

Don't tell me he's trying
to find me instead!

My breathing...

Calm down, Squalo.

That's impossible.

He's just struggling because
he's run out of options.

How many people do you think there
are within hundred meters of here?

Fifty? A hundred?

There's no way he could tell
you apart from the others.

But I'm injured.

If he's trying to find someone
with labored breathing...

Don't panic, Squalo.

Look at the bottom of the stairs.

There are many with even more labored
breathing than you in that square.

Calm yourself and your breathing.

If we hide your injuries and head into the
square like nothing's wrong, we'll be safe.

We still win!

Yeah, you're right... You're exactly right.

There's no way he'd find us.

I found you!

You're right there!

Wh-What?!

Shit! I have to retrieve Crush!

Calm down, Squalo! Think this through!

He can only say the opposite of
what he's thinking right now.

He said he found us,
meaning he hasn't found us!

Don't forget that!

Then why did he bother saying that?!

He wants you to panic and make your
breathing even more labored!

Please calm down. If you panic,
it's exactly what he wants.

There's no way Narancia can single you out.

This is just his futile, last-ditch attempt.

Calm your breathing.

I found you...

There you are.

I finally... found you.

He said it again!

Please, calm down.

He hasn't found us. That's fact.

He's definitely lying!

My Talking Mouth is still
definitely on his tongue...

H-Hey, look!

Wh-What?!

He cut out his own tongue!

With his own knife!

That's impossible!

No one can survive after
cutting out their own tongue,

let alone speak!

I found... you!

H-He has another tongue!

The ladybug became a tongue!

It can't be!

It's Giorno!

Giorno Giovanna!

Just as the boss had said,
he's the biggest problem!

That bastard Giorno must've created a tongue

for Narancia in the kitchen
and given it to him!

He's coming! He's heading this way!

So he was tracking my breathing!

It's the opposite!

If he was actually tracking you,
he would've attacked already!

Considering the number of people out
here, there's all kinds of breathing.

Labored breathing, slow breathing...

There's so much that I
can't single anyone out.

But I've been waiting...

I've been waiting for this...

For the moment when someone's breathing
drastically changes suddenly!

For someone to change their
breathing drastically

after seeing me cut my
tongue out with a knife!

For someone to see their Stand
hanging out along with my tongue

and panic bigtime!

That's what I've been waiting for!

Just when I thought I'd lost you
guys and was about to give up!

You, over there!

Your breathing just fluctuated, didn't it?!

Yeah, you! I'm talking to you!

I'm talking to you, long hair!

This can't be!

He actually cut out his tongue to track me!

Which must mean the shark user
is the dude next to you!

He seems pretty damn pale.

Squalo, retrieve Crush!

I'm already on it!

It's traveling through the sewers
and heading toward that well.

But... there's no water here!

There's no liquid that Crush
can jump at Narancia from!

You must be him!

The guy who dragged Giorno away!

Tiziano!

Now you have some liquid... Squalo.

This didn't... go exactly
according to plan...

But this doesn't change our victory.

We're still going to... win...

I don't give a damn about the
boss's orders anymore.

I'm not going to kill you because I was
ordered to as one of the elite guard.

Tiziano... I'm going to
eliminate him for you!

I'll kill all of Narancia's friends, too!

I'll rip them to pieces and make them pay!

I'll make them all pay!

Crush! Rip out his throat!

Do you think... I'm going to falter?

Because of... Because of something like this?

We're...

going to get the hell out of Venice,

completely safe and sound.

See ya...

Volare via.

"Go flying"

You're a damn traitor...

You're supposed to be
eliminated by the boss...

You're supposed to have no choice
but to fear your future...

What in the world is driving them forward?

Why does it seem like they have hope?

Wh-What could it...

Someone just collapsed!

Giorno!

Y-Yes! He's breathing again, faintly!

Giorno, wake up! Giorno! Giorno!

Narancia...

Abbacchio doesn't think too highly of you,

but we all end up moving
under your direction,

as though you're leading us...

We might actually have some hope
for this journey... with you around.

Giorno, let's get back to everyone else.

How long has it been
since the attack began?

Four to five minutes?

Anyway, it's hard to imagine
that another assassin

from the organization is
in Venice right now.

It should be wide open.

Let's head toward the airport!

We'll get a plane!

We're going to get a plane and head
to Sardinia, no matter what.

We must find out about the boss's
past as quickly as possible...

or we lose.

Episodio 24
Notorious ChaseIt's hard to imagine
that another assassin

from the organization is
in Venice right now.

It should be wide open.

Let's head toward the airport!

We'll get a plane!

We're going to get a plane and head
to Sardinia, no matter what.

We must find out about the boss's
past as quickly as possible...

or we lose.

Marco Polo International Airport

I don't feel any life energy.

There are no living creatures on
this plane, not even a cockroach.

All right, let's take this plane.

Don't let any living creature
or machine near this airplane.

After taking off, an airplane glides at
a few thousand to ten thousand meters

at a speed of around 800 kilometers per hour.

Once in the air, there's no
Stand user who can control

that kind of speed or power from the ground.

Our destination is Sardinia.

The flight should be around two hours.

Episodio 24 Notorious Chase

You're gonna fly this thing
with Moody Jazz's replay?

B-But there's no guarantee that
this thing flew to Sardinia.

I'm pretty sure there's this
thing called INS that lets you

put in a destination, and it'll
get you there automatically.

I saw it in a movie once.

If I find the INS and input our destination,
there shouldn't be an issue.

Really? You're going by what was in a movie?

Abbacchio, how long until takeoff?

No idea. I can't exactly fast forward this.

It'll probably take around ten minutes.

Bucciarati's leg... Was it injured
in the restaurant battle?

Still, despite how deep that
cut looks, he's barely bleeding.

Up front, to the left! Something's coming!

Something's heading our way, Mista!

Stop right there!

Just so you know,

anyone who gets near this plane will
be shot dead, even if they're a saint!

And it's not like a saint would even come here.

If you care about your well-being at all,

you'll turn your back to this plane
and get the hell off this runway!

Apparently your ears are plugged up
with wax, but do your best to listen.

I'll warn you one last time.

I'll let you go, so get
the hell off this runway.

He's a Stand user!

Six Bullets!

Giorno! Narancia! Be careful of the enemy!

His signal disappeared.

He's the only enemy in the area.

No one else is trying
to get near this plane.

Giorno! As you can see, he died instantly.

There's no need to check up on him.

Yes, I know, but we need to be cautious.

He went down surprisingly easily.

It's like he showed up only to be defeated.

Hey, are you mocking me and my Bullets?

It just means that he was no match for me!

He's obviously way weaker!

Yeah! Yeah!

He's completely dead.

Not only is he not breathing, but his
heartbeat and life energy are gone, too.

Mista! Giorno! We're taking off!
Hurry up and get on!

Come on, Giorno. Let's go.

I wonder if my father...

No, your boss

might have guessed that I'd go to
Sardinia to find out about the past.

Former.

Our former boss.

I'm sure the thought crossed his mind.

That's why we need to find out about
the boss's past as soon as possible.

I figure that when he met
your mother in Sardinia,

he wasn't a gangster who
needed to hide his identity yet.

He was just an ordinary young man.

He became a gangster after that.

He must have some kind of identity.

The true identity of the boss from
fifteen years ago surely exists.

As his daughter, you should
be able to track it down.

Something, anything...

Do you remember anything more detailed
from your mother's stories of the past?

Cala di Volpe.

Cala di Volpe... The fox's tail?

It's a resort located in a beautiful,
emerald green coastal area.

My mother mentioned that she met
my father there while on vacation.

She also mentioned that my
father grew up in Sardinia.

Apparently, he spoke with
a Sardinian dialect.

But then he disappeared, and my mother
never found out more than that...

Not even his name.

I'm not even sure what I should look for.

Besides, this is all just from
my mother's reminiscing.

You're the boss's only living relative.

That's why he's trying to eliminate you.

Cala di Volpe...

That means we have our destination.

Mista.

Get your gun out and take aim.

Listen to this sound...

Sound? You mean the sound of the engine?

What are you talking about?

Just please, get your gun out.
There's something weird about this cabinet.

Hey, hey, hey, hey...

The only one being weird is you.

You're the one who said there wasn't
so much as a cockroach on this plane.

That's true... I don't feel
any life energy, even now.

But...

But what?

Are you trying to say there's a
remote-controlled Stand on the plane?

You sure you're not just freaking out?

I could very well just be freaking out.

But I know I heard something.

I have a bad feeling about this.

I'm going to open this.
Please have your gun ready.

A freezer...

I-I apologize. I was getting
a little too high-strung.

Giorno, what the hell kind of joke is this?

When did you put that in there?

You're trying to scare
me with chicken scraps?

What the hell's so funny about that?

Th-That's not chicken.

It's still wet. Th-The blood's still fresh.

Aren't these the fingers of the fatty
I blasted back at the airport?

Giorno, am I wrong?

Calm down, Mista.

Hey... Is there another one now?

You two. Is something wrong?

Giorno, you confirmed that there weren't
any signs of life on this plane.

But Mista is saying that it looked like
those fingers increased from three to four.

Is there any life energy in those fingers?

They are just bones. They have no life.

If these bones had any signs
of life or were a Stand,

plant life from Golden Wind's
powers wouldn't grow from them.

It freaked me out because it
looked like there was one more,

so I could've just been seeing things...

But there's still something
really off about this!

Indeed.

I'm not sure how or why, but someone
put these in here on purpose.

Let's throw these outside.

Huh?! But opening the door is super dangerous!

Apparently, the difference in air pressure
would send us flying like some rat in a toilet!

Everyone, hang on to something.

Zipper Man!

Pop

Guess you didn't need to hang on after all.

Anything else out of the ordinary?

Check every inch of this plane.

I want some pizza, too.

I want to go back to Naples and
enjoy a simple Margherita...

This jet looks like a train station bathroom.

But it must be some rich guy's jet...

What the hell is this?

The enemy Stand's name is...

Notorious Chase.

Who wrote all this, and when?

Who the hell wrote this?!

What?!

Th-These fingers...

I-It can't be! We threw
the finger bones outside!

We didn't even touch them!

Is this what made that graffiti?

A corpse?

B-But this can't be...
The Stand ability of someone who's dead?

Is this thing getting bigger
by consuming my body?

Golden Wind!

Cut off my right arm!

What?!

It's consuming my arm in the same shape.

My Stand... is being consumed!

The one who was scribbling
on the wall was me...

The one who brought the fingers
onto the plane... was me!

What's going on, Giorno?

H-Hey...

Golden Wind!

You should probably make a
new right arm fast, Giorno.

Was he trying to jump onto Golden
Wind's right arm just now?

What's going on, Giorno?
This is unthinkable!

We've never dealt with a
Stand like this before.

It goes against all we know.

A Stand... Does that mean the
user is hiding somewhere?

The user isn't here.

He's already dead. He died on the runway.

That man came here specifically to die...

so that his Stand could
automatically trace us.

Its energy is still alive.

It appears to be a Stand that only
activates when its user has died.

There's no user, so it can keep
up with this jet's speed.

But it's super slow, Giorno.

Actually, it's not moving at all. Did it die?

It's not moving?

No, Narancia...

It's eating, so it doesn't
have to move right now.

I got too close. This thing is fast.

My bullets...

It got four of them just now...
That's more than half.

Number Two! Three! Six! Seven!

This thing's seriously bad news!

Don't get too close.

Everyone, stay back.

Mista!

Shit! Don't get close to it!

For some reason, it changed
its target to Narancia.

It's using some criteria
to decide who to attack.

How dare you underestimate me?!

I just need to stay away from it, right?

But...

My L'il Bomber can blow this thing
apart without getting close at all!

That movement...
It's definitely tracking something.

I-Impossible! It's fast! It's way too fast!

This isn't good! At this rate,
it's going to attack all of us!

N-Narancia!

Trish! Hide inside the closet!

What?!

Why is it going after Trish?!

Hurry up and shut the door!

I-I won't make it in time!

Trish!

Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!
Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless! Useless!

I figured out...

what it's tracking.

It's movement!

This Stand reacts to movement and
prioritizes attacking whatever moves!

It matches the speed of the
fastest target and prioritizes it.

If we can get this thing off the
plane along with my left arm,

we'll get to Sardinia safely.

Then everything will go as planned.

Giorno, wait!

Who's going to heal your wounds
if you lose both your arms?

Swap with me! Get that Stand onto me!

We won't make it in time, Bucciarati!

It's climbing up higher!

D-Don't!

Giorno!

How can this be?

We haven't even gotten to Sardinia yet,

Mista!

and both Mista and Narancia are...

How can this be?

If we weren't in an enclosed space like this,

they might not have been so badly injured.

My idea to board a plane was naïve...

No one could've predicted this.

And it's because we're on a plane

that we were able to blow that Stand away.

Regardless, we have to tend to their wounds.

They're all gravely injured.

Let's get them inside the turtle.

Hang on a second.

Tend to their wounds... Their wounds...

Giorno's arms...

They can be healed, right?

With Golden Wind's powers...

Golden Wind and Zipper Man's powers activate
once their fists hit or touch something.

This is the most damage
we've endured so far.

Giorno Giovanna is no longer able to fight.

That probably goes for Mista
and Narancia, as well.

Giorno can't recreate the
arms that he's lost!

Trish, you should get some rest.

I'm going to go tell Abbacchio.

I'm...

heading to Sardinia for myself.

Just for my own safety...

And...

For my future, I want to
find the key to my father.

But Giorno and the others are different.

They're making decisions based on

what they think is right,
not for their future or safety.

I...

can't even begin to understand that.

Was that... a ball?

A ball was rolling around?

I-Impossible!

It didn't get blown away
by the plane's speed?

No, it's the opposite...

Giorno...

It's movement!

This Stand reacts to movement and
prioritizes attacking whatever moves!

In that case, the plane is
moving through the sky...

The faster something is,
the more it prioritizes catching it!

It attacked the knife just
now because I dropped it...

I want to run into the
closet and shut the door.

Slowly...

I have to move slowly...

I have to escape without any sudden movement.

I-It's so sensitive!

Why did it change direction?

It must've reacted to something.

That's... Giorno's brooch?

Could that brooch be...

alive?

Golden Wind... No, Giorno's arms...

H-His left hand?

C-Could it be forming his left hand?

Before Giorno cut off his arm, he used
Golden Wind to give the ladybug life

and created the hand he lost.

Giorno's not out of the game yet!

If I can protect that left hand,

Narancia and Mista's wounds can also be healed!

B-But how am I going to do that?!

Episodio 25
Spicy LadyThat's... Giorno's brooch?

C-Could that brooch be...

forming his left hand?

Giorno's not out of the game yet!

If I can protect that left hand,

Narancia and Mista's wounds
can also be healed!

B-But how am I going to do that?!

Episodio 25 Spicy Lady

B-But if I scream

or move faster than that
brooch, I'll be killed first.

It's unfortunate for Giorno and the
others, but I can't do anything...

And I'll also be the one
attacked after the brooch.

I have to hide.

I have to use this opportunity
to hide in the closet...

This is...

the switch to make the seat recline.

If I push it, the seat will lean back.

That thing will probably attack
this seat before the brooch.

Th-Then I can grab the brooch
and head into the cockpit...

B-But I can't!

I can't make a wager like that!

It's far too dangerous.

I need to just hide in the closet...

What's wrong with me?!

Do I even realize what I'm doing?!

Unbelievable.

I didn't want to take the risk,
but I still pushed the button!

Now I just have to do it.

The path to the cockpit is wide open!

Move...

slowly...

Just like the tai chi that
the Chinese practice...

It's only about two meters to the brooch.

I can't rush.

If I rush, I'll die!

It's heading back this way!

Because it finished destroying the
seat... and it stopped reclining...

But there are more seats to recline.

Why did it... grab on to
my leg and not the seat?

L-Liquid?

It reacted to the speed of
these liquid drops falling?

B-But why are my boots wet?

All I did was push the reclining switch!

How did my boots get wet?

I knew it. I should've left the ladybug alone.

I should've just stayed out of this!

S-Save me, Bucciarati!

M-My boot just fell over next to my foot.

It's like it went through my foot...

Wait, what?

What just happened?

Now, pick up that brooch, Trish.

Wh-Who's there?

Is someone there?

I've always been here,

ever since you were little.

I've always been by your side.

Trish, please pick up that brooch.

That's the decision you've made.

You've already made up your mind
to protect Giorno's left hand.

Hesitation leads to weakness.

And... please, give me orders.

Wh-Who are you?

I am you.

I'm also the one who got the
thing off of your boot just now.

I am your ability.

Now, if you've made your
decision, please pick it up.

You and I are going to protect

Giorno's left hand!

Trish, if we're able to protect it,

we'll open up a new future
for Giorno and everyone else.

And your future, as well.

What's going on?!

Pick it up, Trish!

I'm finished!

How the heck am I supposed
to protect this thing?!

This is your ability.

I made the seat softer.

Wh-What just...

Made it softer?

I literally slipped right through the seat.

And it somehow damaged that thing.

The fleshy part of that thing ripped.

That thing managed to stop Mista's
bullets and catch up to this plane.

It has the ability to destroy
things that are fast.

But if it hits things that aren't
moving, it takes damage.

Are you... me?

Was I the one who just did this?

The thing with the boot, too. Was that—

What's important right now, Trish,

is that you picked up the brooch.

Your strong determination
overpowered any hesitation.

You are becoming stronger,
both mentally and as a person.

And you are able to make anything
in this world softer, more elastic.

Making things softer...

means they become harder
to break than diamonds!

I-It's coming again!

This time, stay still.

I'm starting to understand that
you're me, but I have to hide!

Make the closet door soft!

Please make it in time!

Damn it! Stay the hell away
until I close this door!

I-It managed to find me on the other side
of the door, even though I'm hiding!

I-I'm done for!

I'm starting to understand that I'm a
Stand user and have Stand abilities...

B-But...

This thing's invincible!

The user is already dead, too.
No one can defeat this thing!

Trish, I asked you not to move.

We have to head to the cockpit,
where Bucciarati is,

but we went in the opposite direction.

What are you talking about?

Giorno's brooch is developing
into his left hand and moving.

I had to run away!

But your ability...

All it does is make things softer!

It's taking all I have
to evade these attacks!

I-It's going to get me!

I-It attacked the clock again?

What?

I made the clock more elastic.

As long as you don't move faster than
the second hand on that clock,

it'll continue to respond to the second hand

and give priority to attacking
the clock over and over.

When I said not to move,
I just meant to move slowly.

Move slowly.

Slower than the second hand.

At super slow speed...

But with the strength of a vise.

We're going to rip this thing apart...

and kill it.

You bastard! Just go to hell already!

You piece of shit! Quit latching
on to this world, damn it!

It's falling apart into tiny
pieces and disintegrating!

This Stand that just kept pursuing
its targets, like a vengeful spirit,

is becoming so small and disappearing...

Y-Your name...

Do you have a name?

What should I call you?

Spicy Lady.

I see...

That's a fitting name.

Trish Una

Spicy Lady

Now Mista and Narancia's
wounds can be healed.

But Giorno Giovanna...
He is a strange person.

Not only is he able to give things life,

but his actions also helped you mature.

I'm going to go make sure
the engines are okay.

Bucciarati, I have some news to break to you...

The problem has already been solved.
Giorno has actually already...

Don't say another word!

I-I mean... Slowly...

Come here slowly, Trish.

Our altitude is 7,000 meters!

6,800...

6,600!

It's no use. It just keeps falling!

And I don't know why!

I figured out why we're falling, Abbacchio.

But what are we supposed to do?

What are we supposed to do about this?

Bucciarati, what are you—

I told you not to move!

D-Don't tell me...

Th-Th-That's... But that's impossible!

Giorno said that thing has
the ability to catch up

to things that move and take them in.

The engines on this plane...
Just now, that thing...

Trish, don't turn around.

Don't panic, no matter what.

Slowly walk this way.

Th-That's...

No! Th-That's impossible!

It's no use! We just keep falling!

At this rate, we're going to crash!

Actually, the engines are
likely to explode before that!

Th-That thing should've been torn
into pieces and disintegrated...

W-Wait, the engines are
right behind the closet.

Oh, no...

If even a tiny part of this thing
melded into the wall of the closet...

There's a possibility that it
took in the engine's energy.

And now...

We need to make an emergency
landing, Abbacchio.

The Tyrrhenian Sea is in front of us.

We need to make an emergency
landing on the water.

It's the only choice we have!

An emergency landing?

Even if we're able to land safely,
what are we supposed to do after that?

This thing will still come after us!

It's invincible. It's too powerful.

It's an invincible ability!

Now, slowly, Trish...

Slowly, like a slug. Don't panic.

Don't run, whatever you do!

If you rush, it'll attack you!

Wh-What the?!

What are you doing?!
It's going to catch up to you!

Yes, it certainly will!

If I do something as lame as moving slow,
it's going to catch up to me anyway!

Get in the cockpit, Bucciarati!

Have you lost your mind, Trish?!

It's going to destroy the door!

Th-The door...

Th-This is...

What the... Don't tell me you...

An emergency landing?

Bucciarati, we need to do the opposite.

If we all want to survive
and get to Sardinia safely,

we need to... destroy this plane!

Wannabe!

Spicy Lady!

T-Trish... This is...
When did you obtain Stand abilities?

Th-The walls and glass
are all soft like rubber.

If that thing is going to
prioritize speed in its attacks,

then crashing would be faster.

A plane crashing is way faster

than this parachute!

Yes! You stupid bastard!

We took pretty severe damage,

but now that the plane has crashed
into the waters near Sardinia,

that means the boss's men can't
confirm whether we're dead or alive.

Right?

The organization's lost track of us.

That means we've got some time now.

Time to track down the boss's
true identity and find him!

No, Abbacchio.

It appears that our damage is going to
grow just a bit... just a little bit more.

I'll get rid of that thing.

I have to use my zipper.

Wh-What?!

Don't tell me...

It's completely invincible.

There's no way to kill this thing.

We can only chase it out with
speed, just like Giorno did.

B-Bucciarati, you can't mean... D-Don't do it!

You're going to wrap that
thing onto your arm?!

Don't! Are you going to take
yourself out of this, too?!

No, Abbacchio.

No one else is going to get hurt.

Giorno's Golden Wind ability

is safe right here.

Wh-When did you...

Arrivederci.

"Goodbye."

Stand name: Notorious Chase.

Complete annihilation: impossible.

Forced to track the crashing
waves of the sea forever.

At times, it attacks ships that happen to
move faster than the waves and sinks them.

Eventually, these waters would be known
to local fishermen as the "Tyrrhenian Belly"

and considered ominous.

Now, let's lay low and find
out who the boss really is.

We're going to track down my father's past!

The private jet hijacked from
the Marco Polo International Airport

crash-landed in the Tyrrhenian Sea,
fifty kilometers northeast of Sardinia.

This mystery has yet to be solved.

No passengers were found on board.

I thought I'd made it disappear,

but one's past wraps itself around
one's true peace, never letting go.

Unbelievable. This is why blood
relations are so troublesome.

It wouldn't be concerning
if it involved a stranger,

but once blood relations are
involved, things become tricky.

But that's all it is.

It's just a blood relation.
If I can get rid of that,

I'll be able to remain
in the prime of my life.

Several days ago,
after Pericolo secured Trish,

the traitors who were after her scoured this
apartment that Trish and her mother lived in,

but none of them noticed.

Every morning of her life,
Trish awoke in this house...

And...

Every day, she looked at this picture
that her mother had lovingly put up.

But this date... There's no doubt about it.

It's fifteen years ago.

This portrait... Even I almost missed it.

To think that such a thing existed...

Their plane crashed... but they're alive.

I can feel it...

My daughter's Stand abilities have awakened.

I can also tell that she's alive
and heading to Sardinia.

And if it was Abbacchio's Moody
Jazz that was flying the plane,

that means he's also alive, at the very least.

I can't let Moody Jazz go
to the spot in this picture.

Trish might not realize it right now,
but she'll surely remember

the existence of this picture.

And if she goes to Sardinia, she'll figure out

that the person who took this portrait
of her mother when she was young

was me!

I can't let Moody Jazz's ability replay that!

I'll have to go there myself.

I have to do it myself.

I can't let any of my subordinates
attempt to handle this.

Oh, y-you were home.

I knocked, but...
I'm here to clean your room.

P-Pardon me, I'll come back later...

Huh?

Huh?

Why was I here again?

O-Oh, right! To clean! I'm supposed to clean!

Now, time to get to work.

Episodio 26
A Little Story From the Past ~My Name Is Doppio~Episodio 26 A Little Story From the Past ~My Name Is Doppio~

This is a little story from the past.

Summer, 1965

We're going back to the summer of 1965.

Prisoner 696! What's going on here?!

Prisoner 696!

Did you eat something bad?

She's pregnant?

This is a women's prison on a remote island.

There are only women here!

Not to mention, this prisoner

was sentenced to ten years
for bank robbery and assault.

She's been here for two years already.

Push! Just a little bit more!

When could she have gotten pregnant?

She wasn't big earlier today.

And now...

Hey, you! Who the hell's this kid's father?!

He's... dead...

For over two years... now...

You can't be serious.

A barnacle growing in your knee
would be more believable than that.

Looks like the baby made it.

Yes... But something's strange.

The baby's eyes have been
open ever since he was born.

And he's not crying at all.

This goes without saying,
but we can't raise a baby here.

We'll find someone to take him.

Where are you from?

Sar...di...nia...

A priest at a small church
there took the child in.

Time passed, and the boy
became known as someone

rather cowardly and a bit slow.

June, 1985

Well, I'll be going now.
See you later, Mr. Frog.

Hey, watch it!

Oh, it's you.

Walk closer to the edge, you dumbass!

Don't you dare tell the priest about this.

Th-That was close...

But I'm glad you didn't get squished.

Do you like frogs?

I like frogs, too.

I hate bugs, though.

I also don't like guys who smell.

I hate everything that's not beautiful.

Are you from around here?

Y-Yeah...

Say, it's a bit hot out.
Want to get something to drink?

Well...

That's not a bad idea.

Then I want sparkling water.

Hard water from France.

I hope you're treating.

You want to become a sailor?

Yeah...

Well...

You're a simple man.

That's probably best for you.

Oh?

He walked all this way?

Good on him.

It might be a good idea to get him a car.

In order to build a garage next to his room,

the priest started digging
into the floor with a pick.

What's this?

A corpse?

No, it's...

As he carefully picked at the concrete...

The person he discovered was a woman.

It was the woman who gave birth
to the boy the priest took in.

Sh-She's alive...

She couldn't move nor talk,
but somehow, she was being kept alive.

How many years had it been?

The woman had no sense of time.

Hatred? Love?

Her heart was dark.

This hair color...

That night, the whole village burned,

with strong winds carrying
the fire to every single house.

No one knows how it started.

Seven people died, and others went missing.

On the list of the deceased were

the names of the priest
and the boy he'd taken in.

Olbia, Sardinia: Present Day

Why, you!

Hey, kid! Look out!

Shut up. I know.

There's a truck coming, right?

You bastard!

Where the hell do you think
you're walking, you dumbass?!

O-Ow...

Aw, man... Ow.

Guess I had the wrong idea.

Looks like you're down on your luck.
Having a bad day?

Or have you been having
a streak of bad luck?

I'd say so. I've had one problem after another.

Why not let me tell your fortune?

I'll make it cheap.

Huh? Nah, I'll pass...

Sardinia is your home, isn't it?

And it's been a while since you've
been back here, hasn't it?

I wouldn't call that fortunetelling.

You can tell I'm a traveler
just by looking at me.

Anyone could figure that out.

You're... living with a secret.

Light and shadow,
what's inside and what's out.

You could probably call
it two separate lives.

But you take advantage of that secret
and have an unyielding personality,

which has earned you nothing but victories.

What?

Oh, please forgive my rudeness.

There's something about your face that is
very intriguing to someone in my field.

Please, let me tell you your fortune.

I'll make it 20,000... no, 10,000 lire.

Everyone has their secrets.

That's a pretty broad statement.

You're looking for someone.

You're currently looking for
someone very important to you.

Seriously...

Everyone spends their
lives looking for someone.

A beautiful girlfriend or a good friend...

But I guess it's nice to
hear these things at times.

How do you go about doing it?

With that crystal ball?

No... I've already begun.

I can tell just by looking at the shape
of the mud splatter on your pants.

It's been said for thousands of years
that in Romani fortunetelling,

the best results come from looking at the
shape of something that formed coincidentally.

Because that is the symbol of fate.

Your daughter...

Yes.

The person you're looking
for is your daughter.

You came back to Sardinia to find the child
of the woman you left fifteen years ago...

Huh?

Huh? Er... Something's strange.

You're rather young...

I know what I just said,
but this is strange...

Whose child? Mine?

But you have one. I'm sure of it.

Let me see your palm!

Hey!

Please! My pride as a fortuneteller
is on the line here!

Let go of my hand... Don't touch me...
I won't ask for payment...
Actually, I'll pay you!

20,000... No, I'll pay you 100,000 lire!

Please!

You're friggin' annoying! Don't touch me!

What good would it do
for you to see it, huh?!

Considering you're about to die!

Your face... Your age...

It appears you're not a Stand user.

You have the wisdom to see people

for who they really are,
and you made that your business.

That was your greatest failing.

No one in this world is allowed
to know who I really am.

But I now know that you are indeed
an excellent fortuneteller.

Out of respect for that, I'll be sure to kill
you instantly so you don't feel any pain.

So answer my question...

This man's name is Risotto.

He's a traitor.

He is also looking for my daughter
and trying to find out my true identity.

I want you to tell me where he is right now.

Where he is?

I can't tell that much...

But I'm sure you'll encounter him soon.

He's here in Sardinia...

He is filled with vengeance,

and you will certainly encounter him here.

I see. Very well.

That's plenty.

I knew it!

I was right! Light and shadow,
what's inside and what's out.

Two personalities!

As long as you bear this secret, the death
of people will bring you good fortune,

and you will never lose your splendor!

What a beautiful palm!

I've never seen a hand like this before!

Huh? Something's wrong.
It suddenly looks strange.

The lifeline is totally different...

I see!

This is my own hand!
It changed before I even realized it!

Emperor Crimson.

You...

I'm so glad you weren't squished.

It's dangerous to be on the sidewalk.

Go on, shoo.

Be careful. Go on.

Huh?

Where to, sir?

Costa Smeralda, please.

You got it.

And now for our next story,

the investigations involving the site of
the crash off the Olbia coast in Sardinia.

However...

Driver, do you have a cell phone?

Mine broke...

No, I don't. Sorry.

I see...

C-Could you stop for a sec, driver?

I'll get out here! This is fine!

I'll get out here.

That's the building.

There's no doubt about it.

I just have to keep an eye out over there.

Costa Smeralda in Sardinia.

This area was forgotten by history
until about half a century ago,

when a certain millionaire from India was
enamored by the scenery of this coast,

where the winds and cliffs met,
and started living there.

Hey, wait a sec!

There seems to be an extra
digit on your meter...

So you actually think I rigged the meter

because I wanted more money?

Is that what you think? Huh?!

N-No... But 800,000 lire to get from
the city to here seems a bit...

I don't have that much.

Like hell a guy on vacation doesn't have money!

I know you hid some in your pocket earlier.

I saw you hide an envelope in your pants.

Don't—

Come on, let me see.

Don't touch me... I-I'm getting a headache...

See? I knew it.

You friggin' idiot!

Those who have seen what
they shouldn't have seen

don't need to exist in this world!

Y-You bastard...

Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

Hey... Did you just hear a phone ring?

Huh?

Where did it come from?

Hey! I asked you a question!

That phone's busted, so there's
no way it could've rung!

H-Hell if I know! What are you—

Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

There it is again! Where is it?

Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

Where is it?

Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

Hey, what the hell? You have a car phone!

Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

Hello? Yes, this is Doppio.

Boss... Yes, I just arrived.

It's the spot in the photo.

I just need to keep an eye
on this place, right?

Huh? The driver didn't see
what was in the envelope,

so I don't need to finish him off?

If I may interject, Boss,

I believe he saw the photo that
he wasn't supposed to see.

Right. I'm very sorry, Boss.

Yes, I'm about to start watching the building.

You're about to watch the building?

No, my Doppio.

Take a good look. Slowly... Naturally.

Don't do anything suspicious.

The one who's being watched...

is you, Doppio.

Th-That's Risotto! The traitor assassin!

He appeared just like
the fortuneteller said!

Apparently, due to the plane crash,

he came to notice the existence of this
photo of Sardinia that was at Trish's house.

We need to take care of him first.

Otherwise, he'll interfere
once Trish arrives.

I'll be the one to finish him off.

We need to get close to him without
him figuring out my true identity.

Risotto's ability is a
mystery to me, as well.

Draw him out about two meters away from you.

Then he'll definitely be within
Emperor Crimson's range.

You can do it.

I'm hanging up, my Doppio.

Yes, I understand, Boss.

Beep.

What's this? My head... It hurts.

O-Oh, yeah. I don't have time
to worry about a headache.

I just had a call from the boss.

My mission is to keep an eye
on that building and... uh...

What was it again?

Get closer?

Right! I have to get closer!

But to what?

I won't get closer to you.

Look over here.

Wh-What the?!

But I think I've seen him before...

Wh-Who is he again?

Move your hand.

Otherwise, I can't see your face.

I-I don't have any money!

B-Blood!

Why does this always happen to me?!

Maybe I just imagined it.

The ignorance and fear in his
expression are not an act.

If he was from Passione,
he wouldn't act like this.

Not to mention, he's more
unguarded than a baby.

He must be a civilian.

Please don't!

Stop fussing. I'm just
going to pick up my knife.

I don't care about you anymore.

I-I don't feel so good... My head hurts...

T-Two meters...

That's right.

There was just one thing you
did that seemed like an act.

When you fell,

you reflexively hid the envelope
so I wouldn't see it, didn't you?

It's right under your left shoe.

What are you hiding?

If I'm satisfied with what I see, I'll leave.

What is your deal?!

I-I don't have any money! Just let me go!

It wasn't murderous intent or hostility,
but your expression there seemed fake.

Stand up, move your left leg, and show me.

I told you to stand up! Stand up!

Oh, so it's just an envelope.

There's nothing in it.

Your trembling certainly isn't an act,

and I can tell you're a
coward who can't lie.

But now... I'm even more interested in you.

You're definitely a Stand user.

You heard that sound, too, didn't you?

Just now, you glanced over toward that sound.

That's the sound of scouting.

It's carefully scouting the area.

That sound and shape...

is Li'l Bomber!

They've finally made it here!

And who are you to show up to
such an important location?

It must mean that the
boss trusts you greatly.

But there is true fear in your heart.

You're a walking contradiction!

Shut your trap!

You're the one who's about
to be shaking in your boots!

I see.

Since you're running toward me,
you must be a close-ranged power type.

Your range is around two to three meters.

As long as I know that,
I know how I'll kill you.

What... the... M-My throat!

Th-These are...

actual razor blades?!

T-Two meters, damn it!

I'll shove these razor
blades right up your ass!

I told you, I know how I'll kill you.

Impossible! I'm not done yet, damn it!

H-He disappeared?

That's his... That's his assassin ability...

But how...

Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

There's a phone ringing somewhere!

Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

I can't believe it!

There just happens to be a
pay phone in a place like this!

Click!

Beep!

Hello?!

My Doppio...

Wh-Where are you, Boss?

Are you nearby?

If you are, please come quickly!

I cannot.

I cannot go there until you
get close enough to him.

Because everything will be over

if he happens to see me and
then manages to escape.

B-But—

You need to get closer. You need to
get within two meters of Risotto!

Boss! I don't know what his ability is!

He could attack me again at any second!

Doppio...

Oh, Doppio...

My adorable little Doppio...

Did you forget that I gave you a portion
of my Emperor Crimson's power?

Now is the time to use it!

Episodio 27
Emperor Crimson vs. MetallicDoppio...

Did you forget that I gave you a portion
of my Emperor Crimson's power?

Now is the time to use it!

You have Emperor Crimson's arms and Eulogy!

Calm down and look carefully for movements.

And then try to predict the future
movements that will occur around you.

Look carefully and predict the
future movements that will happen

Episodio 27 Emperor Crimson vs. Metallic

ten seconds from now.

B-Birds!

Birds went flying, just like what I saw!

B-Boss! I just saw him!

He was blended into the footage of ten
seconds from now that Eulogy showed me!

It looked like a person had blended
into the rocks in the background!

B-But I can't see him right now!

I can't tell where he is by looking directly!

That's Risotto.

He's somehow hiding his appearance.

Could it be...

He normally isn't visible, but you can
see him because you saw the future.

Look a few seconds into the future to
see how he's going to attack, Doppio!

Th-There he is!

H-He moved!

Wh-What?!

Th-This is awful, Boss!

In ten seconds, s-scissors are
going to c-come out of my throat!

Calm down, Doppio.

What you saw wasn't you dying.

Risotto is the assassin that no one
in the organization could find.

You should expect a little bit of damage.

You need to see how he's going to attack you

a few seconds in the future!

The fact that he gets close to me

means that it's definitely not
a remote-controlled Stand.

Th-This footage showing that there'll
be scissors inside my throat...

Does it mean this future
is unchangeable, Boss?!

Correct.

Now that you've seen that footage,
you're going to have to prepare yourself.

It's true that you're going to have
scissors shoved down your throat.

But see through it!

See through how he's going to attack you!

If you can see through his methods,
you'll find his weakness!

And then, get within two meters of him

and strike him with
Emperor Crimson's arm, Doppio!

Damn it!

There you are! Take this!

You're sloppy.

But then again, in all my
years of being an assassin,

you're the first one to ever land
a blow this close to my location.

How truly interesting.

How did you know?

I'm curious about your ability.

But still... you're going to die!

I-Impossible!

How did he get the scissors under my skin?

He hasn't laid a finger on me,
and I haven't opened my mouth.

H-His Stand hasn't even touched me...

But the scissors are opening on their own!

A-At this rate, he's going
to chop open my throat!

Stab!

I need to get them out!

Those movements...

I thought I'd be able to slice open his throat,

but it's as if he knew I was going
to place those scissors there.

He just put his hand to his
throat and defended himself.

There's something going on.

I need to be more careful...

so I can finish him off
completely in my next attempt.

God damn you!

Damn it... I couldn't tell.

The boss is going to be upset with me.

I still don't know how he's invisible.

B-But this damage...
I-I'm losing strength in my legs...

Th-That's—

What's the matter, Doppio?

Were you able to see his attack?

B-Boss!

You couldn't see it?

Then move away from there immediately.

Figure out exactly where he
is by having him chase you!

Y-You bastard!

I've made up my mind.

I'm definitely going to see
through him next time.

Damn it.

I'm going to get within two
meters of him, no matter what!

You just saw Emperor Crimson's
next footage, didn't you?

What did you see?

I'm asking you a question, Doppio!

What did you see?

My right foot, Boss.

For the next move, in a few seconds,

it's going to be scissors again.

It went flying off.

My foot is going to go flying off.

What did you say, Doppio?!

H-He's coming! I saw a glimpse of him!

Get away from there right now!

Why didn't you move immediately
after seeing the footage, Doppio?

Risotto Nero, the assassin.

While his movements are careful,
he's already made preparations to kill me.

I can't get my legs to move.

I'm not sure if I can run.

Razor blades, scissors...

He was preparing for me
to lose all this stamina!

Shit. Doppio won't be able to win now.

It's going to take me at least
ten seconds to come out.

This isn't good.

The damage he'd endure from losing
his foot would be less than ideal.

I need to minimize the damage somehow.

I'm telling you to move away from there now!

You're going to be killed!

But, Boss, if I may interject...

That's exactly why I shouldn't move.

I've used up my stamina.

That's why it's easier
to tell if I don't move.

All I've been thinking about is
where he was attacking me from

with the razor blades and scissors.

But I was going about it the wrong way!

There you are!

His ability...

is to use the iron within
a living creature to create

iron razor blades within their bodies!

The fact that this frog and I are
so worn out gave me the answer!

You use your Stand ability

to use the iron within a living
creature to create razor blades!

And given that the razor blades came out
of the frog before they came out of me...

That's the direction you
were approaching from!

Th-This bastard...

Looks like the prediction was correct.

Someone's foot went flying off.

And the mystery behind the enemy's form
is slowly becoming apparent, Boss.

Huh? Boss?

That's strange. I could've
sworn I was holding a phone...

Where did I drop it?

I mean, that's a frog...

Oh, there it is!

How the heck did I drop it down there?

It's underneath all these rocks,
and now it's covered in sand.

Oh, jeez. And I need to report
to the boss immediately, too...

D-Did it break?

Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

Yes!

As small as they make electronics these
days, I guess they're pretty sturdy!

Hello? Praise me, Boss.
He can't move anymore.

Impossible...

Well done, Doppio.

My Doppio...

Am I going to be the one to finish him off?

Or should I wait until you get here, Boss?

I want to make sure that Risotto
Nero is finished off for good.

I'll take care of him myself.

Get closer to him, Doppio.
Get within two meters of him...

And then, I'll go there.

Until then, get closer to him.

You got it! I'll get closer to him, Boss!

Inside the wound where
his foot was severed...

They're wriggling.

Risotto's Stand is inside his body!

You have precognitive powers, don't you?

You had a decent idea of what would
happen and how I would move.

Otherwise, there's no way you could've
predicted my position or my attack.

It's true that, at first, you were a beginner
who couldn't do anything on your own.

But... who are you right now?

Your personality is now
filled with confidence.

And what's that look on your face?

Those eyes don't belong to a young man.

It's as if there are two of you.

Shink

Could that be what's going on?

No, that's not it.

There's no doubt about it.

I'm much closer than I realize...

to the one I'm after right now!

Two years.

It's been two years since we were

basically pups who had been
collared, shaking in fear.

You're definitely something more
than what we've been looking for.

I'm certain of it.

I want to know what you are.

I want to see your true form.

I want to know what you are when
I kill you... no matter what!

Risotto Nero

Metallic

Solido Naso... That's probably
one of the boss's aliases.

Otherwise, he wouldn't hide
his daughter so quickly.

We came all the way here,
but it's just a waste of damn time.

Damn it.

But if we're able to get his daughter,

we might find out who the boss is!

Right, Bro?

We haven't been able to make a move

ever since what happened
to Sorbet and Gelato.

I wonder who's guarding his daughter.

Pericolo's not a Stand user,
so maybe it's Polpo.

Then maybe we should head
toward Naples and ask him.

Don't get ahead of yourselves.

It's times like these that you should
remain calm before doing anything.

I understand how you feel,

but you need to lock away what
happened to Sorbet and Gelato.

Failure equals death.

I'm excited, but...

The one who gets too excited in
this situation is the one who dies.

The foot I chopped off!

I was right. Risotto Nero...

I can now see your powers! Magnetism!

You're controlling your Stand at
that distance with magnetism!

You took control of the iron inside me

and made me spit out those
razor blades and scissors!

The way you make yourself disappear
is by covering yourself in iron powder

and camouflaging yourself to
match the scenery around you!

Correct.

You may have figured out what
Metallic is, but it's too late.

Because you are already complete.

Iron.

You can find iron anywhere in this world.

Of course, it's in sand,

as well as spring water and plants.

And of course, iron is also
found within humans, as well.

Stab Stab Stab

What are you doing, Doppio?

You predicted his movements!

I will not allow you to
receive further damage!

Th-This is... B-Boss!

You saw through my ability,
and my foot got chopped off.

But you are already complete.

There's nothing you can do about that.

Large amounts of iron can be found in

vegetables like spinach and meats like liver.

It's an important substance
that's within your bloodstream.

What happens when all the iron within
you leaves your body at once?

To put it simply, your blood turns a
horrible shade of yellow and you die.

The iron in your blood
captures the oxygen

that enters your body when you breathe,

and carries it throughout your body.

Without that, the precious oxygen doesn't
reach your fingertips or your brain.

Which means, now that you've
been robbed of so much iron,

despite how hard you're breathing,
oxygen isn't entering your body.

Your body is going to become
a corpse before you actually die.

Now, then...

I wonder what I should do next.

Should I wait until you croak, or...

We seem to be out of time anyway,

so should I just go over
there and finish you off?

B-Boss...

That's...

They're near the mansion!

It's Bucciarati!

He finally showed himself!

Narancia's also there, and...
Abbacchio's there, too!

What? Abbacchio's there?

We're out of time.

Doppio, finish him off with your next move!

Predict Risotto's movements in the footage!

I'm already looking!

Risotto will come around
my right side, and then...

He disappears! I can't see him!

I-It can't be...

What do you see, Doppio?

What do you see?

I'm gonna turn the tables, damn it!

I'll finish him off, Boss!

A few seconds before what happens
in this footage happens...

I'll blow off his head instead!

Just like I chopped off his foot earlier!

H-Here he comes!

Don't do anything else, Doppio!

There's nothing else you can do.

Listen well, Doppio. This is important.

Don't waste any more energy.

I'm heading there right now.

It'll be a few more seconds,
but I'll deal with Risotto.

A few seconds?!

But it'll be too late!
He's going to attack me any second!

Deal with it!

If my full abilities get there,

I can just erase the time
you saw in the footage!

But I'm the one who's going to be attacked!

So I'll finish him off!

Doppio! This is the only way!

This is the only way you're going to survive!

Your body can't take any more.

I won't allow you to waste any
more energy on my behalf!

You're going to finish him off?

Risotto Nero is not someone
you can find twice!

But what if I can, Boss?

If I know where he is...

If his ability is going to try to steal
even more iron from my body...

H-Here he comes! He's attacking!

He should have the strength to pull...

He should have the strength
to pull the iron from my body!

The scalpel is pointing in the
direction of the magnetic force!

You're right there, Risotto!

I figured that's what you'd do.

Magnetism pulls at the iron.

If you can figure out which
way it's being pulled,

you thought you could figure out my location.

However, unfortunately...

What you sensed was

the magnetism that Metallic is producing
in the foot you chopped off.

I left it there.

I learned from my mistake of
letting you chop off my right foot.

I need to make the best of that situation.

There's barely any oxygen left in your body.

You are complete.

You shouldn't even be able to move an inch.

You're different from before.

Now you're brimming with confidence.

The excessive physical changes to your body,

and the way you're talking to yourself...

It all makes sense now.

I finally figured out who you really are!

Yes, this had already been confirmed
in 16th century Germany.

There are people in this world
who have multiple personalities.

In some cases, it doesn't
just affect them mentally.

Their body... Their physique can change,
as well as their way of speaking.

I had just thought that you were the
boss's most trusted subordinate.

But you...

To think that you...

I can't wait.

I can't what to see what your
face will look like once you die!

There's nothing else you can do.

I'm keeping my distance.

You have no strength to resist.

There's nothing you can do!

I've won!

I'm going to chop off your head!

This is the end! Take this!

Metallic!

Wh-What?

Risotto,

I told Doppio...

that you were no longer
an enemy he could handle.

Don't tell me...

I knew it. The enemy was already here.

But I shot right through him!
I hit him good, too!

Y-You...

If the blood in my body
that's been robbed of iron

isn't going to carry oxygen
throughout my body...

It's the same thing as if
my body wasn't breathing.

Which means that the only thing
Li'l Bomber can track right now...

How many enemies are there, Narancia?

Just one!

There's only one person
breathing on that cliff!

...is your breathing, Risotto.

I see.

This is the same thing that happened in
the footage that Doppio saw, but...

I was winning...

I would've won...

But you had thrown the scalpels at them...

Boss...

Episodio 28
Beneath a Sky on the Verge of FallingEpisodio 28: Beneath a Sky on the Verge of Falling

Which means that the only thing
Li'l Bomber can track right now...

I was winning...

I would've won...

But you had thrown the scalpels at them...

Boss...

He's down! Li'l Bomber finished him off!

All right.

I'll go find out who it was.

Hold on, Abbacchio.

We don't know how many of the boss's
men are on this beach right now.

I need you to hurry

and replay the footage of the one
who took the photo of Trish's mother

on this beach fifteen years ago.

We need to get out of here as soon
as we can, or we'll be in danger.

But there's only one of them on the cliff!

Bucciarati, I remember the
Stand from the plane.

Despite Mista turning that guy into
a corpse, we still went through hell.

I have to confirm who's up on that
cliff, or I won't be able to relax.

Narancia, is the enemy up there dead?

He's barely hanging on.

But his breathing has just about ceased.

He hasn't moved a millimeter.

All right.

Narancia and I will be the
ones to go and check.

Abbacchio.

Use your Moody Jazz to get
the replay going right away.

All right.

We can't stay here for too long.

How much time do you need?

Well, we're talking fifteen years ago.

It'll probably take eight to ten minutes.

Do it in five.

Giorno, Trish, and Mista are standing by in
the turtle, so I'll bring them out here, too.

And the moment we learn the boss's
true identity from Moody Jazz's replay,

we'll leave here.

Narancia, use Li'l Bomber to signal for
Giorno and the others to get out here.

You got it!

I finally... figured it out...

I know... your identity...

Before I die...

show me... show me your face...

I will not allow you to continue this
conversation any longer, Risotto Nero.

The last thing I wanted was for Bucciarati
and his crew to find out we were here.

You should die with pride as the leader

of the Hitman Team,
since you made it this far.

I'm sure your men who are waiting in
the afterlife will be proud of you.

You're going to die at any second.

And Bucciarati will come find
you up here at any moment.

Before that happens, give me back
all the iron you stole from my body.

If you do, I'll finish you off myself.

Wouldn't it be the worst embarrassment
of your life if you were

to die slowly and miserably
in front of Bucciarati

and his men, who took the lives of your team?

Not to mention, they already
consider you a pathetic enemy.

I... die...

What was that? I couldn't hear you.

Hurry up and give me back the iron
that was in my body, Risotto Nero.

I'm saying... that I won't die alone.

Within the chunks of flesh
that Li'l Bomber blew off...

The parts of me that scattered...

This time, I'll be the one using it...

Li'l Bomber, that is!

Die!

What the heck? Li'l Bomber is...

That bastard stuck itself to my Li'l Bomber!

Foom

Emperor Crimson.

I blew away 0.5 seconds' worth of time.

Everything that was in this world
within that span disappeared,

and all that remains is what
happened after those 0.5 seconds.

Just the results of the bullets hitting you.

Rata tat tat tat tat tat

Well done, Risotto Nero.

You died before you could lose your pride.

But that also means I'm still facing
this unfortunate predicament.

This isn't good.

I have to do something...

Are you sure, Narancia?

Yeah.

Something made its way into Li'l Bomber!

Shit!

They're coming...

I have to hide... and somehow
replenish my iron...

Stop right here.

We need to assess the situation
carefully from here.

Got it.

It's all right, Bucciarati.

His breath's completely stopped,
and his Stand has disappeared.

He's definitely dead.

Though, I shot him in the face, so it
might be hard to tell who he actually was.

That man is probably the
leader of the Hitman Team.

How can you tell?

He's here alone without a team,
which means that either

he was a very confident killer
someone sent after us,

or he had no one left on his team.

And he was just killed by whoever
this other very confident killer was

for getting in the way.

Uh, hello? Bucciarati?

It was my Li'l Bomber that
turned him into a honeycomb—

You're wrong. You were just being used.

There was someone else here.

Look at his right foot.

Li'l Bomber's attacks would
have left burn marks.

But there are no burn marks on that foot.

It was only torn off.

But... there was only one person
on Li'l Bomber's radar!

I'm still not getting any other signal!

And why would anyone
need to do that, anyway?!

Neither of them likely expected

the other to be as powerful as themselves,
so the survivor is probably very badly wounded.

Though, I don't know how they're
hiding their breathing.

Narancia, you sent out a signal for Giorno
and the others to gather, didn't you?

They should be heading to the place
the picture came from right now.

All right, let's go after them.

From now on, don't overlook even
the smallest hint of breathing,

even if it's a lizard or a mouse.

The other killer is still nearby.

He's an extremely dangerous killer
sent by the organization.

Damn it...

To think I'd have to endure this hell

back home on Sardinia,

all because of those bastards...

I know this is a rocky area, but there
are way more than I expected.

When I'm tracking the breathing of
things like frogs and field mice,

there are just too many!

And if I make the range too sensitive,

I'll even pick up the breathing of the
tourists and the exhaust from their cars.

Damn it! Should I just light
this whole place up?!

Calm down!

Frogs and field mice will try
to hide in nearby holes.

Those aren't the movements
you're looking for.

Look for the movement of someone
trying to get away from us.

Movement of someone trying
to get away from us...

I have to hurry...

Abbacchio...

I have to stop his Stand!

That must be it.

Hey, where are Narancia and Bucciarati?

I only see Abbacchio on the beach.

An enemy must've appeared.

They're probably pursuing the enemy.

And it seems that Abbacchio
hasn't started his replay yet.

Trish remembered that the photo
was taken fifteen years ago in June,

but she doesn't know the exact date.

Moody Jazz is searching with
a timer for the exact time.

When it figures that out...

It'll be able to change into the boss.

Let's go.

Hey, let's play over here.

You're the goalie today.

What? No way!

Rock-paper-scissors, then!

Well? Can you tell them apart?

I found it, Bucciarati! There's just one!

It's 80 meters to our right.

That must be it. It's not very fast,

but it's headed toward the tourists!

Narancia, don't attack just yet!

First, we have to determine
exactly who we're dealing with.

His movement stopped.

Bucciarati?

Blood?

You, there! I'm about to attack you!

If you are unable to fight anymore,
come out from behind that rock.

I promise not to take your life.

I'll wait just three seconds. Got it?

It's been three seconds!

I take it you're prepared to fight!

Zipper Man!

Rip

Hey, come on!

Where the heck are you
kicking the ball? You suck!

Oh, come on!

It's your fault for not
being able to get it!

Just shut up and go get it already!

You go get it!

It's already the 25th.
June's going to be over soon.

How long is this gonna take?

It better actually be June
fifteen years ago, damn it.

Higher! Higher, damn it!

Throw some rocks at it!

Shake the branches! Climb up there!

Hey! Pipe down, you little brats!

Go play someplace where there's more room!

Duh, we know that.

Who the heck kicked it up there?

Hey! Stop throwing rocks!

Reach out your hand a little more!

I know, damn it!

I can't reach any further!

Oh, hell. Go on, move out of the way!

What the hell is this?!

Wait.

Don't attack, Narancia!

He's just a kid! He's one of the tourists!

His mouth is sewn shut with
the laces from his sneakers!

Only a Stand user could have done this.

They must've switched places with him.

And by the look of this kid,
he seems to have lost a lot of blood.

But where did all that blood go?

What the hell?! Where's the
bastard that did this to him?!

How the hell did he disappear?!

He was super weak a second ago!

I don't know...

What in the world is going on?

Thanks!

All right!

C'mon, let's hurry!

Thanks, mister!

Thanks!

Hey, wait up!

Thanks!

Nothing beats coming back home.

Luck's on my side.

Let's go!

Kick it right this time!

You're the one who kicked it over there!

I don't know what you're talking about.

Leone Abbacchio

Moody Jazz

Uh... What are you doing under there, officer?

Sorry to bother you while you're eating.

I'm conducting an investigation.

I'm looking for fingerprints.

There was a robbery across
the street last night.

The victim was struck with a bottle.

It shattered, and shards went everywhere.

But all the shards weren't on the sidewalk.

Particularly the part that was being held.

We heard that the suspect
threw something away here,

so I thought I might find
something in this recycling bin.

I should be able to get some fingerprints.

That's the part I'm looking for.

You're going to look through all that?

Well, it's my job.

I see.

Yeah...

Say, uh...

Yes?

For reference... I'm just curious.

What are you going to do if
you don't find the shards?

You might not get any fingerprints.

No... Even worse, if you do find them,

and the suspect hires a crafty
lawyer and is found not guilty...

What makes you keep working so
hard despite all those problems?

Well...

I'm not just after the result.

When all you want is the result,
you start to look for shortcuts.

And if you take that shortcut,
you might lose sight of the truth.

You'll become less motivated.

I think the most important thing
is the will to find the truth.

As long as you have that,

even if the suspect gets away this time,
you'll get them eventually, right?

Because that's what you're after.

Don't you think so?

I envy you.

I used to think I wanted
to become a police officer.

Ever since I was a kid,

I wanted to become a
distinguished police officer.

At some point, I even had
that same will you have.

But I messed up.

You see, people like me

are worthless.

We never see things to the end.

We always mess up somewhere along the way.

That's not true, Abbacchio.

You're doing great.

We have the same will.

That will you had when you
first became a police officer

resides within your heart again now...

Abbacchio.

Why...

do you know my name?

Come to think of it...

I think we've met before.

Where are you going, Abbacchio?

I'm getting on that bus!

I'm starting to remember...

That's right!

I have to go!

I need to get back to my comrades!

Did you forget, Abbacchio?

You came here on that bus.

This is the last stop.

You can never return.

Y-You're...

That's right! You're...

You're the one who died
because I took that bribe...

Abbacchio, you did very well.

That's right...

So well that I can say I'm proud of you.

No way...

This can't be happening!

God damn it! You can't be serious!

Hurry up and heal him, Giorno!

I said hurry up and heal him!

Don't make me kick your face in, you bastard!

It happened in a moment...

It happened in a second at close range.

We were too late...

We were too late.

How could someone like Abbacchio

let him get that close?

Mista...

Don't let Trish out of the turtle.

The enemy will probably attack
again, to try to finish Trish off.

We have to leave here immediately.

This is my fault.

We can't gather any more
clues about the boss here.

Wh-What are you talking about, Bucciarati?

Abbacchio is gonna wake up any second!

It's just taking a bit longer than usual!

He'll wake up if we just
wait a little longer!

Right, Giorno?!

That's what happened before, right?

H-Hey!

That's enough, Narancia!

It's too dangerous here!

You need to use Li'l Bomber
to survey the area.

What are you talking about, Bucciarati?

What the hell are you talking about?!

If the enemy's gonna show up,
I'll kill him right here, right now!

If he's nearby, I'll face him head-on!

Mista! Right, Giorno?

Hey, Mista!

We have to go, Narancia.

Just as Bucciarati said!

Wh-What?

What did you just say?!

Giorno!

You're probably just not trying hard enough!

Bring him back!

Give it all you have, you bastard!

That's enough, Narancia!

Shut the hell up!

Narancia!

Abbacchio...

Are we just going to leave
him here, Bucciarati?!

Are we just going to leave
Abbacchio all alone?!

I don't want to leave him behind!

This is an order, Narancia!

Abbacchio knew that this was a
possibility when he came here!

We're leaving.

Bucciarati, wait!

That's...

Bucciarati, wait. Just for a moment.

This must mean something. It has to.

He's holding something.

What is it?

It looks like a piece of rock from somewhere.

It must mean something. Golden Wind!

Go back to where you came from!

Hey, look!

Apparently, Abbacchio
had completed his replay!

This is a death mask!

A death mask from the replay!

Right before Abbacchio's
Moody Jazz disappeared...

It took the last of its Stand energy

and pressed its transformed
face into the stone pillar!

Abbacchio left us this at the very end!

This is the boss's true face!

Abbacchio, you did a great job.

And your will to get to your truth...

The ones left behind will get it.

Because that's what important.

Special Program
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Golden Wind
destinoAny luck?

Try checking Interpol or even
the Sardinian police records.

Do these fingerprints match any records?

It's no use. There are no hits.

Even if the boss had a previous record,
odds are he made sure it was erased.

But it has to be somewhere...

That's why he tried to eliminate

his own daughter and fears letting
anyone know what he looks like.

Why don't we look through
the records of the dead?

The boss might've faked his own death.

Let's give it a shot.

We can't let him get away with this.

A moment ago, just for a little while,
I felt the same thing I felt in Venice.

The one who got close to Abbacchio was...

my father.

This man finished Abbacchio
with his own hands.

Are you saying that the boss is here, Trish?

Yes.

I don't know where he is
right now, but he's nearby.

Bucciarati!

Not right now!

If we don't find out the
boss's identity for sure

and kill him, we're going to lose.

We have to track down his identity first!

No hits.

It's no use... The boss is meticulous.

It's impossible to track
him down any farther...

That's not true!

You have already tracked him down.

What?

All that's left now is to
find a way to defeat him.

Episodio 29 Get to the Roman Colosseum!

I've been waiting so long

for people like you, who'd do everything
they could to track this man down!

Screech

Someone tracked us down instead!

Giorno, cut the connection, quick!

Wait! Don't cut me off!

I'm on your side!

You want to defeat Diavolo, don't you?

Diavolo?

Please believe me.

I knew deep in my heart that someone who

wanted to defeat Diavolo
would eventually show up.

That's why I always kept this line open.

I've been waiting for so long...

I waited for years, filled with hope.

I'm on your side!

I don't know about that.

Diavolo?

Just because you said that name

doesn't guarantee that you're on our side.

Giorno, cut the connection.

His Stand is able to skip through time!

Did you know that?

Though I'm sure that

you're in a hurry to find out
who he is because you know that.

He's on our side...

This guy's on our side.

No underling of my father's could've
survived knowing his Stand ability.

Be quiet, Trish.

We can't reveal more
about ourselves just yet.

All right. Let's hear what you have to say.

First, tell us your name.

My name doesn't matter.

My body is already in a state
that prevents me from fighting.

What's important is whether or not
you are actually able to defeat him.

His ability to erase time has no weaknesses.

I'm sure you're planning
to assassinate him,

but you are certain to fail!

Are you saying you know of
a way to defeat the boss?

His Emperor Crimson is invincible!

But I do know of a slight
possibility to defeat him.

It's just a possibility, though.

You will have to obtain that possibility.

Obtain it?

Come to me. Come to Rome!

If you do that, I can give
you this possibility!

Do you really think we'll go to you?
We don't even know if we can trust you.

I'm sure at least some of
you know what this is.

Screech

That's...

the arrow!

At least, it looks just like it!

Why do you have that?

I'll tell you that later.

You must come to my
location to retrieve this.

He doesn't know the true
way to use this arrow.

This arrow doesn't just awaken
Stand abilities in people.

There is hidden wisdom within it.

I will tell you what it is.

Come to Rome.

This arrow will defeat him.

It is your last and only hope!

Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

Hey, you there!

What the heck do you think you're
doing, answering my phone?!

That call's for me!

Give it here! You stupid brat!

Hello? Yes, this is Doppio!

It's strange, Doppio.

What is, Boss?

Bucciarati and his crew.

They've lost Abbacchio, so they should
be at a loss as to what to do now.

But that's not the case.

They've fled with no hesitation whatsoever.

They're on that boat with a goal in mind.

Look into it.

Return to Abbacchio's last
location and look around.

Something's not right.

Look around?

But what am I supposed to look for?

Fear is born

from an unexpected past.

This is what I've been fearing

ever since I found out that I had a daughter.

There's nothing suspicious, boss.

The statue's been destroyed, but that it.

I know it. I can tell.

Those traitors... There's no doubt about it.

They figured something out
that I don't know about.

They figured something out?

What could it be?
They didn't have that kind of time.

It's something that I'd never expect!

That's enough, Doppio.

Go after them immediately.

You have to track them down yourself.

Yes, sir!

Also...

Cioccolata and Secco...

Have them stop Bucciarati and his crew.

I didn't want to ask for help from such
filth, but I have no other choice.

This is the last time.

Listen well, Doppio.
One must destroy their fear.

The moment is now.

We must get through this
right now, no matter what.

That is what it means to be alive.

Who the heck is this guy
waiting for us in Rome?

Can we really trust him?

Who knows? But Bucciarati
decided we're going.

What other options do we have?

Let me tell you a little
story from the past.

In Greenland, there's a place called
Cape York where only Inuit people live.

It's famous for having a crater
created by a meteorite.

It's said to have fallen tens
of thousands of years ago.

In 1978...

Two men from a team that was surveying
for natural resources within the crater

contracted an unknown illness.

They both ended up with blisters
all over their bodies,

and eventually, they died
looking like tomato sauce.

On top of that, one of them suddenly shot
a jolt like a stun gun from his finger

and accidentally burned a few
fingers off the doctor treating him.

In later investigations,
it was discovered that a virus,

which was tens of thousands of
years old, had been trapped

within the meteorite inside the crater.

That virus may have flown
here on the meteorite.

A virus?

What about it?

I tracked it down!

This arrow is made from the same material
as the meteorite found in Cape York!

Centuries ago, a man who craved
absolute power like that of the gods

found out about this rock and created
arrows from it. This is one of them.

This killer virus culls lifeforms.

This is a theory called "viral evolution."

Most people who contract this virus will die,

but some possess something
that lets them survive.

And as if it were rewarding them,

the virus gives them a new life ability.

This has already been proven,
with your own bodies.

So that's what Stands are...

That is the root and
principle of that arrow.

I see. I understand that now.

But what's this secret way of using the arrow

that we're supposed to retrieve?

I can't tell you that until
you come see me in Rome.

On top of that, I can only
tell one of you what it is.

Because no one else can ever find
out about this secret power.

But once you find out that method,

I guarantee that it will take
you to another dimension.

It is the only way to
defeat Emperor Crimson.

There's no guarantee that
your story is true.

But if the boss hears about this,
he's definitely going to eliminate you.

I'll trust you.

How do you want to meet?

Come to the Colosseum in Rome.

Once you get there, you'll know.

It doesn't matter what time.
I'll be waiting.

Everything will be revealed there.

Come on! Get up, damn it!

Shut up! I'm gonna take a piss!

Seriously!
I'm gonna do it!

This isn't the damn bathroom!

There's no toilet here!

This is it, right here.

Damn, that feels good!

I'm gonna do it!

Let's go up on land once those drunks leave.

Then we'll acquire a car immediately.

From there, we'll be in Rome
within 45 minutes.

All right, got it.

Perfect timing.

The moon's hidden behind the clouds, too.

Look, Mista.

There are some drunks
sleeping over there, too.

Damn it! Was there some
kind of party tonight or what?

Come on! You're gonna get in trouble.

Come here!

Let go of me!

I said I'm gonna do it,
so I'm gonna do it, damn it!

You can't! This isn't a bathroom!

See? It's right here.

Hey.

How the hell am I supposed
to reach like this?

How am I supposed to open my fly?

Wh-What the hell is that?!

Don't touch me!

Splash

What'is going on?!

That's a Stand attack!

What?!

They were waiting for us!
There's an enemy here!

Listen well, Secco.

The thing you have to worry about
most is running out of battery.

Finding out later that it didn't record
pisses me off more than anything else.

You sure it's recording?

Excellent.

Cioccolata, 34 years old. A former doctor.

About two years ago, he let a
patient die due to a simple mistake.

Once he was laid off from the
hospital, Passione took him in.

He could be considered a failed elite,

but the boss found out his true nature
after he became a Stand user.

It wasn't malpractice.

He had killed patients on purpose.

He diagnosed countless people
who were perfectly healthy

as being sick and operated on them.

He'd reduce the anesthesia so the patients
would wake up during surgery, as well.

Ever since he was a young boy,
he had always gotten top grades.

When he was fourteen, he volunteered
to take care of the elderly.

However, in reality, he was administering

unknown drugs to the
elderly people he looked after.

Also...

Your family hates you.

No one's going to come visit you.

He would say things like that every day,

driving people to suicide.

On his bookshelf at home,

he had 25 video tapes of the
expressions the elderly made

when he told them those things.

After driving nine elders to suicide,

he decided he'd become a doctor.

The thing that Cioccolata loved
most was to observe people dying.

The reason he became a doctor was so
he could observe people's pain and death.

While watching someone die,

he felt superior to the rest of humanity,

and felt as though he truly understood
the psychology of the human race.

Cioccolata's one and only partner was Secco.

The only thing known about him is that
he's Cioccolata's former patient.

For some reason, they got along,
and Secco only follows Cioccolata's orders.

Even among the various Stand
users that exist within Passione,

this duo stands out as a pair of monsters.

That's who Cioccolata and Secco are.

It appears that their
destination is Rome, boss.

I just received word that they
arrived at a local fishing village.

Listen well, Doppio.

Have Cioccolata stop and eliminate
Bucciarati and his crew.

But... you must catch up to
those two, no matter what.

Those two... yes.

It's rare that I ever feel repulsed by others,

but Cioccolata is the worst piece
of shit on the face of the earth.

He'll probably make a mess
of Rome before he's done.

So you think he'll go berserk?

That's why you're going to
catch up to them, Doppio.

You must take control in the end.

You must not let those two
find out what Trish knows,

nor what Bucciarati and his crew
are looking for in Rome.

You're the only one I can trust.

Do you understand? You're number one.

I understand, boss.

That is what I live for.

Sorry, was that call too long?

Thank you very much, little girl.

Um, hewwo?

What the hell is that, Mista?!
When did that get on you?

Rumble

I have no idea!

Just hurry and find the user, Narancia!

Find out where the enemy is!

Li'l Bomber!

This isn't good! There are a ton
of civilians already down!

The enemy's range is basically
the whole village!

They actually involved innocent people in this?

This is going to make
looking for the user...

Damn it! I can't tell them apart!

Explain the situation, Mista!

My hand just suddenly bubbled up.

I have no idea when this shit got on me.

It's almost like mold...
It's making my skin rip open...

It looks like it's coming out
from underneath my skin!

The same thing came out of the villagers,
and their bodies have fallen apart!

Th-This isn't good, Bucciarati!

We can't go up on shore.

There's no way we'll make it up
the stairs to the parking lot.

We're better off getting away
from the shore on the boat for now.

Are there any signs of
breathing on the shore?

There's no one on the shore!

Wait, Bucciarati!

Until we know what attacked,
it's too dangerous to move.

I know that if we go up on shore, we're gonna
be attacked by whatever this thing is!

Giorno!

Fwoosh!!

It's on me?!

This is...

Wh-Where the hell is it attacking from?!

M-Mista!

Grab on to me!

Mista! Don't stretch out your hand!

This Stand has something like a switch
that gives it the chance to attack!

Chance to attack?

What does that mean?

As soon as I lowered my hand,
the attack began!

Come to think of it,
it first bubbled up on my hand

after I reached into my boot to get my gun.

That drunk jumped down from
the stairs and got attacked.

Splash

The other one had gone down the stairs...

And Narancia had jumped down into the boat.

Fwoosh!!

Menacing

So the attack begins when our
bodies move down to a lower location?

B-But...

Menacing

Guuush

At this rate, you guys will be...

He's not going down.

He's not boarding the boat
to save the other one.

I guess he's already figured out...

exactly how...

my Green Tea works.

Mold...

I've read about this before...

There's a particular type of mold
that inhabits the inside of a bug.

When that bug moves to a lower location,
it propagates inside it and kills it.

Entomopathogenic fungus
and caterpillar fungus.

This is very similar to that!

If you move to a lower location from where
you originally were, it reacts and attacks!

This is a Stand!

Why in the world would it work like that?

To expand the Stand's range even further!

Just as the mold spreads
from within the dead bug,

the corpses produce more corpses.

If the people move a bit further before dying,
the mold's range just keeps growing.

That's exactly what they want.

Because the Stand ability is
the user's unconscious will.

Climb up, Narancia!

Get off the boat and back on shore!

Mista!

Hurry up! Move forward more!

My foot!

Throw the turtle, Narancia!
Throw it toward Mista!

Plop

Okay, Narancia.

That's perfect. That spot's just fine!

Bang

Bang

Bang

Bang

Bang

Bang

You and the turtle are in
the absolute perfect spot!

Booom

Yee-haw!

Well done, Mista!

As long as we move upward,
their attack won't begin.

They made it back up.

All of those bastards made it back onto the
shore without a single one of them dying.

Interesting.

Good. Excellent.

Episodio 30
Green Tea and Sanctuary, Part 1That's perfect. That spot's just fine!

Bang

Bang

Bang

Bang

Bang

Bang

Booom

Yee-haw!

Well done, Mista!

As long as we move upward,
their attack won't begin.

I see...

I think I understand how they survived
so long after betraying the boss.

You got the footage, didn't you, Secco?

The desperate looks on their faces as
they were fighting for their lives?

Good!

Good, good, good, good, good, good,
good, good, good, good, good...

Well done, Secco!

The more curious someone is,
the stronger they become mentally.

Humans are far more curious than any other
creature, and that's why they evolved.

I can't wait to see it...

I can't wait to see guys like him die.

Oh, right. Forgive me, I'd forgotten.

You get a treat for taking
such a good picture.

How does two sound?

Three, you say? You want three sweet ones?

You little glutton.

All right. You can have three.

Here it comes, Secco. Here comes three!

Oh, my bad.

Good!

Good, good, good, good, good, good,
good, good, good, good, good...

You're such a good boy, Secco!

Now, go!

You go to Bucciarati and the others, Secco.

You and your Stand, Sanctuary.

Episodio 30 Green Tea and Sanctuary, Part 1

What are we going to do, Bucciarati?

We can't go back out to sea.

If that mold's range is extended by
the corpses, as Giorno guessed,

then instead of tracking down the user,

we're better off finding a car and
getting out of this village.

Our number one priority
right now is to get to Rome.

Giorno, how's Narancia's treatment going?

It's hard to treat him in this village.

There's living mold in his wounds.

All right, Mista, climbing up is fine.

We're going to go up those
stairs and get ourselves a car.

That's a bit cruel, Bucciarati.

He didn't even ask Narancia
if he was okay or not.

Not to mention, earlier,

when you were trying desperately
to get up from the boat,

what did he say?

He coldly ordered you to throw the turtle.

What are you so mad about?

Of course he said that. I was the
one who went down into the boat.

It's good that we made it out alive,
but because of me, we almost died.

Besides, if Bucciarati hadn't
told me to throw the turtle,

I might've dropped it into the ocean.

I know that!

What I'm saying is that
he's cold to everyone!

Say... I don't really understand
how girls feel, but...

Were you hoping he would
ask you if you were okay?

I already know how Bucciarati is,

but you're dying to know more about him.

Excuse me? I'm dying to what?

Well, getting to Rome is what's
most important right now.

You can figure out your feelings later.

I'm really not doing so great right now.

Let me rest for a bit.

The only way we can go is up right now,

but if we should ever have to go
down any lower than where we are...

We'll be fine.

This village is built on
the side of a mountain.

All the roads are uphill.

And outside the village,
there are cars still running.

That means the mold's
range hasn't expanded yet.

We just need to acquire a car and
get out of this village quickly.

We need to hurry to Rome at all costs.

Which car should we take?

One with a corpse next to it, because that
corpse should have the key to that car.

It was just the mold breaking
that corpse's hand apart.

I'll watch our rear.

You hurry up and get a car.

Right.

Mista, I take that back.

Something... Something is wrong.

Hurry and go up!

R-Right!

What are you doing, Mista?!
I told you to go up!

I already am, Bucciarati!

But...

We're sinking!

We're moving away from the wall!

What's going on?

The whole staircase is being
pulled into the ground!

This must be a different Stand
user than the one using the mold!

There's another one after us!

This isn't good!
We need to hurry and climb up!

If we go down any further,
the mold will attack us!

Jump onto the wall!

My gun!

It's not sinking...

The staircase itself is sinking
into the ground, like it's melting!

What's that?

The enemy!

The enemy's down below,
and he's coming for us!

Mista! Climb onto the wall!

Zipper Man!

Zuboom

He's fast... This guy is fast.

And this is strange...

The ground feels solid when I'm
touching it with Zipper Man's hands.

This is a solid stone staircase,
but I'm sinking into it...

And this thing is moving around
freely underneath the hard ground.

This isn't good! I can't tell where he is!

Where is he coming from?

Can you hear me, Six Bullets?!

Come back to me!

Yee-haw!

One coming at us from beneath the ground,

and a man-eating mold Stand...

They're both making the most
of the other's Stand ability.

This duo is too compatible, more so than
any other team we've encountered before.

What are they, bound by the
red thread of fate? Damn it!

I found one, Bucciarati.

A corpse that's still holding the car key.

You bastard!

I just caught a glimpse of our enemy!

He jumped from the stairs
and dove into the wall!

Th-This is...

Run, Mista!

It's fast! At this rate,
we might make it to the car,

but we won't have time to start the engine!

I'll hold them back! Keep going!

Don't stop, Mista!
The ground is still hard!

The bullets are going to ricochet!

If the sinking ground is
still hard somehow,

our best chance is the
moment I get pulled under.

This guy's the powerful, close-range type.

His range is small.

I should be able to see it as
soon as it tries to pull me in.

That's when I'll get him!

There! It showed itself!

Now!

Take this!

Mista!

I see...

I figured a powerful, close-range type
might be able to deflect some bullets.

But you see...

If you're going to deflect bullets,
my Bullets can do that, too!

The first three shots I fired should...

What?!

He's not going to finish me off?

So he thinks he can kill me at
any time, now that I'm hurt?

Hurry and pick up the key, Bucciarati!

Start the engine!

What the hell are you doing?!
Hurry up and get in the car!

If we can actually get out of
this village by car, that's fine.

As long as we can all head for Rome.

Where are you going, Bucciarati?!

Wh-What?!

So you're going to track us from
underground, no matter where we go?

What a terrifying ability.

But do you have any idea where I'm headed?

Apparently you didn't, huh?
You had no idea where we were.

Arri, arri, arri, arri, arri...

Arrivederci!

Squish

Cioccolata

Green Tea

Arri, arri, arri, arri, arri...

Arrivederci!

My...

My...

My face!

What?

Cioccolata!

Three days ago... You heard, right?

The Stand that the boss sent into
the airplane... Notorious Chase...

Hey, Secco. Aren't you tracking
them down right now?

Why are you calling me?

Hey, Cioccolata... This is important.
Very important!

Chase... Is that thing...

Is it alive? Or is it a dead Stand?

What brought this on?

It's a simple question!

Answer me. If Chase was here,

would your Green Tea's mold
grow on it? On the dead Stand?

Notorious Chase...

Are you talking about the one where
the user was killed, but his hatred

was so strong that the
Stand somehow survived?

Who knows?

I'm curious about him, but I have no
idea if the mold would grow on him.

But I do know for certain that my Green
Tea will destroy any living creature.

The mold doesn't grow on inanimate
objects like rocks, right?

Forget about that! Quit wasting time
and film those guys dying already!

That's just it, though, Cioccolata!

Look up the hill. Look at the road.

Hey, Secco...

Why is there a car leaving the village?

Is the one driving the car one of them?

Why did you just let them go?

Hey, Cioccolata... It's just unbelievable...

He hit me in the face.

That Bucciarati guy...
He didn't have any mold growing on him.

Even though he jumped down!

I can't believe he attacked me there...

It's totally unbelievable!

His body won't grow mold!
What the hell is going on?!

I haven't the slightest.

I totally thought...

that you had plummeted.

You scared me, Bucciarati.

Did you hang on to the wall with zippers?

I guess it might've been a close call.

It doesn't look like the mold got you at all.

Mista, rest for a bit.

I closed your wounds, but if you move
now, they'll start bleeding again.

I'll look out for any cars
that might be following us.

Right...

Bucciarati, your wrist... Did you hurt it?

Please, let me see it.

Are you listening, Bucciarati?

If the mold got to you, you're in danger.

Please, let me see it.

That's...

Th-That's impossible...

Your skin is so cold...

A-And your pulse...

Giorno, did you just say something to me?

I couldn't hear you.

What's... going on?

Impossible...

It simply can't be!

O-Oh, yeah...
Something similar happened before.

I thought it was just my
imagination back then...

When we were leaving Venice.

Apparently, I hurt myself.

Looks like there isn't much time left.

I'm losing more and more
feeling in my skin...

Or...

Maybe I never had any to begin with.

That's impossible! Don't tell me, back then...

When you saved Trish from the boss in Venice...

Bucciarati, don't tell me... back then...

It's strange.

I've accepted this as fate.

Just a tiny bit of fate, of chance,
that Heaven had granted me.

When you healed my wounds in Venice,

it appears the life force you gave me

allowed me to move for just a bit longer.

Why... Why didn't you say anything?

My Golden Wind completely
healed your wounds back then!

I'm sure it can fix whatever
you're going through now, too!

Giorno, I'm sure your Golden Wind

knows more about that than anyone else.

That nothing can be done for those
whose lives have already ended.

By that time,

my life...

had already ended.

You won't tell the others about this, right?

That's impossible...
But that's impossible, Bucciarati!

Y-You're—

Quiet, Giorno!

Listen. What's that sound?
Am I just hearing things?

There's no car following us.

I hear it. It's getting closer.

It's getting really close!

What?!

Above us! It's a helicopter!

He dropped some mold on us!

Wh-What the hell just happened?!

Bucciarati, we're descending!
This road goes downhill!

The mold is going to get us!

Giorno, Mista! We're jumping out!

Grab on to me!

Climb up! Climb up, even if only a little bit!

Subconscious...

In a way, Stand abilities are
the users' subconscious abilities...

If there's any guilt in their heart,

they might subconsciously hit the brakes...

But whoever this is enjoys cruelty.

Actually, he lives for it.

That's how his ability became this.

This guy doesn't have any brakes at all!

He has no limits on how evil he can be!

Hey, what's wrong?!
I-I'll go get a doctor right away!

Hey, don't! Don't go down that way!

I'll bring a doctor here right away!

Hey, what's going on?

The mold...

It's spreading instantaneously!

That's impossible. There are
three million people living in Rome.

This is nothing like that fishing village!

And there are members of
the organization in Rome.

This would be a hit to the boss, too.

This guy doesn't care.

He's enjoying this!

At this rate, everyone in Rome will die!

No, this guy's not going to stop,
even if it spreads further than that!

There's something else!

At this rate, the mold's killing range
will spread to the Colosseum

faster than we can get there.

Mista! Is that helicopter
within your gun's range?

It doesn't matter!
We have to hit it, no matter what!

Make sure you take it down!

Got it! I won't let you get away!

Go, Six Bullets!

Yee-haw!

The guy in the helicopter
wanted me to shoot at it...

So that the guy who can move around
underground could safely get to us!

All right, Secco was able to splash
down safely... or should I say land?

Now they're cornered.

And whoever Bucciarati and
his men were meeting in Rome

will be dealt with by Green Tea.

Th-That bastard's coming
from the top of the hill!

And we can't go back down!

Mista, concentrate on the helicopter!

We can't let it escape!

I'll deal with this guy.

I-It's no use, Bucciarati!
It's already too far away!

I won't be able to hit the fuel
tank or the propellers from here!

No, Mista.

You never know until you try!

It's no use! They won't reach!

I know the Bullets' range better than anyone.

The helicopter got away!

The guy underground is coming for us!

The bullets hit their target, Mista.

Now, the two of us are going to go take
care of the man in the helicopter.

Let's go after the helicopter!

Go after it? The helicopter?

What?! What is this?

We have to take care of him before the
mold's killing spree reaches the Colosseum!

Bucciarati,

we can leave the guy beneath
the ground to you, right?

Go, Giorno!

Run, Mista!

Episodio 30
Green Tea and Sanctuary, Part 2By that time,

my life...

had already ended.

What?!

Above us! It's a helicopter!

Now they're cornered.

And whoever Bucciarati and
his men were meeting in Rome

will be dealt with by Green Tea.

We have to take care of him before the
mold's killing spree reaches the Colosseum!

Bucciarati,

we can leave the guy beneath
the ground to you, right?

Go, Giorno!

Run, Mista!

All right! Let's go, Giorno!

Either way...

I'm taking care of you first...

Buccia... rati...

Episodio 31 Green Tea and Sanctuary, Part 2

Bucciarati...

How dare you ambush
me back at that village...

I'm never falling for that again.

How dare you do something so cleaver?!

No, wait...

Something so lever... no wait.

Something so beaver...
wait, or was it sever? Griever?

You mean "clever"?

I knew that, damn it!
What are you, a language teacher?!

Y-Y-You jerk!

Oh, yeah. I need to record a video.

It shouldn't take me too
long to take care of you.

Let's see...

Zipper Man!

H-He's... His power and speed...

I-If we're doing this one-on-one...

I don't even need to dive into the ground.

Th-This ability...

It surpasses my Zipper Man...

both in speed and in power!

It's recoil. He's hitting
the ground with his elbows.

He's using the ground to give him elasticity

and increasing his power with that recoil.

That's why he's fast!

Just like a boxer using the ring ropes
to increase the power of his punches!

Sanctuary!

Take this! I'm out of time!

As I thought... There's
no mold growing on you,

even though you fell.

Cioccolata's Green Tea will
kill any living creature.

What the hell's going on with your body?

I mean, I guess I'll just have to pulverize

every last inch of your body
until you can't move anymore...

w-w-with my Sanctuary!

Giorno Giovanna!

I heard that he's a newbie.

He has the ability to give objects life.

The bullets that missed...

The plant that has a hold on this
helicopter must be his plant!

They're coming.

How dare they underestimate me?

Your life force energy is
no match for my Green Tea!

I'll rot all of these vines!

We're making this helicopter
take off, Green Tea!

Spread your mold!
We're breaking free of these vines!

Wh-What?!

I can't take off!

It's not moving at all!

Th-That's not good!

Okay, looks like it's grown to its full size.

It's turned into a tree!
Now that helicopter is secured.

Mista! We're gonna climb up the
tree to get to the helicopter!

There's no need, Giorno.

It's well within range of my bullets.

Yee-haw!

Go, Bullets!

Your target is his head!

What?!

Mista! The others are saying they can't
find him anywhere in the helicopter!

Where is he?! What the hell?!

There's no way he can hide!

He can't get out, either!

Everyone, look for him! Find hi—

Number Two! Number Three!

N-Not good! Mista, hurry and
call everyone back! Hurry—

Mista!

Number Two! Number Three!
What happened to you guys?!

Th-That's impossible!

Why isn't he here?

Each Stand should only have one ability!

His ability is to attack you
with mold if you drop down to

a lower position than
where you currently stand.

That should be the only one!

Run, Number One...

Number Six! Seven!

We can't... defeat him...

Hurry up and get out of this helicopter!

He's—

...too dangerous!

Mista! Hurry up and call the Bullets back!

Undo your Stand ability!

I can't... I can't call them back...

He got the Bullets...

I-I underestimated him...

Mista!

Mista! Send me over there!

I'll go bring everyone back!

No, it's no use, Number Five.

He's captured the Bullets
that he's destroyed,

because he knows Mista won't be able
to heal unless he gets his Stand back.

I can't heal him.

N-No...

And he's probably waiting for you to come.

If he manages to destroy you,
the final Bullet, Mista will die.

He's someone we should've faced head-on!

Mista! I'm leaving Trish and Narancia here.

Right...

Watch over them!

Mista! Mista...

Follow him... Number Five.

Back Giorno up...

Take this bullet.

Okay...

I feel a life force...

Why couldn't the Bullets find him?

I don't know his exact location,
but he didn't leave the helicopter.

In that case...

Golden Wind!

There's no effect?

What is he doing?

How is he hiding in there?

Medical supplies?

He's a doctor?

The aftermath of the mold...

It's spreading to the Colosseum!

There's no more time! I have to defeat
him immediately or all will be lost!

Th-The enemy's true identity is...

Come over here, Number One!

Don't go any closer, Giorno! It's a trap!

Useless!

What?!

Wh-What the hell is that thing?

Giorno, be caref—

Giorno!

Curiosity...

is the most important
factor for mental growth.

I've never been so grateful

as I am right now for all the experimentation
that was conducted on me as a child.

I made very close observations
on what parts of the human body

I could sever and still keep that body alive...

Of course, I'm quite aware of which veins

need to be closed off to
prevent bleeding out, too.

And if I cover the parts that
I sever with Green Tea's mold,

I can continue moving around,

despite being in pieces,
and hide wherever I need to.

You can't fall, Giorno!

If you fall any further,
the mold's going to attack you!

G-Giorno!

Secco

Sanctuary

Hurry and climb up!

There are times when you truly feel
blessed, aren't there, Giorno Giovanna?

I believe there are two situations
in which you feel blessed.

The first is when despair changes
to hope... You feel blessed.

When your plant grabbed on to this helicopter,

I actually panicked because
I thought I was in danger.

I was in utter despair.

But I got through it.

I was able to turn that despair around
with my experience and mental strength.

And that makes me feel
truly blessed right now.

Golden Wi—

Don't you dare climb up here!

Giorno!

Did you forget that both of
my legs were still hiding?!

And the second situation that
makes one feel blessed...

is when you look down upon
someone who's in utter despair!

I've won!

By the time you hit the ground,

the mold will tear your body to shreds!

Giorno, take this!

Jump in there, Giorno!

Hurry and return to the helicopter!

Grazie, Number Five!

Pound him!

How pitiful.

Nothing's changed, Giorno Giovanna.

I, Cioccolata, am still going to win!

The branch you just grew is also living.

Meaning if it drops even a few centimeters,

mold will attack that branch!

Jump onto the helicopter, Giorno!

Hurry!

Giorno!

I did it! Now, show me that expression!

Show me despair!

Show me, as clear as can be,

the moment you lose all hope and die!

Show me your despair as
you fall to your death!

Bene.

The angle I calculated toward the
helicopter's propellers was perfect.

Because it was alive, the branch
was destroyed by the mold.

However,

the part of the branch that fell
from its root no longer holds life.

It's just a piece of wood.

Because you destroyed it,
the branch returned to being a bullet.

By the way, all that bullshit about being
blessed that you were yapping about...

I can't say I feel blessed at all,
even though I'm looking at you.

Because I've been winning
against you from the start.

You did it! I can't believe it, Giorno!

That was close!

You defeated him before the
mold got to the Colosseum!

Please take care of Mista's
wounds, too, Giorno!

That was close! Now the rest of
the Bullets will be back, too.

Could you move just a little
to the right, Number Five?

Huh?

I might just be worrying too much,
but... What was his name? Cioccolata?

He might actually be...

You're just pretending
to be dead, aren't you?!

And you're thinking.

Giorno?

If you can move your body just a few
centimeters before I climb up there,

you can slip beneath the trench and escape.

You'll be able to activate the mold again,

and you'll win. That's what you're thinking.

To be honest, I have a hole
in my right lung right now.

My subclavian vein has been
severed, and four of my ribs,

my right humerus, and my right
hand bones have been shattered.

I'm honestly not sure how
fast I can get up there.

But my Stand is Golden Wind.

It's a power type with a range of two meters.

If I just take a moment,
I'll be able to end you.

H-He's dead! You shot him through the head!

Good point.

If you continue to stay still,
I'll incapacitate you,

but I promise you I won't do anything else.

I'm giving you a choice.

So, what are you going to do?

I'm going to start climbing now.

Stay away from me!
Look behind you, you moron!

I've taken Mista and the turtle hostage!

You dumbass! While you were busy talking,

you apparently didn't notice
that I snuck my right arm

up from under the tree's shadow!

I'm going to chop off Mista's neck now!

If you come after me,
you won't be able to treat Mista!

Mista!

I'm the winner, after all!

Take this!

It's true.

I kept talking because I
wanted to buy some time.

The time I needed to make
the bullet that went through

your head earlier evolve
and return to your wound.

The piece that remained in your head lured
the bullet and returned to being a stag beetle.

When I aimed for the propellers,

I imbued it with Golden Wind's life force...

so that I could finish you for good,

whether you were dead or alive.

B-But you said... th-that if I stayed
still.... y-you wouldn't do anything...

Oh, please.

Did you really think you'd be that lucky?

A piece of shit like you?

Y... You're so mean!

Mon, Wed, Fri

Giorno!

Mista's waking up!

Mista! Mista!

What's that doing there?

Is that Cioccolata's... Don't tell me...

Was he actually on the
phone during the battle?

But with who? What was he telling them?

Why, though? Cioccolata...

Why aren't you answering your phone?

But I'm calling you...

Um, it's flashing...

What's this mean again? Um...

O-Oh, right!

It does this when I have voicemails, I think!

How many do I have? Two!
When did he call?

Was it when I was chasing Bucciarati?

It's me, Secco.

I-It's Cioccolata!

I finished off the gunslinger Mista.

Yes!

Now it looks like the newbie, Giorno Giovanna,
is trying to climb up to the helicopter.

But it doesn't matter. I win.

You concentrate on Bucciarati.

I'll scratch your back when you get back.

I'm sure you want some sugar
cubes, too, don't you?

I'll throw you some.

You deserve a treat.

How many would you like?

Um... Um...

Two?

No! I want more! More! Mooooooore!

I'm only kidding. I'll throw you five.

I'll throw five at once.

Think you can catch them all with
your mouth? No using your hands.

Listen well, Secco.

We are invincible.

The strong have the right
to rule over the weak.

No, I should say that the strong
have a duty to rule over others.

Even if that includes the boss.

I plan to surpass the boss
during this battle, as well.

You're going to do this, too, Secco.

You are strong.

Giorno's here. I need to hang up.

But that's why...

I love you.

Let's go.

This should be far enough.
I should've lost that underground guy...

Episodio 32
Green Tea and Sanctuary, Part 3Sanctuary!

Take this! I'm out of time!

As I thought... There's no mold growing on you,

even though you fell.

Cioccolata's Green Tea will
kill any living creature.

What the hell's going on with your body?

I mean, I guess I'll just have to pulverize

every last inch of your body
until you can't move anymore...

w-w-with my Sanctuary!

I don't think Ill be able
to defeat him quickly.

In that case... I'll lead him away

from here.

Episodio 31 Green Tea and Sanctuary, Part 3

This should be far enough to
lose that underground guy...

There are accidents everywhere!

What's going on?

Look! Someone's unconscious
over there, too!

Hurry up and save them!

An ambulance!

Over here!

Under the stairs!

Wh-What's...

Wh-What happened to the mold?!

C-Cioccolata?!

The mold disappeared.

Giorno, Mista...

They must've taken care of
the guy in the helicopter.

Secco, it's me.
Did you take care of Bucciarati?

Something rather unexpected
has happened on my end.

I'm about to take care of Giorno and Mista,

but I've taken a bit of a blow to the head.

So there's something I want
to tell you now, just in case.

Listen carefully, Secco.

Their destination is the Colosseum.

I found that out from the
Bullets' conversation.

Apparently, someone's
waiting for them there,

and this mysterious figure
knows how to defeat the boss.

That's why Giorno and the others
are trying to get to them,

and why the boss is trying to
stop that from happening.

Listen carefully. Figure out this
mystery before anyone else.

You're the only one I can count on.

What's with him?

Wait, that phone call... Was it...

Cioccolata, you piece of shit!

Did you actually think
I'd feel sad over you?

You loser!

You're super smart,

you'd throw me sugar cubes and play with me,

and you have a lot of money.

On top of that, you're super
strong... Or so I thought.

That's why I thought I'd be
safe if I listened to you.

But apparently, you're weak after all!

I mean, you lost!

I don't like you anymore, you scum!

I hate your guts!

He knows!

He knows that we're trying
to get to the Colosseum!

He intends to figure out the secret!

I won't let you go!

Half...?

Take this! Zipper Man!

What?!

By the way, doesn't "Colosseum"

sound kinda like "kill them"
(koroseyo) in Japanese?

Don't you think so, Mr. Language Teacher?

I thought I'd ask before I killed you.

Up until now,

I thought we'd be out of danger as long as
we stopped the man in the helicopter.

But things are still getting worse...

The actual threat is this guy who
can move freely underground!

If I let him get to the Colosseum
before we get there...

He's going to go on a rampage!

You're... a bit annoying... Bucciarati.

You already know... don't you?

At close range, I'm faster
and stronger than you!

You're a nuisance!
I'll take care of you here and now!

You sure know how to think fast.

You got away again...

Just barely, though.

But your body really is weird.

What the hell is the deal with you?!

You have glass shards stuck in you,
but you aren't bleeding much at all.

Did you... see that just now, too?

Hey... What do you think that is?

It came from the second
level of arches, right?

There was something shining.

It happened earlier, too.

Hey, something just hid in the shadows.

Was that...

I saw it... I saw a glimpse of it!

The light was reflecting! Someone was
looking over here with binoculars!

The guy you're going to go
see is definitely there!

He was in a wheelchair, wasn't he?

I think I saw some prosthetics, too!

Is he disabled?

I'm going to find out this secret!

No matter what the deal with your body is!

I'm going to end you, Bucciarati!

Are you mocking me? You went into
the ground with your zipper?

Are you copying me?!

Do you think you stand
a chance against me

by going underground?!

Take this! Sanctua—

He's not hiding. He's moving.

These vibrations...

He's moving in some direction...

Y-Y-You copycat!

Who the hell do you think I am?!

You and your piss-stained zipper guy!

H-How dare you steal my technique?!

But the only thing that
copying me is going to do

is ensure that you basically
just doomed yourself!

I won't let you get to the Colosseum!

The surfaces are getting softer...

So he is pursuing me!

But this sound...

This sound that's heading right
toward me with no hesitation...

They say that sound reverberates
better in liquids than in solids.

It's just like being under water.

Does that mean he can hear
when I'm moving, too?

You got way further than I thought,

but you can't run from me anymore!

I can tell... I can even tell
how far you are from me!

He's 20 meters ahead and to my left.

He moved to the right. Just 10 more meters.

Just seven more meters...

Five meters...

I'm not going to strangle you.
I'll bury you alive.

You can die in this grave you
dug for yourself, Bucciarati!

You think you can escape my punches

when you're surrounded by walls of dirt?

Just two more meters!

A water pipe?

You cut it to try and trick me?

Seriously?

The fact that you're trying
these stupid little tricks

proves that you're feeling cornered!

You basically just admitted that you'd lose,

even with your abilities, when you
have to face off with my Sanctuary!

I don't know where you are, but I do know
that you're within 20 meters of me.

You're staying as still as possible
so I won't be able to find you.

Or what?

Are you trying to come up
with some kind of strategy?

I mean, you are pretty quick-witted.

But...

I'll make you lose your upper hand...

You and your quick wit...

That's a different sound than before.

What is this sound?

I'm hearing it from all directions.

The stone pavement inside the ground...

turns to mud because my
Sanctuary touches it.

But the moment it moves
away from my body,

it hardens again.

Say, Bucciarati...

There might actually be a chance.

If you stay perfectly still,
you just might make it...

I mean, there's that miraculous story

about the death row inmate
who survived three hangings

because of the rope breaking
or the gallows malfunctioning!

It's no use... I can't stay
underground any longer!

But it's not like I can run
along the surface, either!

I was prepared for this,
but if he doesn't make it here,

I'm going to have to destroy the arrow.

Our only hope... is for them
to encounter this arrow.

The only ones who can surpass Emperor
Crimson, who has the ability to control time,

are those who know the true
power behind the arrow.

And the one capable of that is not me.

It's them.

Twelve years ago, I acquired this
arrow after fleeing Egypt.

And the fear that this arrow brings

will never end until they come.

J.P. Polnareff

The Colosseum in Rome
"Rome will exist as long as the Colosseum does;
when the Colosseum falls, so will Rome;
when Rome falls, so will the world. (A quote from a
certain medieval monk who saw the Colosseum)

This brief history... is rather ironic.

They joined a gang because
society had cast them out,

yet they're the ones trying to stop this
world from falling into the hands of evil.

But in the end...

Will Bucciarati actually
be able to make it here?

There's no point if he doesn't
come out the victor.

If he fails, I'll have to destroy
this arrow and its secret.

All I can do is wait for them to arrive.

Everything begins after that.

I've been waiting all this time...

just protecting this arrow's true power.

I-It's no use! I've reached my limit!

He moved! He couldn't take
it anymore and moved!

Twelve meters to the right. Bucciarati...

He's planning to hide beneath the Colosseum

so he can evade the barrage
of stone spears!

That's not gonna happen!

H-He's coming!

I can hear very clearly that
he's catching up to me.

I can feel the reverberations!
He's ten meters straight ahead!

Eight meters...

He's moving faster than me!

Zipper Man!

You know...

I knew he had something up his sleeve...

Bucciarati, is this the best you
could do in your desperation?

Though you are the only one who was able

to hide from my Sanctuary for even a second.

But now you're finished! I'm closer
than before. I'll find you soon.

The longer you hide,

the closer you come to your defeat!

Wh-What...

M-My skin...

Don't tell me...

Even the stone pavement
is turning into mud!

It stands to reason that your body

will start turning into mud the
closer I get to you underground.

I heard you! You're right there!

Now I've got you for sure. I can tell.

I'm 1.5 meters away from you.

So you've already made it to the Colosseum...

You were so close.

Take this! The secret will be mine!

Zipper Man!

To be honest, I don't really
know why, either...

But even after breaking some
bones, I barely feel any pain.

My heart has stopped, so I don't
bleed very much, either.

The damage to my body is minimized.

That's why I was waiting for this...

I'm sure my eardrums can handle the
damage they're about to endure, too.

I was waiting...

for you to drag anything and
everything into the ground.

Street lamps, street signs, parked cars...

And the tires on those cars.

Whoops. I guess you can't hear me anymore.

You bastard... N-Now you've done it...

But... This isn't a big deal.

I can still hear!

I could hear that tire popping!
I know where you are!

You're right there, Bucciarati!

M-My leg! Wh-Where am...

Wh-Why? Wh-Where is he?!

What did he do to me?!

How did I mistake a car for him?!

Your eardrums have been destroyed.

Your Stand that allows you to travel
through the ground...Sanctuary, was it?

Now that your ability's lost
its radar, your ears,

it's completely useless.
I figured it out, you bastard!

You're planning to destroy
my eardrums, aren't you?!

You think I can't travel through the ground
if my ears are destroyed, don't you?!

What a stupid idea!

Stay back!

Stay the hell away from me!

I won't take your life.

But now that you know about the man
waiting for us at the Colosseum,

I can't let you go, either.

I need you to stay put for a while.

You bastard!

You're trying to put me out
of commission, aren't you?!

Stay the hell away from me!

Just stop talking now.
This conversation isn't even coherent.

S-Stay away!

Score!

Th-The moment you attack me,
I'm gonna turn this kid into mud!

Then I'll throw him at you and run!

You don't wanna kill a kid,
do you, dumbass?!

Change of plans! For a while, I was
thinking about defeating the boss,

but I'll settle for just reporting this

to the organization and getting
a reward from the boss!

It's easier for me to just
work for the organization.

Hey, brat! Get me a taxi.

Raise your hand and flag
down a taxi for me!

You're going to get one for me!

Hey! Are you listening to me?!

You stupid brat!

Hurry up... and get me... a taxi!

Bucciarati! Why the hell are
you moving toward me?!

Can't you hear me?!

Your maximum range is two meters.

I'm very aware of that!

You're probably thinking I can't
get away because I hurt my leg!

Don't underestimate me! I'll kill this brat!

You couldn't reach me!
I'm out of your range!

You stupid piece of shit!

You just grazed my ha—
Wh-What the hell?!

A zipper! Shit, my throat!

I didn't need to even bother predicting it,

but in the prediction I saw,

there was no way that Bucciarati
would sacrifice a kid like me.

Shit! I need to undo this somehow!

Mon, Wed, Fri

Ah, Cioccolata!

Cioccolata!

I came here after tracing the
signal from Secco's cellphone.

But what's happening seems to be
different from the boss's orders.

To think that Secco had already lost...

Since they're a pair, that probably
means Cioccolata is also...

It also appears that
Bucciarati is here alone.

Where are Giorno Giovanna and Narancia?

Wh-What? My body suddenly...
All my strength is...

It can't be... My eyes are blurring, too...

Am I finally out of time?

I knew this moment would come...

But now?

Episodio 33
His Name Is DiavoloWh-What? My body suddenly...
All my strength is...

It can't be... My eyes are blurring, too...

Am I finally out of time?

I knew this moment would come...

But now?

I must go.

Go? Wait... I know Bucciarati
and his crew have a goal.

Where is he trying to go?

I'm sure the boss wants to find that out.

Pardon me.

Can I lend you a hand?

It's totally up to you, though.

What? You're still here?

I'm fine.

Go run along somewhere.

But... and excuse me if
I'm being presumptuous,

but I think it might be hard for
you to cross that road alone.

I really don't mind lending you my shoulder.

I mean, if you don't mind...

Well...

That might not be such a bad idea.

How far would you like to go?

Um... Just to the entrance of the Colosseum.

The entrance of the Colosseum...

Episodio 33 His Name Is Diavolo

There's no time. Just to the other
side of the road... Please...

Look out!

You stupid-ass drunk!

Are you okay?! Where were you look—

What? Why is Bucciarati so cold?

Sorry about that...

This is a guardrail?

Did I run into it?

Could it be that...
Bucciarati can't see anything?

He also ignored that car horn
when he tried to cross the road.

Does that mean he can't hear, either?

That wound on your throat...

Were you hurt during that scuffle earlier?

Actually, it looks like that wound
is from this morning or last night.

It's not bleeding anymore.

That's a strange place to be wounded.

He can somehow see it clearly.
But it's under my collar...

He's looking right at it!

At the wound that Risotto gave me!

Oh, you picked that up for me.

Thanks. I appreciate it.

Well... Ready to go?

Okay... Let's go.

He can hear me, too.

But something seems off,
for just being hurt in a fight.

What's going on?

That's Guido Mista!

Damn! I took too much time.

Of course he'd show up.

Is something wrong?

We haven't finished crossing yet.

No, um...

Sorry, the cut on my neck
started bleeding a little...

He's heading this way!

I apologize for being selfish,
but I'm in a hurry.

I need to hurry up and cross.

No!

Don't stand up!

I mean... There's another car coming.

Let's cross once it passes.

No, that's on the other side of the road.

We can cross.

Come on.

Let me cross.

N-No... Mista's coming!

I'm just going to have to
eliminate him right here...

Right now!

Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

I wonder what that sound was.

Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring,
ring-a-ling-ring-a-ling-ding...

What the hell are you doing?

What did you just say?

Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring,
ring-a-ling-ring-a-ling-ding...

Why am I getting a call right now?!

He's going to figure out who I am!

You're...

Bring, ring, ring, ring, ring...

You friggin' dumbass!

Why the hell are you calling me right now?!

Do you want him to find out?!

Trish!

Don't come outside yet!

The danger's not fully gone.
Get back in the turtle!

You don't understand. He's here!

I started getting that feeling again.

The same thing I felt in Sardinia...

Who... are you?

The person in front of me...

You're...

Rumble

Trish!

I can feel him! He's nearby.

The boss is nearby!

He's nearby?

You don't know exactly where, though?

He just suddenly appeared...

But I don't know where.

Thank goodness. You're safe.

Well done. You did excellent work.

This is why you're my most trusted
and number one subordinate.

Don't worry.

Bucciarati is looking at you right now,
but he doesn't actually see you.

What do you mean?

I don't know how this happened,
but Bucciarati is already a corpse.

His heartbeat has stopped,
and he's not breathing properly.

He can't see, and his eardrums
ruptured in his battle with Secco.

All he can see right now, Doppio,
is the shape of your soul.

All he can hear is the energy of your soul.

He can't see objects like guardrails,

and all he can see in cars are
the souls of the drivers.

What's wrong, Trish?

Did something happen?

My daughter's soul and mine
have a similar scent.

That's what I gave you just now.

All Bucciarati sees is
the form of my daughter!

Get Bucciarati to lead you to
whatever he was seeking.

Have him take you there!

Trish...

Sorry... I'm tired, so I spaced out a bit.

But thank goodness you're safe, Bucciarati.

Yeah... More importantly,
was there a young man nearby?

Oh, I saw him rush off somewhere in a hurry.

More importantly, Bucciarati,
let's hurry to our destination.

You're right. I hate to bother you,
but could you lend me a hand?

I can't seem to gather enough strength...

Yes,

of course.

Diavolo

Emperor Crimson

It's rather small, but Trish, I have
a house in the suburbs of Naples.

Once all this is over...
if you don't have anywhere to go...

You can live there.

There's a school nearby,
as well as a great restaurant.

It's close to the beach, too.

You've had nothing but horrible
things happen to you,

but you still have a chance
to enjoy a new life.

Thanks. But more importantly
right now, where should I head next?

Go up those stairs...

Upstairs?

Don't turn your head, Doppio!

Keep going as though you
haven't noticed anything!

There's someone here.

Upstairs, behind one
of the stone pillars.

Someone is watching you!

It appears that his goal
was to meet with someone.

But who could it possibly be?
I haven't the slightest idea...

Boss, how do you know they're here?

And if I don't turn around and look,
I won't be able to tell who they are.

Look at Bucciarati's eyes.
That should be enough.

He's reflecting in
Bucciarati's eyes right now.

Don't move!

Stop right there.

Take even a step up those
stairs, and our deal is off.

You're right! There's someone
hidden behind one of the pillars!

My name is Bruno Bucciarati!

I came this far because I
trusted you when you said

you had a way to defeat the boss!

I know that.

But before we get to that,
who's that next to you?

There's nothing about them
anywhere in my records!

And there shouldn't be!

Trish doesn't belong to the organization,
and I only met her a few days ago.

But as you can see, she's one of us.

Trish? That sounds like a girl's name.

Sounds like?

This isn't good... He's
going to find us out, Boss!

Calm down. Listen to me.
This is what you're going to say:

"Do you have a problem with me being
a girl?" Go on, say it, Doppio!

Do you have a problem with me being a girl?!

I guess I said something I shouldn't have.

It's a bit dark in here,
so I couldn't see you well.

Is she a Stand user?

Of course! But enough questions!
What I want to know is, who are you?

Let's just get to the point of this meeting!

No, not yet. I want to see her Stand.

Trish! Move slowly.

I have no data on you,

but if you show me your Stand
from there, I'll trust you.

B-Boss...

Who the hell is he?

He's definitely got experience fighting.

He's even thinking about a Stand's range...

Who could he possibly be?
I really have no idea...

Well? Hurry and show me from that spot.

Move slowly, as if you're
lifting up your skirt.

That's... It can't be!
Why does he have that?

That arrow... There's no doubt about it.

That's the arrow from back then!

Wh-What's this ominous
murderous intent I feel?

It feels like someone's pointing
a knife right at my heart...

I've felt something like this before...

Don't tell me—

No, wait... That's right.
There is one person I can think of.

He used the arrow to track me down...

He's—

In Egypt, I dug up the arrows that
awaken Stand abilities within people.

I knew the moment I saw them

that these arrows had some mysterious power.

An old woman named Enyaba
who had two right hands

told me she'd tell me how the arrows
worked in return for shooting some.

I figured one would be more than enough,

so I sold the other five for a handsome sum.

Come to think of it, that old woman
said something rather bizarre...

The arrow chooses people,

and those people are attracted
to one another like magnets.

In the 90s, me and my old friend
Jotaro Kujo were investigating

these arrows that brought
out one's Stand abilities.

We heard about a young man who
had dug up the other arrows,

and we split up to be more
efficient in searching for him.

Jotaro went to America and Asia.

I went to Europe and Africa.

And I managed to find out
that one of the arrows was

in a region of Italy where drug-related
crimes had suddenly skyrocketed.

I investigated an unusual
region where drug crimes

involving young people and their
victims had increased twenty times,

and I knew I was finally close.

But...

My organization was nearing
perfection after just a few years.

My subordinates swore
their loyalty to me.

I had men hiding in all branches of society.

I had a notion that someone
was trying to track me down.

In the end, I would finish them off myself.

That's the most surefire way.

I'd already decided that.

But I ended up making two big mistakes.

My first mistake was that this crime
organization was already complete.

Communications, the government, the press...

Society itself had isolated me.

And my second and greatest mistake...

Silver Chariot!

I guess I'll tell you,
since you're going to die.

The man who had unearthed the arrows

had powers far more sinister
than I could have ever imagined!

The moment that anyone
sees Emperor Crimson...

Boom

This ability...

Time... It...

...they are no longer in this world.

Is there no hope...?

I'm certain that I killed him!

To think that someone I had eliminated

in the past would show
up again with an arrow!

Bucciarati! The one next to you is—

Wh-What? Bucciarati!

Where'd the person next to you go?!

They disappeared! Don't tell me...

Where did they go?!

Where did the one you brought here go?!

T-Trish...

I'm asking you who the hell
that person next to you was!

I didn't hear or see anything fall,
but a piece is already behind me...

No... These movements...

Time just skipped!

Just like what happened in Venice!

We moved further up the stairs
before we realized it!

We're not gonna make it!

The man waiting for us at the Colosseum
just entered the boss's range!

This is a test.

I've accepted this test to stand
victorious against my past.

A person grows once they are able
to defeat their weaker self.

Wouldn't you agree, Jean Pierre Polnareff?

You're...

Rumble

Diavolo!

It appears that no matter how
much I tear apart the past,

it still manages to wriggle up
like a worm from under a rock.

This is surprising.

No wonder I couldn't think
of anyone who opposed me.

How did you get here?!

But in the end,

it doesn't matter how you survived after
I scattered your remains in the ocean.

What's important, Polnareff,

is what you were trying to
tell Bucciarati and his men!

Don't you dare set foot on those stairs!

I'm up here! You're down there!

Why won't you fight yourself, Polnareff?

Because you no longer have
the mental capacity for it?

Or are you no longer physically able to fight?

What are you going to use that arrow for?

This is impossible. I'm sure
it was a kid down there!

Diavolo... When did you get so close to me?

You're the one below me, Polnareff!

As long as you are below in Hell,

it doesn't matter what you
plan to do with that arrow!

There! Silver Chariot!

I see your Stand ability
hasn't lost any of its power.

And it seems you've learned...

You've figured out how to see when time
has skipped by counting drops of blood.

I see. In just a moment's
difference in number...

Your timing is genius, too.

If I had been any closer,
I would've been gravely injured.

This is the worst...

I can't believe the first person
to get here was Diavolo...

I won't have another chance. But I must...

I must protect hope at all costs!

You're already within my range!

You won't escape this time!

Emperor Crimson!

Now, once the passage of time resumes,

you won't be able to see how
many drops of blood there are.

I've just defeated my weaker
self from the past!

Take this! The passage of time will resume—

Wh-What is this?

The arrow... The Stand...

I don't know what it's doing, but...

Take this!

This arrow... What is it doing to Chariot?!

There's some kind of
power behind this glow!

Time, resume!

Impossible! What did you do?

The arrow does more than
just draw out Stand abilities?

This is my gamble to keep
the arrow from Diavolo.

I didn't want to show him that,

but I don't have the power to fully
control the arrow any longer.

You won't get away!

Stab

That arrow is our hope...

The one who can fully control that arrow
will be the one to control the world.

I-It happened again!
It skipped! Time skipped again!

Trish! Where's the boss?

You spent years uncovering some
incredible secret about the arrow.

I guess you held out a
pretty long time, Polnareff.

But unfortunately for you,
I have the arrow now!

It appears your heart has stopped.

But the life you lived
was not a complete waste,

Jean Pierre Polnareff.

You have been ever so useful... to me.

Giorno!

L-Look over there! It's Bucciarati!

Hey, he looks really hurt!

Bucciarati!

Be careful! The boss is somewhere nearby.

So you've come...

What?

Who are you?!

How long have you been standing there?!

Episodio 34
The Requiem Quietly Plays, Part 1Time, resume!

Stab

What?

Who are you?! How long have
you been standing there?!

Wait! Who are you?

What's that mark I can see on your neck?

Wh-What is this? What's going on?

Why did the arrow fall from my hands?

You! I told you to stop!

Show me... your... face...

Why am I sitting down?

He was on top of the wall
where Chariot melted...

Could it be... the arrow's...

M-Mista! Something's wrong...

Th-This feeling...

Everyone else is also...

What's going... on...

No one can escape the fate that was chosen for them.

All that remains is the end, where you will all perish.

Eternal greatness exists only within myself.

Sing a song of sorrow in a world where time has vanished.

Episodio 34 The Requiem Quietly Plays, Part 1

Wh-What? Did I fall asleep?

What... happened?

It's already dawn.

Yeah. I'm not sure why, but it seems like
we've been asleep for a few hours...

Wh-What is this?

Why are my hands all wet?

Is this blood?

Wh-Why?

Were we attacked?

Are you hurt anywhere, Giorno?!

Dash!

Giorno! Get behind the wall!

You're right out in the open!

If you're hurt, you need
to tend to your wounds!

I-Is Giorno hurt? I can't
seem to see him anywhere.

Hurry up and hide, Giorno!

Wh-Where the heck is he anyway?

I can't see him at all from where I am.

Could you tell me where he is, Trish?

If he's hurt, we need to go save him!

What the hell are you talking about?

Huh?

Nothing you're saying makes any sense.

Wha—

What the hell is this?!

H-Hey, what the hell is going on?!

Why do I have these things?!

N-No, wait! I'm missing something!

It's totally gone!

What I'm missing is way more important!

Hey, Giorno! What's up with
the blood on your hands?!

Where the hell are you looking?!
You! I'm talking to you!

Y-You're talking to me?

I mean, I was surprised earlier, but whatever
this blood is, I don't feel any pain.

It must be from when the mold attacked.

I had Giorno fix it for me, but the
wound hasn't completely closed,

so I think the blood is from my shoulder.

The mold's attack?

But you...

What... in the world...

happened?

Did I fall asleep?

I feel strange.

Rumble

Wh-What the...

Th-This face...

G-Giorno's body and my body...

No, wait. It's our souls, our minds.

Could it be that while we were sleeping,
Giorno and I, and Mista and Trish...

Each pair's minds have been swapped?!

Oh, no... I... I...

What's with this face?!

This body!

I stink!

My armpits...

smell so bad!

H-Hey, come on, Trish!

That's not the problem right now!

We were attacked by a Stand.

It's definitely not the
boss's Emperor Crimson,

Why me? No!

but our minds have been
swapped for some reason!

Damn it! Could it be another
one of the boss's elite guard?

No, Narancia.

The boss is already somewhere
near the Colosseum,

so I don't think he'd rely on
one of his subordinates.

Plus, Mista and Narancia mentioned an attack, but is that really what this is?

Our minds have been swapped,
but we're not hurt.

What could have...

H-Hey, Giorno.

No matter what happens,
I-I'm still older than you. Got it?

Oh, my gosh! I have hair
growing on my fingers!

And my nails are so gross and malformed!

And they have so much dirt under them!

I can't deal with this!

I knew it! That stinks, too!

Why? Why did I have to be Mista?!

H-How am I supposed to know?!

Probably because we fell
asleep near each other.

And is that really what you think about me?

Do I smell that bad?

Hey!

What the hell are you touching there?!

H-Hey, don't get the wrong idea!

I wasn't trying to touch it!
It's just itchy around the elastic...

Don't stick your fingers in my panties!

Okay, I got it...

If you spread your legs any
further, I'll kill you.

Okay, I get it! But you're wearing panties
to make your butt look firmer,

so everything's so tight and itchy!

You're even wearing a push-up bra.

Just so we're clear!

The next time you stick your hand
into my skirt, I'll kill you!

I'm going to

curse you to death!

Narancia!

Tch. Don't you get it? That's Giorno.

And so what, you're going to kill yourself?

Stop that!

Hey, guys...

I, um, have a question.

So, Bucciarati...

Um, so it's me and Giorno,
and Mista and Trish.

If we swapped minds with
whoever was closest to us,

then who did Bucciarati...

I've been watching him,
but he's not moving at all.

Is he okay?

Stay away from him, Narancia!

Huh?

There should be someone else
inside Bucciarati, too.

And we don't know who that is.

Is that what you're saying, Giorno?

It all comes down to what went down
at this Colosseum before we got here.

Who was near Bucciarati?

And what happened to the boss and the
man waiting for us at the Colosseum?

Narancia, scout the area with Li'l Bomber!

I've been trying... but...

Something's wrong. Li'l Bomber isn't...

M-My Stand ability...

Appear! Li'l Bomber!

It's no use! Li'l Bomber won't come out!

D-Don't tell me our Stands—

No, Narancia. That's not it.

Take a closer look.

Li'l Bomber!

I-It's so fast! It's so fast,
I couldn't even see it!

But what the hell?!

I don't know what's going on,
but I feel so refreshed!

I don't know what's going on, but...

...we're so full of energy!

My Stand is still with me,
but it seems to have powered up!

I destroyed six iron
railings in a single shot!

My mind is on point!

What in the world is this Stand ability
that can swap people's minds?

What's the purpose of this?

This Stand user...

As much as I don't want to
believe it, are they our enemy?

There's no one else nearby.

I can't tell if any of them are the boss.

Everyone around the Colosseum...

is fast asleep.

Even with my radar, I can't
really tell how far it reaches.

No, wait...

Some of them are moving just a little bit.

Some are even waking up!

Man, that was a great dream.

Wh-What the hell is this?!

I assaulted some female cop
and even handcuffed her.

Tweet, tweety tweet.

Arooo!

Waaah! Waaah!

So all the passersby got swapped, too?

Yeah, it looks that way.
There's confusion everywhere.

What a weird ability...

Hey, Giorno. What are you doing?

I should be able to sense a soul's
energy through the ground.

But I can't... Who is it?

Who did Bucciarati swap with?

Narancia... I mean, Giorno.

If you're thinking that the boss
and Bucciarati got swapped,

there's one thing that's clear.

That's not it.
That's definitely not the boss's soul.

If it were him, I would
be able to sense him.

But the strangest thing is that I'm
certain the boss isn't nearby, either.

The boss disappeared somewhere.

Bucciarati...

You're saying we won't know
about him until he wakes up?

Until then, we can't take
our eyes off of him.

It hurts...

Without question, the enemy is Diavolo.

Got it?!

I-It hurts...

But listen to me, Narancia... No...

Are you Giorno Giovanna?

Golden Wind!

No... I'm not speaking from inside the turtle.

It's me. I'm the one speaking.

My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff.

I was the one who arranged to
meet you here at the Colosseum,

but Diavolo backed me into a corner,
and I could no longer fulfill my promise.

Who swapped with who
Mista                Trish
Giorno         Narancia
Bucciarati
Turtle         Polnareff

Who the hell is this guy? Who's "Polnareff"?

Let me just say this first...

I only did this because Diavolo
left me with no other choice.

This strange phenomenon that's
happening to all of you right now...

is a part of the arrow's power,
the arrow I was supposed to give you.

I'm desperately hanging on to my
soul... so I can tell you this.

The arrow?

So you're saying this was
caused by that arrow?

To be more precise, it's because my Stand,
Silver Chariot, took hold of the arrow.

My body is already dead upstairs.

The reason I was able to swap souls
with this turtle and survive is

because of that arrow.

There's definitely someone in the
hallway on the second floor.

There's a dead guy who's been
knocked out of his wheelchair!

It's only my body? Where's Diavolo?

Hey! If everything you're saying is true,

your Chariot can return
us to normal, too, right?

No... I currently don't have the power
to control Chariot or make it disappear.

I don't even know where it is right now.

Chariot has basically gone berserk.

Your own Stand went berserk?

How irresponsible can you—

No. More importantly,
what happened with the boss?

What happened to him?

Where is Diavolo right now?

I don't know.

Diavolo was right in front
of me, but he disappeared.

All of you, listen very carefully.

The arrow is not your enemy,
nor is it your friend!

What I'm about to explain to you is hope!

Such a trivial... trivial coincidence
happened two years ago.

After I was incapacitated by Diavolo,

I somehow managed to survive
and hid in a small farming village.

That's where the trivial thing occurred.

The arrow we had retrieved in Egypt fell
between the wall and some furniture.

It's truly an insignificant thing.

Normally, one would just stick their
arm back there and pick it up.

But for my body, it was an arduous task.

I thought about just leaving it there,

but I figured that Chariot
could get it for me.

That's when it happened.

Chariot hurt its finger on the arrow.

It was mere coincidence.

The arrow draws out Stands from
those who have potential.

But if it happens to pierce a Stand...

I don't know how old that arrow is,

but I'm starting to understand what the
person who created it was thinking.

There's more to the power of a Stand!

Something that goes far deeper!

Suddenly, the birds in the sky fell,

bugs hid beneath leaves,
and cattle laid on the ground.

And the farmers started
sleeping in the streets.

I felt a slight change, but a much
bigger change had taken over Chariot.

I had a bad feeling, so I immediately
took the arrow away from it...

before it could go berserk.

Everything went back to normal,
as if nothing had happened.

Then I realized that if someone who had
enough power were to use this arrow,

they would have the power to control
the minds of all living creatures!

But I currently don't have
that kind of power.

And that's why I waited...

for someone like you who was
searching for Diavolo's true identity.

Though, in the end,
Diavolo was able to outdo me.

So this controlling minds thing...

Do you mean the thing going on right now?

It's just swapping souls?

No.

Remember when I said that this
was just a part of its power?

I can't control it, so I wasn't able
to see its potential beyond that.

But it definitely exists!

Go retrieve the arrow!

Stop Chariot before the boss can,
and reclaim the arrow!

The only way to defeat Emperor Crimson

is for you to use the arrow
to its full potential!

So in order to take back the arrow,
you're telling us to kill Chariot.

Am I assuming too much?

That's fine.

Once you take the arrow,
Chariot will be destroyed regardless.

Besides, I've already been finished off.

There's one other unbelievable and
important thing that I need to tell you.

Are you the girl called Trish?

Yes, though I currently have hairy knuckles.

I see...

The boss is a duo.

There was a kid who was somehow able to
transform into you and trick Bucciarati.

Diavolo and this kid were like
a well-coordinated team.

What? B-But how?

But that's impossible.

The boss trusts no one. That's how he
kept his identity secret for so long.

I'm not sure what happened, either...

But there was definitely a mysterious kid.

If it wasn't for that kid, there's no way
I'd have let Diavolo get that close to me.

Two... So the boss is a duo?

What's...

Giorno! Something's moving!

Nine o'clock. Uno signal.

It's a person!

There's a person heading in
from the gate on the right!

H-He's...

That face!

The boss! No... Diavolo!

Narancia...

Get Li'l Bomber behind him—

Giorno, wait!

The left! Look to the left, in the shadows!

So there it is!

That's my Stand, which the arrow evolved...

Chariot Requiem!

He's—

Th-This isn't good!

Diavolo was looking for Chariot!

He's trying to get the arrow!

Giorno, wait!

Don't attack just yet!

That Stand!

It's Zipper Man!

Th-That's Bucciarati!

It's Bucciarati's...

soul!

Episodio 35
The Requiem Quietly Plays, Part 2Could it be that while we were sleeping,
Giorno and I, and Mista and Trish...

Each pair's minds have been swapped?!

Don't attack just yet!

That Stand!

It's Zipper Man!

It's Bucciarati's...

soul!

No one can escape the fate that was chosen for them.

All that remains is the end, where you will all perish.

Eternal greatness exists only within myself.

Sing a song of sorrow in a world where time has vanished.

Episodio 35 The Requiem Quietly Plays, Part 2

Yes! Bucciarati's okay!

And he was going after the
arrow before the boss was!

The way you're talking...

Sounds like it's Narancia who's inside you.

Am I correct?

Yeah!

And you two...

I'm Giorno.

I-It's me, Trish.

Well done, Bucciarati.

You've already figured out
this bizarre situation.

That voice... Are you the man we
were supposed to meet earlier?

Indeed. My name is Jean Pierre Polnareff.

Stab

I was killed by Diavolo.

But I swapped souls with this turtle,

so I'm just barely clinging to
this world, basically as a ghost.

And that is my Stand.

The arrow's power caused it to go berserk,
and it is now Chariot Requiem.

That's the reason your souls
have all been swapped.

Wait. If our souls have been swapped,

then the one in my body is—

He hasn't woken up yet.

He's still out cold.

Are you... Mista?

Yeah. Glad you're safe, Bucciarati.

The boss, Diavolo,
who swapped minds with you,

is being watched by
Number Seven of the Bullets.

He hasn't moved an inch.
He's completely out.

Bucciarati!

Requiem's getting up!

We already know how to use the arrow.

If we take control of that arrow,

everything will be over!

Rumble

Gwooooar

Zipper Man... What in the world...

Pick up the arrow!

Requiem's charging at you!

Boom

Boom

Boom

Boom

Stop

I'm gonna knock the arrow away!

Hurry and pick it up!

Something's wrong!

Don't tell me that was...

Take this!

I'll put a hole in your brain!

The pillar next to you!

Mista, duck!

Boom

Spicy Lady!

Smack

Blam

I'll splatter your brains on the ground!

On the ground!

Let the ants swarm around you!
The flies swarm around you!

What the... Number One? Where the
hell did you come from? Hey, stop!

Cut it out!

Huh?

What's wrong, guys?

What...

It can't be...

H-Hey!

It's going to pick up the arrow!

It's going to pick it up!

What the hell?

What the hell just happened?!

I think this is

Requiem's Stand ability
when it's in berserk mode.

This is the first time I'm
witnessing it, as well!

Now that Requiem has gone berserk,
it has carried on my wish

and has become a defensive Stand.

All to make sure it doesn't let
anyone else have the arrow!

Anyone who tries to touch the arrow
gets stopped by their own Stand!

The arrow has the ability
to control your mind...

Are you saying this is a part of that?

So then, what the heck are we supposed to do?

Our Stands have powered up.

B-But, I mean...

If we try to get the arrow with that power...

S-Stop that,

Benedict!

There, there... It'll be okay.

Mista! Number Seven, the one
keeping watch, is freaking out!

Bucciarati's body...

is awake!

Diavolo? No way!

We'll have to go after the arrow later!

Position yourselves where
you can see his body!

Mista! Shoot him now!

What are you doing?!
Hurry up and shoot him!

B-But that body is yours, Bucciarati!

Bullet wounds...

are wounds my Golden Wind can fully heal.

We need to make sure he can no longer move.

That's what you're saying...
Right, Bucciarati?

He stood up! He's starting to walk!

Boom
Boom

He's convulsing!

He won't be able to come at us anymore!

No one else is showing up on my radar.

No one's coming to save him!

We did it.

Now, once we get the arrow
back... it'll all be over.

Once we get back to Naples,
I'm gonna go to school!

I wanna eat some piping-hot pizza, too!

Authentic margherita from back home,
where it's baked over an oak wood fire!

I'll get some porcini mushrooms on it, too!

And then...

If I ever see Fugo again...

Maybe I wouldn't mind him calling me dumb.

Too bad Abbacchio's gone now, though...

Trish!

I'm going to protect you until the end!

We all will!

Narancia...

Mista.

Just in case, shoot both of his legs, too.

R-Right!

Trish, you have my bullets.

Give them all to me.

They're inside my boot.

S-Sure...

Hurry up, would you?

Come on, hand over the bullets!

M-Mista...

Time just skipped ahead a few seconds!

Yeah! There are bullets on the ground,
but I don't remember hearing them fall!

But that's impossible!
I didn't see it at all!

Not him bringing out Emperor Crimson
or making it disappear, either!

And why?

He hasn't moved an inch from that spot!

Trish, drop one more bullet from my hand.

Hurry it up!

The number of bullets on the ground is four!

I can't deal with the number four!

Four is the number I just
can't have around me!

If it fell when you handed them to me,
then you have to drop another one!

Is he actually Diavolo?

Trish, when we woke up, you mentioned that

you couldn't sense the boss's presence
from that body at all, right?

What about now?

Do you sense the boss nearby?

But that's not possible!

You swapped with Narancia,
and Mista swapped with Trish.

That means Bucciarati
switched with Diavolo!

That's Requiem's ability,
once it's gone berserk!

I don't really get what's going on,

but if time just skipped ahead,

then it's a fact that that body isn't
the one controlling Emperor Crimson!

Narancia, what's going on in the area?

Is there anyone else trying
to come near here?

Narancia?

Trish, please...

You need to drop... drop one more
bullet from my hand... please...

I don't know...

I don't know why I can't sense the boss.

I have no idea why!

Move. Move!
I can't sense him anywhere...

Let me through! Please!

Please! Move out of my way!
Impossible! There's no way
this should've happened!

Keep an eye on our surroundings, Mista!

Watch our backs!

Narancia!

Cut the iron bars, Bucciarati!

We need to hurry up and get Narancia down!

Leave it to me, Mista! Leave this to me!

You need to load your gun, Mista!

He'll do it again!
His attack had already begun!

Zipper Man!

Now heal him!

Hurry up and get the iron bars out of him!

The civilians outside the Colosseum
are starting to wake up.

Where is he? I didn't sense
any trace of the boss at all!

I don't get why his presence seems to
disappear and then reappear anymore...

Emperor Crimson's range is
two to three meters, at most.

So then how did he... from over there?

H-Hey! You did it!

Narancia's awake now!

Yes!

Th-That was a close one...

No... Mista.

This is... an empty... shell.

It's an empty shell.

The wounds he received...

have already been healed by my Golden Wind.

But... he's already gone.

Narancia...

isn't...

It's... completely empty.

His soul...

It's gone.

He's gone now.

There's nothing I can do...

I didn't make it in time...

It's so empty that I could slip right
back in... I could coexist in both bodies...

That's just how...

empty this body is.

Narancia!

This is too sudden...

Jean Pierre Polnareff
Silver Chariot

Where is he?

Where could he be?

This is inconceivable!

This can't be possible unless
there are two Diavolos!

Two of them...

That kid and Diavolo...

Don't tell me there are
actually two of them...

Rumble

There's only one body, but two minds!

Bucciarati! I figured it out!

Diavolo has two personalities!

That's the only possible way!

The one in that body right now
is the kid that I encountered.

The kid and Diavolo have the same body,
but their minds are separate!

At times, people's minds

can be scarred and split due to a
traumatic experience during childhood.

As they grow older, that split can
develop into a separate personality.

That split personality starts to appear much
more distinctly as they reach adulthood,

and one personality will
be dominant over the other.

That's the multiple
personality disorder theory!

Listen carefully. What I just
said isn't a hypothesis.

I've even heard of reports
from Germany and England

where the individual's physical features
change depending on the personality.

Requiem's ability tore his
soul away from his body.

One of them, the kid,
ended up in Bucciarati's body,

but the other one...

And it could be coincidental,
but they ended up in someone else's body.

That's who Diavolo is!

Emperor Crimson attacked from their body!

What are you talking about?

Two personalities?

That's who the boss really is?

Slowly but surely,
people are waking up outside.

So I don't know where he's hiding.

But he will come again!

He'll attack again, and soon!

That's possible...

But he could've already left the area.

Diavolo is also after the arrow.

That's why he attacked Narancia first.

He got rid of our radar first.

So we wouldn't be able to tell
that he was going after the arrow.

That's why he took down Li'l Bomber.

This just means you'll have to
obtain the arrow's power after all.

Either way, if you're going
to destroy Emperor Crimson,

you need to find the arrow before he does,
and get it away from Chariot somehow.

Which way did Requiem go?

To the left.

It looks like people are starting to
wake up in the direction he's headed.

Find it? But your body is...

What about your body, Bucciarati?

I missed all his vital points.

But he won't be able to stand up and move.

I made sure of that.

We're going to have to leave you behind here.

So that no one

can hurt you anymore...

Ever again.

But I promise

that I will take you back home.

Rumble

Watch out for anyone coming near us!

Let's go!

Trish! What are you doing? Stay close!

R-Right.

Hey, the woman running over there!
You're under arrest!

You're going to accompany me to the station!

Kablam

I-Is something wrong, Mista?

Nope! Everything's fine!

They got close, so I thought
it might've been the boss,

but it was just some cop.

It does indeed seem that Requiem

doesn't have a destination
in mind, nor any emotions.

It hasn't even looked at me
or the direction its heading.

It does look like a living creature,

but it also looks like something
resembling black plastic.

It hasn't even recognized me as an enemy.

It seems to be slow and even weak.

And it's a fully physically formed Stand.

Civilians can see and touch it.

Rip

Drag...
Drag

It's no use... It's not letting us get close.

It's not just our Stands.

If we try to touch it with something,
it'll come flying back at us.

This arrow might truly be invincible.

The more difficult this becomes,
the more I'm convinced that it has

some kind of isolation power
that repels everyone.

It's getting up again.

How can we pick up the arrow?

It's right in front of us!

Hey.

Requiem won't allow Stand
users to pick up the arrow.

But what if someone who's not a Stand
user tried to pick up the arrow?

Well, what do you think will happen?

Why are you asking me that?
How the hell would I—

Rumble

H-Hey, guys!

My soul is holding on for
dear life within this turtle.

I'm no longer a Stand user...

so I was able to touch it!

Mista! Hurry up and pierce
your Stand with this arrow!

Episodio 36
Diavolo SurfacesSo there you are... Boss...

That's where... you were...

And that's... whose body you're using.

The moment I got tired and could
feel my soul being sucked out,

you said you had to go because
things were going south...

It's true...

If you're there, Boss...

We're going to win for sure...

But...

I'm so lonely...

Could you... call me again...

like you always have?

Boss...

No one can escape the fate that was chosen for them.

All that remains is the end, where you will all perish.

Eternal greatness exists only within myself.

Sing a song of sorrow in a world where time has vanished.

Episodio 36 Diavolo Surfaces

Mista! Hurry up and pierce
your Stand with this arrow!

What's going on?
Requiem's suddenly heading toward us.

Giorno! Stop Requiem!

I can't! It's too far away!

Crack

Wha—

My gun...

What are you doing, Mista?!

It's because you're touching the arrow!

No way! Why is this...

Let go of it, Mr. Polnareff!

Let go of the arrow!

Glad I took that cop's Beretta just in case.

But what the hell, Bullets?

Why'd my revolver break all of a sudden?

M-Maybe the boss got close?

You dumbass! Think before
you talk, Number Five!

Are you saying you saw someone coming
close to us in this big, open space?

We didn't see anyone at the
moment the revolver broke.

It's metal fatigue.

It's because he's been overusing the gun.

The axis of the cylinder broke.

We haven't had a chance to do
any maintenance or inspections!

H-Hey!

What the hell is this thing's problem?
It's heading toward m-me!

No, Mista. It's heading towards me.

Even though it has the arrow back...

Golden Wind!

Batoom

Requiem intends to finish me
because I touched the arrow.

Mista, run!

Reload, Bullets! Reload the gun!

This isn't a revolver!
We need another cartridge!

It'll take time to reload it!

I-It's no use...

I'm finished...

I'm throwing it! Catch it, Giorno!

I'm gonna throw the turtle to you!

Mr. Polnareff!

You okay, Mr. Polnareff?

He's okay. B-But... how?

Mista, do you remember what
I said back at the Colosseum?

There's still more to Requiem's
ability that I'm not aware of.

But I'm starting to understand.

Requiem stopped because
the starting time has come.

The starting time?

Yes.

It's because

my body has started to change!

That's why it stopped trying to kill me!

This is Requiem's true motive,
now that it's gone berserk.

The ability to make beings swap souls,

meaning the ability that makes them
start to change into something else.

The prelude is over, and the actual
piece is now starting to play,

so it gave up on killing me.

The 4.5-billion-year history of this
world's creatures is starting to change

into something else within a matter of hours.

All of it!

I see...

So that's what makes Requiem
so truly frightening.

However...

Thanks to them, I was able to see it.

I'm starting to understand the answer.

I'm close to figuring out how to
get that arrow from Requiem!

I'm realizing the method!

Wh-What the hell is going on?

What's up with this ability?

How far has this damn thing spread?

It doesn't look like they're
dying or in pain...

Everyone just has these vacant stares.

But there is this fear of
becoming something else.

The fear that, slowly but surely, both my
body and my soul are going to disappear.

Trish!

I-I'm fine. But...

The starting time is imminent.

It will happen differently for
each of us, but it'll start soon,

for all of us.

We don't have much time left...

That's what you're saying?

Polnareff! This is happening
because you brought the arrow!

You said it had the power to defeat the boss,

but instead, you basically ended us!

Stop! This is far beyond
anyone's expectations.

It's more important that we
find a way to defeat Requiem.

That's right. Good. Get closer.

Get closer to Requiem!

If we get closer, I'll be able to fully see
Requiem's secrets, because I'm right here.

The arrow's power will become mine,
and the world will grovel at my feet!

After it!

Good!

Don't move, Mista!

Trish, Bucciarati! Both of
you stay where you are!

Stay right there!

Wha—

I just told you not to move, Mista!

We can catch up to Requiem in a second!

What the hell? Shut up, you dumbass!

My body's disappearing already!

I picked up your revolver.

The one that you said broke a moment ago.

This broken part doesn't match up
correctly with the rest of it.

If it just broke due to metal fatigue,
they should still fit together.

What are you getting at, Giorno?

Bucciarati, I need you to
stay right there, too!

We need to keep a distance from each other!

You dumbass! Requiem is getting away!

The Bullets said it was metal
fatigue, so it's metal fatigue!

I have a new Beretta, too!

The parts aren't matching up
because a piece flew off!

That could be...

But it could be something more.

We'll be able to tell as soon
as we see this lost piece.

Golden Wind.

I gave a part of the gun
life and let it loose.

Moles are basically blind, but their
sense of smell is unparalleled.

Looks like it's returned,
and it found its lost piece.

Fit

H-Hey, wait a sec!

Are you saying someone just used
immense force to tear the gun apart?

Listen up! The Bullets and
I are very clear on this!

There's no one who got close
to me in this square—

You're exactly right. No one did.

That's why we need to stay
apart from each other,

because his range is only a few meters!

Giorno, you...

No one got close to Narancia
when he was attacked, either.

No one... other than us.

Mr. Polnareff, if your guess is correct
and the boss had two personalities,

then he should be able to get in
and out of another's mind freely.

Diavolo has inhabited one of us.

Wha—

If he stays hidden,
Trish can't detect his existence.

The reason he's staying hidden now

is because he's waiting for us
to obtain the arrow for good.

That's why he also appeared for a
brief moment to destroy the gun.

W-Wait a second!

I know I keep saying this,
but stay away from me, Mista!

Stay out of his range!

My gun was destroyed!

You're the one closest to the gun.

I-It's...

It's not me!

O-Oh, yeah. When Narancia was attacked...

The one closest to him was...

Shit. I must do something.

Requiem keeps moving farther away.

This rookie, Giorno Giovanna...

He's hiding in one of us.

But despite that, we have one advantage.

Diavolo can make Emperor Crimson appear,

but he doesn't have complete control
of the body he's inhabiting right now.

If he had total control

of the body he's currently inhabiting,
he wouldn't just stay quietly hidden.

It's because he can't manifest
and move around freely

that we all still live and
haven't been eliminated.

In a sense, we have him cornered.

It's the turtle!

It was the closest one to my revolver!

Polnareff is the one who's possessed!

That's not possible.

Mr. Polnareff was almost
killed by Requiem earlier,

because the boss destroyed the revolver.

The boss won't let the body he's
inhabiting be put in danger.

Plus...

I only sense one being's life force.

This turtle only has one soul in it.

You can tell that, Giorno?

Only if I can get closer
and touch their body.

How can you be so certain?

Life force is a mass.

If I actually touch someone,
I can tell how many there are.

There's no other way.

I have to touch each one of you and find out.

But how are you going to get closer
within Emperor Crimson's range?

I learned how to detect
Emperor Crimson from Mr. Polnareff.

The moment the droplets suddenly
increase is when time has skipped!

Correct.

But whether you can avoid his attack
or not will be a matter of luck,

as is whether you'll be able
to just barely dodge it.

It's definitely not me.

When Narancia was killed,
I was the farthest away.

Then I'll check you first
so we can be at ease.

Hey!

Stop right there! Stay away from me!

D-Don't come any closer!

If Diavolo is actually in you,
what's going to happen to me?

When Narancia died, his body was empty.

My soul was able to travel from
Narancia's body into my own,

but it was empty.

There's no chance that he's possessing me.

Oh, really?

That's just what you're saying.

I have no way of confirming your ability.

Not to mention, Giorno,

do you have a way to definitively
confirm that you only have one soul?

You can't check yourself with
your own ability, can you?

Mista, we can't go after the
arrow unless we find out!

Come any closer and I'll blow your limbs off!

Stop!

Check me first, Giorno.

Hurry up and do it!

We're losing more and more time.

Just as you said,

depending on how we look at the
situation, we have the boss cornered.

There's no other way.

Yes...

We have to do this right now.

Someone's going to be attacked...

If we get closer to one another...

Slice

Giorno!

It's Mista!

He was the one possessed!

Spicy Lady—

No, Trish!

It's you!

He got closer instantly by
moving your body closer to him!

I've been waiting for this
moment, my daughter...

The moment you unleashed your Stand!

My daughter...

If you hadn't revealed your Stand,
I might've actually been cornered...

Zipper Man!

If I can grab the Stand,
I can also move the body.

Now I can at least make this body run.

We're going to be attacked!
Brace yourselves!

He's going to make time leap—

Wha—

D-Don't tell me...

Why's he running without attacking us?

Through observation, he's already found

a way to get the arrow away from Requiem!

There's no time! That takes priority!

Shoot, Mista!

Don't let him get there
first, no matter what!

Stop wasting time!

This isn't the time to hesitate
because that's your own body!

That's not it...

I've already fired, Bucciarati.

It seems that... I've already fired six shots.

He's running as he makes time leap!

He predicted the course of the bullets!

After him! If he gets the
arrow, we're finished!

That shadow...

The reason no one can touch the arrow...

If I'm correct...

When I move, Requiem's shadow moves
in the opposite direction from me,

despite the location of the sun.

Which means...

To that man, it should look like the
shadow is stretching toward me.

In Bucciarati's eyes, the shadow is
stretching in front of Requiem.

Which means...

This shadow is in different
places depending on the viewer!

This is the mystery of Requiem!

This is why it can control everyone's souls!

This thing is the shadow of one's soul.

Requiem itself is the shadow of my soul!

That's why attacking it will
mean attacking yourself!

If we can get rid of this shadow,
I can get the arrow!

And...

If it has a shadow, then my own
light should be somewhere, as well!

He still doesn't have the arrow!

We're rushing in, Mista!

The light is behind my own mind!

He just destroyed something behind his head!

What in the world did he do?

Now I've got it...

I, Diavolo, now have the arrow!

If Diavolo found a way to grasp the
arrow, we should take advantage of it.

Because the arm he tore off of me and these
droplets of blood are all just particles.

Golden Wind shall now

appear!

These ants!

What just happened?

This is good, so far.

Let's go...

We have to hurry.

Blast the arrow away from him!
Don't let him grab it, Mista!

I'm already shooting!

They made it through!

Despite him predicting their
movements, we're still far apart.

He can only knock the ones coming
at him out of their trajectory!

The rest of you knock that arrow
back and bring it to me, Bullets!

H-He'd already thrown...

...a civilian into the air!

He figured out the bullets would land
and returned the arrow to its place!

The trash ability of an underling...

There's no way your weak mind can
surpass Emperor Crimson's predictions.

You will not be able to get through.

You're still just trash.

I will admit though, Bucciarati,

your team has made me sweat.

I never dreamed you would be foolish
enough to betray the organization,

nor did I ever think you'd
find out my true identity.

But the fact that I've been able to figure
out this arrow's true power is a blessing!

It's a gift granted to me by fate
because I was able to defeat my past!

I need ammo, Bullets!

We told you, Mista!

It takes time to reload that cartridge!

We're finished!

Wh-What in the world?

Spicy... Lady...

You didn't deflect Mista's bullets.

I just made them softer.

The bullets stretched out like
chewing gum and stuck to your hand,

and I had them use their elastic force
to return and blow through it.

Trish... You're still conscious!

I'm going to overcome this.

I'm not going to live in fear
and run away from the fate

that you've passed on to me.

If it's in my way, I'll just climb over it!

The arrow's flying toward me!

I'm the closest!

He can't get past me!

Even if he predicts where
it'll fall and erases time,

I'm still closer to it!

If only... My daughter,

if only you hadn't been born...

Fear truly does come from the past.

You have genuinely angered me!

What?

Booooom

You said you'd overcome this, did you not?

You were right, Trish. Now you
can surpass not only the past...

but their heads.

Trish!

Episodio 37 King of Kings

T-Trish!

No way! He...

He attacked! He went through
Trish's mind... and into himself!

I guess I don't need this body anymore...

or you.

H-Her soul!

It's moving away!

Trish's soul is...

disappearing into the sky!

The arrow!

The arrow belongs to me!

It pierced me!

The arrow's power...
This gift given to me by fate!

Now my Emperor Crimson
will sit atop the world again!

Did it pierce me?

I-It didn't!

Wh-What... Something is wrong!

No... I can't even grasp it!

E-Emperor Crimson's hand is translucent!

And it's crumbling!

What?!

Th-This is...

My soul is leaving her body...

This wind is...

I-It can't be!

Could it be that all you can predict, Boss,

are the movements of arrows and bullets?

You couldn't seem to predict
what I was going to do.

Y-You bastard...

You're the one who discovered
the way to destroy Requiem.

This thing behind our heads...

Or rather, this thing that's
behind every one of our souls.

It just needs to be destroyed.

You wanted to pick up the arrow,
so you didn't completely kill Requiem,

Don't... Don't, Bucciarati...

but if I completely destroy mine...

The ability of Requiem, the Stand
that lost control, will disappear.

Don't, Bucciarati!

Look at me! Think about who's truly worthy!

Bucciarati... Y-You're...

Who is the king worthy of
possessing this arrow?!

Bucciarati! The weak are not
worthy to possess the arrow!

All the souls that have been swapped...

will return to their original bodies!

Trish's soul!

I-It's Trish!

Mista!

Everyone, look!

You did it, Bucciarati!

It was a close call, but she's returning!

I'm leaving the rest up to you, Giorno.

B-Bucciarati...

Y-Your body's back at the Colosseum.

That body is—

Giorno, I was reborn.

When I met you back home in Naples...

When I betrayed the organization...

My soul had been fated to
slowly die, but it was reborn...

Thanks to you.

This is what true happiness is.

This is how it should be. Don't worry.

Please give everyone my regards.

How dare you?!

All for a stupid little girl!

You vile pukes that some
loser spewed into a toilet!

Who do you think I am?!

I, Diavolo, shall be the
one to possess the arrow!

W-We did it...

Way to go, Bucciarati...

That was a close one...

but Trish will be okay now.

Giorno... You need to heal us.

Bucciarati's still at the Colosseum,
but I'm sure he'll be here in no time...

Right?

Don't worry about it, Giorno.

I'm only going back to
where I was supposed to go.

I'm simply returning to how I once was...

That's all...

Jean Pierre Polnareff

Chariot Requiem

Benedict!

I don't remember who said it, but...

"We are all soldiers chosen by fate."

But there are truths I've learned
from this world, as well.

Fate has given me the ability to make
time skip, and to predict the future.

There's no doubt about it.
That's the undeniable truth.

The fate of this world

was supposed to have chosen my Emperor
Crimson to stand invincible at the top.

I am no soldier.

Damn it!

And despite that, somehow...
that arrow is not in my hands!

How dare you?!

There's no way...

There's no way that I, Diavolo,
would lose like this!

I need to retreat for now.

I need to hide from the arrow and await
the ideal moment for my counterattack!

Retreating here is not admitting defeat.

I have the ability to take
myself back to the top!

Don't let him get away, Giorno...

No matter... what you do...

If he gets away, he'll go into hiding.

He's planning to run away, Giorno...

I just felt it... He took a step back!

Wha—

He's holding the arrow!

The one who will control the
arrow after Requiem...

is Giorno!

It's no use... There's no way I
can escape from here after all!

I'll lose my pride if I flee from them.

I am a king!

My only goal is to remain at the top!

If I flee now, my pride will be lost!

There is... no next time!

He's not running away!

He's coming this way,

despite how pointless that is!

Golden Wind!

He did it!

The one who will go beyond the power
of that arrow is Giorno's Golden Wind!

No! You're wrong!

I thank you, my daughter!

Because of your insulting claim
that I was going to run,

I was able to keep my pride!

Thank goodness I didn't retreat.

If I had fled, I wouldn't
have seen this premonition.

This unexpected premonition
from Emperor Crimson Eulogy!

Golden Wind!

He did it!

The one who will go beyond the power
of that arrow is Giorno's Golden Wind!

B-But why?

It went through him...
but the arrow's on the ground.

I'm so glad I didn't run away. So very glad!

To be honest, my heart was filled with despair.

If my daughter hadn't ridiculed me,

I wouldn't have decided to advance on you.

And because of that,

I saw a premonition of the
arrow falling to the ground!

Giorno Giovanna...
You weak little newcomer...

This means that you weren't a suitable vessel.

He's already disappeared,
but remember what Polnareff said?

The arrow decides who
is worthy to wield it.

I know I'm repeating myself,
but I'm truly glad I didn't run away.

You've been rejected by the arrow!

Giorno, run!

You're finished!

I, Diavolo, will be king,
just like I've always been!

G-Giorno!

Mista, wait!

The thing that's peeking
through the crack...

Could that be...

Th-That's...

What am I looking at right now?

I cracked his head open!

Shouldn't I be seeing his brains
spilling out right about now?

What came out wasn't brains...

Th-This can't be!

And the arrow's being sucked into his arm!

The arrow—

Shit! You're finished, Giorno Giovanna!

Th-That's...

Giorno wasn't rejected.

He wasn't cast aside by the
arrow because he was unworthy!

No... In fact...

The arrow is forever Giorno's!

The boss can never have that arrow now!

Am I looking at reality?

I must be seeing some kind of mistake.

I should be looking at Giorno's corpse,
with his head cracked open!

This cannot be reality!

It's Requiem...

That's Giorno's Requiem...

Golden Wind Requiem!

Golden Wind has gone beyond
the power of the arrow!

What?!

The only thing that will survive
is the truth of this world.

Righteous actions born of truth
shall never be destroyed.

My friends may have perished,

but their actions and wills
have not been destroyed.

They handed this arrow to me.

So, are your actions born of truth,

or are they merely superficial, born of evil?

We're about to find out.

Can you avoid destruction, Boss?

Wh-What's going on? What's about to happen?

Don't tell me our souls are
going to be swapped again!

I don't know... No one does.

Giorno probably doesn't, either.

But given what just happened, I know that
Giorno has complete control of Requiem!

It hasn't gone berserk!

I couldn't see it... I couldn't
see the moment he attacked!

But I was able to predict that attack.

The reason it didn't fully hit me is because

I was able to predict the
hole appearing in my hand!

I can dodge his attacks,
though just barely.

It's true that this Golden Wind's
attack yielded tremendous power...

But... that's all it's worth.

It merely powered up.

It's a threat, but I can still predict it!

This is not something I can't overcome!

Fate has chosen me as the
one to stand at the top!

I am the king who has overcome all threats!

Don't talk to me like you have any idea
what's going on, Giorno Giovanna!

I won't even give you the
chance to regret your death!

Emperor Crimson!

Time shall be eliminated
for everyone but myself!

I can see it... I can see
his Stand's movements!

I can perfectly see what it's trying to do!

I can estimate what these pieces
of trash are going to do!

That should fully stop
Golden Wind's movements!

Even after time starts moving
again in a few seconds,

your eyes will never be able to see
myself or Emperor Crimson again!

The pinnacle of truth lies within my abilities!

Yes! I've won!

I'm just a moment quicker!

I've completely ripped out his
heart in my premonition!

The future has chosen the
actions of my Emperor Crimson!

This is the end!

Wha—

What?

Don't tell me this is...

Is the time that I disposed of
reversing... because of Requiem?!

N-No! Everything is returning to normal!

But my premonition still favors me!

Take this, Giorno Giovanna!

Wha—

Wha—

Wha—

Wha—

Wha—

Wha—

Wha—

Wha—

Wha—

Wha—

What is this?

What am I seeing?

A-Am I dreaming?

Am I witnessing some kind of illusion?

No... that can't be true.

The only one who can move within
the time I've disposed of is me!

This is... Requiem.

What you're seeing is indeed the truth.

You are seeing the movements
created by your abilities,

but you will never arrive at the
truth that's going to happen.

None who stand before me
shall ever get there,

regardless of their abilities.

This is the power of Golden Wind Requiem.

This is unknown even to Giorno
Giovanna, who controls me.

Giorno Giovanna!

I won't even give you the
chance to regret your death!

What am I saying?

I-I...

haven't moved at all from the start!

Th-This premonition that I had...
It's the truth that's going to happen!

My invincible Emperor Crimson should
be heading toward victory!

All that remains is the end, where you will all perish.

Episodio 38 Golden Wind Requiem

Y-You did it! At last!

Your Golden Wind evolved
with the arrow, and...

I couldn't see what it did,
so I don't really know how,

but you finally defeated him!

But... wait a sec.

Did he float up anywhere?

Hey, where is he? Where's his body?

Damn it!

Where is he?! Find him, Giorno!

Where is he?!

I'm just...

barely... still alive...

somehow...

But...

What was that?

My prediction clearly showed
my victory... and yet...

What in the world... was that Requiem?

I need to escape... into this sewer for now...

I still... have enough strength left for that...

I did it...

Was I just lucky?

You jackass!

I-I'm not g-gonna let you
s-snatch my precious c-coat!

It's not happening!

What? You wanna fight?

Well, do ya?! Don't mess with me!

I'll take you on anytime!

Come at me, ya dickhead!

What?!

Come on! Come at me!

I-Impossible!

This can't be...

You're never gonna get my coat!

I can't stand up!

S-Someone...

You ain't getting it...

I-I can't... Not here...

You ain't getting it...

I-I'm Diavolo!

Not at the hands of a guy like him...

I'm fading...

Where am I?

Why am I sleeping on a bed?

I fell into the river, and then,
when I got into that sewer...

Let's see... Today's date is the 25th.

11:20 AM.

File number 68.

I, Dr. Monica Ultello,
will be handling this case.

We have an adult male,
between the ages of 30 and 40.

His identity is unknown.

Judging from the state of his skin, it's been about 48 to 54 hours since his death.

I will now begin the autopsy to
determine his cause of death.

Hey, woman... What are you talking about?

Although his body was found near the river,

Where am I? What am I doing here?!
he had barely any water in him,
so he couldn't have drowned.

Hey, woman!

I can't move...

M-My fingers...

My body...

What in the world is...

Hey, woman! Are you listening to me?!

Who the hell are you?

What are you doing?!

Why won't my body move?!

A-And this pain...

I-It hurts!

The cause of death is a stab
wound reaching his liver.

There are no marks indicating hesitation,
so we can rule out suicide.

Next, I'll dissect his abdomen
and check inside, just in case.

His liver is very healthy.
It's a very nice color.

I-It was just a dream?

Am I just dreaming?

But...

I-It's happening again.

What time is it? Where am I?

I was in the Tiber River in Rome...

And that feeling...

That unimaginable pain I experienced
in the autopsy room...

I-It was too real to be a dream...

Hello, sir?

Are you all right?

Why are you hunched over like
that? Are you not feeling well?

Jump

Hey, stop that!

What in the world is this?!

Something's wrong!

I-I couldn't possibly die
in such a stupid manner!

Don't tell me that this is...

Golden Wind Requiem's—

We have to find him!

I can sense that he's still alive!

I can't relax until we know for sure!

No, there's no reason to look for him.

What?

Everything's already over.

I wasn't able to clearly see
Requiem's ability myself,

but I know deep in my heart that it's true.

He won't be heading anywhere ever again.

In particular, he'll never arrive at the truth...

He'll never even arrive at
the truth behind his death.

Why are you hunched over, mister?
Does your tummy hurt?

Eternally.

B-But he's alive...

His end is that there is no end.

That's... Golden Wind Requiem's ability!

H-How many times am I going to die?!

Wh-When am I going to be
attacked next, and from where?!

S-Stay back!

Stay away!

S-Stay...

Stay the hell away from me!

So we finally did it?

We're the ones who won?

Hey, come on! Let's hurry
back to the Colosseum.

Bucciarati might've gotten his
soul back, but his body is hurt.

He's probably wondering what the hell
happened to us at the Colosseum!

Right.

Giorno, come on!
We're going back to the Colosseum!

Let's heal Bucciarati's wounds and head home!

Yeah...

Let's go.

I'll be right there.

Giorno, that's how it should be.

Don't worry about it.

What we've accomplished up to
this point is an absolute victory.

Fate is a sleeping slave.

And we've set that slave free.

That's what our victory is.

Giorno Giovanna

Golden Wind Requiem

Just hear me out!

Taking time to really think
about what you're eating

is connected to whether or not
you're living a happy life.

That's why I think it's really important.

So, there are animals
that are carnivores, right?

You know, like lions, cats, and vultures.

You won't find meat from carnivores
like that at a restaurant.

Why is that?

Because it's too smelly to eat!

It's disgusting!

Listen up, guys!
Cats are too disgusting to eat.

Are we on the same page so far?

I'd never eat a cat, even if some culinary
expert said it was the best thing ever!

On the other hand, have you
heard of a fish called "sweetfish"?

Sweetfish don't eat bugs.
They only eat algae.

They're vegetarian.

Usually, fish guts are too bitter to eat,
but sweetfish guts are delicious.

It's because they're not carnivores.

So with that logic in mind,

all the meat we consider delicious
is from herbivorous animals!

Cows, pigs, and chickens!

The better their feed,
the better they taste!

Which leads us to this conclusion...

Humans would taste gross
because they eat meat!

Well? How do you like the
opinion I came up with?

I see. That's actually rather convincing.

That whole thing that comes up in
novels about human flesh tasting good

is a flat-out lie!

I, uh... I actually eat a lot more vegetables
and fruits than meat, though...

Then you might actually be pretty tasty!

Narancia, don't egg him on!

Hey, you're late, Bucciarati.

You know Leaky Eye Luca, who's in
charge of the airport, right?

His dead body was just discovered.

I've been ordered by the
capo Polpo to check it out.

I hate that guy. He deserved to die.

He had no qualms about tormenting the weak,

and he sold drugs to kids.

He probably got high and
hit his head or something.

Narancia, you may feel that way deep
inside, but don't actually say it.

Think about the world we live in.

Do you want me to look into this?

You're going to be a capo someday.

You don't need to trouble yourself
with such trivial matters.

No, I'll be looking into this myself.

By the way, Fugo...

Oh, right. You have a guest.

He's been waiting for you all morning.

He's a civilian who runs a
flower shop in Monsanto Plaza.

I've looked into him already.

He's an ordinary, responsible gentleman,

but he lost his only
daughter six months ago.

Mr. Bucciarati... As you can see,
my legs don't work so well,

and I came here without my wife,
who usually accompanies me,

so I apologize for coming here alone.

Do you pay your taxes?

I beg your pardon?

Do you always honestly pay the taxes
you owe to this country on time?

Of course I do...

I don't know what you came
here to talk to me about,

but a civilian like you shouldn't be here.

If you properly pay your taxes,

you should go talk to the police or
anyone else who deals with the law.

The moment you start talking
to me, you'll end up in

far deeper debt to the organization
than you can even imagine.

I, just like everyone else in this country,

have worked hard for my family,
believed in the law,

and raised my child with proper morals.

She was my only daughter.

She had turned seventeen last September.

I apologize if I sound overbearing,

but I'd like to continue this
conversation with you in private.

If you want to continue
this conversation...

They all trust me greatly,
and I also trust them.

And you're asking me to interrupt their
meal and tell them to go outside?

I can't do that.

This happened a few months ago...

My wife told me that my
daughter had a boyfriend.

I heard that he was a young sculptor
who was just getting started.

That was fine and all, but despite the
fact that he was older than my daughter,

he never came to introduce
himself to us, her parents.

That got to me.

And shortly after...

my daughter jumped off the roof
of his apartment building,

holding a strange rock sculpture he had
made, and plunged into the courtyard...

I'm terribly sorry for
losing my composure...

Why do my tears hurt so much?

My daughter was my hope...

My daughter shone with youthful beauty...

I want you to avenge my daughter!

Please make that man pay!

Hang on a second.

Are you saying this was murder?

Are you implying that this boyfriend
pushed her off the roof?

If a murder happened in this town,
I would have heard about it.

The police refused to look into
it further and ruled it a suicide.

Even my lawyer!

But there's something that
only her family knows...

My daughter would never commit suicide!

Both my wife and I can say
that with confidence!

Please! I want you to settle
this once and for all!

Please make him, the bastard who's still
living his life as usual, experience

these tears of despair that I'm crying!

Life is full of hardships.

I feel for you, but I can't agree to this.

Are you trying to imply that we're some
assassins who would lynch just anyone?

Everyone in this town relies on you.

I'm just asking for the rightful punishment!

The rightful punishment?

Florist, earlier, you asked
if we could talk privately.

That was because you knew how
dangerous this conversation is, wasn't it?

But what you said about something
only her family would know...

I can't take that lightly.

To think that no one involved
with the law was moved by

those words in the past six months...

I find that rather unbelievable.

I can at least try to make
this boyfriend talk.

I'll only ask for that payment once
we confirm that he's actually guilty.

Does that work for you?

Mr. Bucciarati!

Mista.

I'd like you to look into this.

Sure.

Bad luck

What the heck...

Bad luck

is this rock?

Kill me

Mista, make sure you put that back.

Uh... Did I knock this rock... off of its stand?

Was it always here?

Be careful when you stand up.

Make sure you don't hit that rock.

Mista, Bucciarati says we
can drive you partway.

Right...

Mista, here's the address
to the apartment building.

Here's a picture of the boyfriend.

Find him and make him talk.

You can get a little rough
with him if you need to.

Make sure you get a confession.

You've got a tape recorder, right?

Yeah... But how far should I go?

I mean, if he actually ends up being
a murderer and killed that girl...

We aren't assassins.

Make it so he can't walk for four or five
years, and leave the rest to the police.

I'm sure that'll satisfy the
florist's need for revenge.

Menacing

Hey, where are you going?

Hurry up and get in the car.
I'm gonna leave you behind.

Mista! Do you want a ride or not?
Are you taking a piss?

I'm not! Yes, I want a ride!
I'll be right there!

What's been bothering you, Mista?

Well, there's something that's been
bugging me about the florist's story.

He mentioned that when his
daughter jumped off the roof,

she was holding some kind of rock, right?

Did he mention what kind of rock it was?

A rock?

Like, the shape of it...

How big was the rock?
The boyfriend is a sculptor, right?

He said it was a strange-looking rock.

Yeah, but what exactly did this
strange-looking rock look like?

He only said it looked strange.

What are you getting at, Mista?

Wait, that stone back there...

S-Stop the car for a sec, Fugo!
Stop the car!

Why?

Just stop the damn ca—

Why do you want me to stop the car?

E-Er, never mind...

I was just seeing things.

It's nothing.

Are you all right?

How much wine did you have earlier?

Hey! I'm not drunk!

Sorry for saying something stupid!

I'm terribly sorry for all the trouble!

That's his apartment building, right?

You can drop me off here.

Oh, for crying out loud...

Shouldn't someone else go
with Mista on this job?

Should I accompany him?

No, I'll go with Mista.

I just remembered the rumor about Stand
users gathering in this town for some reason.

You take care of the investigation
of Leaky Eye Luca.

Understood.

So the guy's apartment is
on the seventh floor...

And above that is the roof.

His name is Scolippi...

The courtyard...

So this is where the florist's daughter...

That's a Stand!

This incident involves a Stand user!

And what the hell is this rock?!

Bucciarati!

Episodio 39
The Sleeping SlaveNo one can escape the fate that was chosen for them.

All that remains is the end, where you will all perish.

Episodio 39 The Sleeping Slave

Bucciarati? This stone is
definitely shaped like...

Hey! Are you the sculptor?!

Who the hell are you?!

Don't you dare try anything!

I didn't kill you because
I was ordered not to,

but now that I know you're a Stand user,

there's no guarantee that I won't add
another hole between your eye sockets!

Who the hell are you?

How do you know Bucciarati?

The florist's daughter falling
to her death is concerning,

but why did you follow
me from the restaurant?

Daughter?

Are you a police officer?

No, the police wouldn't—

Listen up, you sick bastard!
I'll be the one asking questions here!

You just need to answer!

Just concentrate on that.

Got that? Don't even think about
saying or doing anything else!

That also includes lying to me. Got it?

All right... I'll ask you
one question at a time.

First off, are you in a gang?

Do you belong to some organization?

I can find out later if I look into it, of course.

N-No... I'm just a sculptor.

I'm not famous, but I
make a living off of it.

Then how did you become a Stand user?

I don't even know what a Stand is.

If you mean this ability...

It just started happening
while I was still a child.

Was it the same for you?

Hey!

Next question. Why did you
follow me from the restaurant?

And how do you know Bucciarati?

Bucciarati...

Bucciarati... Is that his name?

Let me see him, please! He came
with you to this building, right?

Hey, hey, hey, hey!

You didn't answer my question, you moron!

I-It's probably not an answer you'll like...

But this rock moves on its own,
regardless of how I think or feel.

It's been like that ever since I was a kid.

It's a power that I have no control over.

The rock didn't follow you.

It was following him... Bucciarati.

Oh, is that so?

Do you want me to make it so you
can never hold a chisel again?

Sorry to break it to you, but Bucciarati's
far away from here, you dumbass!

You're the one who's lying.

Bucciarati should be in
this apartment building.

Let me see him. His life depends on—

Don't mess with me!

Why did you kill the florist's daughter?
What are you after—

What the hell are you doing?!

I told you to not try anything funny!

The rock has left...

What?!

One of the greatest sculptors in
history, Michelangelo, once said...

"I don't have any thoughts when
I take hold of a marble slab.

Every block of stone already
has a statue inside it,

and it is the task of the
sculptor to discover it."

What the hell are you babbling
about, you bastard?!

You're going to die if you don't hurry
up and bring that rock back here!

Michelangelo was saying that the ultimate
statue is not created from an idea.

It already dwells within
the stone as its destiny.

He was an artist who could see
that destiny as he sculpted.

It's not that I sculpted that rock
into the shape of Bucciarati,

and neither did your bullets.

That is the shape of destiny.

The statue had a hole in its
chest that was gushing out blood.

I don't know if it's in a few
days or in a few months,

but that's going to be how
Bucciarati eventually dies.

We're all slaves to fate.

That's the meaning behind my
ability, Prophecy Stones.

This is your last chance!
Bring the rock back here now!

If you die, so will your Stand!
You get that, don't you?!

If he touches my Prophecy Stones,
he can die without suffering.

I wanted to see him so I could
at least hear his last words...

Wh-What the hell is this guy's problem?

Is he mocking me?

How the hell can he be so calm, damn it?!

Fine! You want your brain splattered
onto that rock so badly?

Look! There are three shots left.

This is how you use destiny!

You're apparently trying to
do something to Bucciarati,

so bring that rock back here right now!

You're the one who doesn't
have time or chances!

I told you. There's nothing more I can do.

Bring it back here right now, God damn it!

The florist had a hard time walking, right?

He doesn't know it yet,

but it's an early symptom of some
disease in one of his internal organs.

He'll most likely survive, though.

When his daughter died,
her organs were preserved.

He'll receive them as transplants.

The girl found out from the rock

that she'd contract the same
disease in a few months.

She understood that and believed it.

She decided to die while she was
healthy for her father's sake,

rather than die in pain later.

So she accepted the rock, and...

The rock allowed her to
die without suffering,

and in a way in which her
organs weren't crushed.

You have some nerve saying that when
you're the one who killed her!

Wh-What?!

It's a misfire, Mista!

That bullet was a dud!

That's impossible!

That bullet is Number 5's responsibility!

Aw, why me?

I cannot die yet.

Because the rock hasn't carved my death yet.

Y-You think you're going to get
two duds in a row, you jackass?!

You caught a glimpse of destiny just now.

You no longer have any
intention of shooting me.

Am I wrong?

Wh-What's with this guy? Damn it!

What the hell is he talking about?

Is he still messing with me?

Hello, Fugo?

Tell Bucciarati that this
sculptor is a Stand user!

What?

This bastard keeps mentioning Bucciarati,

but I can't really tell
what's going on by myself!

What are you talking about, Mista?
You still haven't met up with him?

Huh?

Bucciarati headed to that
apartment building a while ago.

He followed you right after
you got out of the car.

Hello? Mista? What's wrong?

What?!

Bad luck

Prophecy Stones

Scolippi

Wh-What's the number,
Fugo? I have to find him!

What's the number to the phone
Bucciarati has right now?

Are you all right?

The one you're calling
right now is Bucciarati's.

Hello, Mista? Hello?

Hurry, Bullets! Find Bucciarati!

Mista? Hello?

Hey, wake up, you sculptor bastard!

How can I stop that rock?

Hey, wake up, would you?!

Answer me, God damn it!

What do I need to do to stop that
rock from getting to Bucciarati?!

P-Please... Tell me.

I'm starting to understand what you told me.

But what the hell am I supposed to do?

I can't let Bucciarati touch
that rock, no matter what.

I can't.

Please, tell me.

It'd be better and easier...

if you two didn't defy the rock...

No one's been able to do it before,
but if you're able to destroy that rock

or change its shape, then...

We found him, Mista!

We found Bucciarati!

We got a report from
Number 1 that he found him!

Bucciarati's on the seventh floor!

The stairs! Bucciarati used the stairs!

What?!

Th-This isn't good!

The rock! The rock is on the stairs, too!

The rock is right in front of Bucciarati!

Stop him, Number 1!

Tell him not to touch that rock!

It's no use, Mista!

Number 1's bullet doesn't have enough
power left to fly over there.

Bucciarati!

Yee-haw!

Bullets?

We did it!

That was close!

Its shape is falling apart!

That's great and all...

B-But I have a feeling we
might've made things worse...

Bullets, what in the world is going on here?

Is that a Stand?

And its shape...

Run, Bucciarati!

Zipper Man!

Don't attack it!

It's bad news if you touch it!

Run down here, Bucciarati!

Mista!

You can't touch that rock!

If you lay even a finger on it, you'll die!

What do you mean?

I'll explain the details later!

Is that rock a Stand?

Hurry and get downstairs!

Get out of this building and
get as far away as possible!

What? This happened in
the elevator earlier, too...

Sh-Shit! These stairs are dangerous!

We need to find another way down.

Going down these stairs is a bad idea!

Go up, Bucciarati!

Wh-Where is it?

It's not here! Damn it!

Where did it go?!

Mista, what's going on?

Sh-Shit!

Above you, Bucciarati!

Bucciarati!

Wh-What's this face on this rock?

If we can destroy the rock
or change its shape...

Mista!

If I just smash it into the pavement
from here, it should break into pieces!

Damn it!

You're not getting away!

That's impossible! Mista!

Damn it... What that
sculptor bastard said...

turned out to be true...

If you don't appear in the rock,
then it's not your time to die yet...

What the hell have you been doing, Mista?

You left the tape recorder
on the car seat, you dumbass.

Hey... It's you, Fugo...

What was this rock?

Mista, what chain of
coincidences led to this?

Uh... You should be fine now.

I, uh... don't even know
how to explain all this.

Anyway, about the florist's
daughter's death...

The sculptor was sort of the suspect,

but not exactly the suspect...

I hurt him enough to land him in the
hospital for a couple of months, though...

I still have no idea what the
hell you're talking about.

Was he an enemy or not?

Was it suicide or not?

Explain it all in a more orderly fashion!

That's just it, though...

It's really, uh... hard to sort
everything out in my head.

Simply put, we destroyed the
rock, so everything's over now.

Hey, Bucciarati, I'll look into
the incident with Leaky Eye Luca.

No, it'd probably be quicker
to look into it myself

than have you try to explain what happened.

It's a job I can do on my own.

Fugo, try to get a decent explanation
out of Mista so we can explain

what happened here to the florist.

Bucciarati, I'm willing
to do anything for you,

I'm not sure how I should say this...

but do you really think I can
understand what he's saying?

You can stop thinking now.

We'll just use Abbacchio's Moody Jazz.

Over...

Everything is over, you say?

If you had just accepted Prophecy Stones,
everything would've ended peacefully...

We're all slaves to fate.

We cannot change what has
already taken shape.

I don't know who they are, but now
they're going to face a difficult path,

and some of them will lose their lives.

But...

Are they all like this?

He jumped from up there to destroy
the rock for his friend, Bucciarati.

The path filled with hardships
that they're about to walk

might have some meaning.

Their hardships may end up
being someone else's hope,

and might be the beginning
to some greater meaning.

I can't wish for their safety, but I
pray that they are sleeping slaves.

Sleeping slaves who will find
some meaning once they awaken.

Hey, hurry up!

Who's gonna heal Bucciarati's
injuries if you don't hurry up?

Hey, Giorno!

Whoa, be careful, Trish.

Thanks. Something suddenly
appeared near my feet...

Menacing

Trish?

Hey, Trish! Wh-Where'd you go, Trish?

Trish!

Hey, Giorno! Where the hell is Trish?!

Unbelievable... Trish is right there, Mista.

Mista, Giorno, I'm right here.

I didn't trip on this rock.
It's what was in its shadow.

Don't leave me behind.

If you leave me behind,

I don't know how many days it'll
take me to get to the Colosseum.

Polnareff?!

Mr. Polnareff.

You're still alive.

But if all our minds were switched back,

then your soul... and the turtle...

My body is dead.

But the moment my soul got sucked out,

I was able to hang on to this turtle Stand.

I can't leave this key, but I decided
to live here for a while as a ghost.

Well, it's great and all that you're okay,

but it's not over yet.

We're going to the Colosseum
to heal Bucciarati's wounds.

Bucciarati? But his soul...

Hey, what are you doing?!

Oh, uh, sorry!

I was just thinking that you're right...

I think I might actually smell weird.

So this is what I smell like?

Maybe I'll start using cologne...

Really?

I might've said something weird back then,

and maybe it's because I was panicked,
but it doesn't bother me anymore.

It almost even feels nostalgic.

Really? Really?

Yes. But your fingers are still weird.

What are you going to do with that?

Those who carry on the will of those who
have passed must keep moving forward.

I won't destroy this arrow.

Keep the arrow inside the turtle.

That will do, Giorno.

That is the duty of those who have survived.

Let's go

to the Colosseum.
