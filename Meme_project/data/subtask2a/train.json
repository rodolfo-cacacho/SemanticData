In contrast to this false radical Leftist's position\\n(which wants true democracy for the people, but without the secret police to fight counterrevolution,\\nwithout their academic privileges being threatened), a Leninist, like a Conservative, is authentic in the\\nsense of fully assuming the consequences of his choice, i.e. of being fully aware of what it\\nactually means to take power and to exert it.\\ - Slavoj Žižek",
